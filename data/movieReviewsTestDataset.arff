negativeC,' tristar / 1 : 30 / 1997 / r ( language , violence , dennis rodman ) cast : jean-claude van damme ; mickey rourke ; dennis rodman ; natacha lindinger ; paul freeman director : tsui hark screenplay : dan jakoby ; paul mones ripe with explosions , mass death and really weird hairdos , tsui hark s " double team " must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean-claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie-bedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career . actually , in " double team , " neither s performance is all that bad . i ve always been the one critic to defend van damme -- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars ( namely steven seagal ) never aim for ; it s just that he s never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994 s " timecop . " and rodman . . . well , he s pretty much rodman . he s extremely colorful , and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t , even if the role is that of an ex-cia weapons expert . it s the story that needs some major work . van damme plays counter-terrorist operative jack quinn , who teams up with arms dealer yaz ( rodman ) to rub out deadly gangster stavros ( mickey rourke , all beefy and weird-looking ) in an antwerp amusement park . the job is botched when stavros  son gets killed in the gunfire , and quinn is taken off to an island known as " the colony " -- a think tank for soldiers " too valuable to kill " but " too dangerous to set free . " quinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife ( natacha lindinger ) , but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her . so , what s a kickboxing mercenary to do ? quinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman , kill stavros , save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do . with crazy , often eye-popping camera work by peter pau and rodman s lite brite locks , " double team " should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure . but too much tries to happen in each frame , and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated . the numerous action scenes are loud and headache-inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what s going on in the movie . and much of what s going on is just wacky . there s a whole segment devoted to net-surfing monks that i have yet to figure out . and the climax finds quinn going head-to-head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle , trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinn s baby boy ( who s in a bomb equipped basket ) -- all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers . did i mention " double team " is strange ? when it all comes down , this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon , albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity . rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona , though , leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs . but we didn t need " double team " to tell us he could do that , did we ? © 1997 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/ '

( vecsey is both a paragon of sports writers and an excellent author of non-sports books , including " loretta lynn , coal miner s daughter " the bestseller which became a great movie ) . i quote : " now the american women are hot , but , then again , america lives for temporary diversion and instant gratification -- new pop groups , new sunglasses , new cars , new internet stocks . " one might add to this many other items , including new movies , such as arlington road . the following day i received a tbs announcement for a made-for-cable film , first daughter , about the kidnapping of the president s daughter by american terrorists . as voltaire said about god , " if he didn t exist , he should have been invented . " hollywood , in the absence of that so-useful big bad soviet bear , predictably turned to world-wide terrorism , including home-grown american destroyers . as in arlington road , an ambitious but disappointing opus . at d . c .  s george washington university , professor faraday ( bridges ) teaches courses on terrorism . he s a widower with his boy , grant . his fbi-agent wife , was killed in a federal cock-up . faraday is being semi-consoled by brooke , one of his graduate students . he lives on arlington road where he makes friends with neighbors oliver ( robbins ) and cheryl lang ( cusack ) . then he begins to suspect that oliver is not the architect he claims to be , but a terrorist leader . . . the film open with the protracted , unexplained sequence . a heavily bloodied , badly burnt boy staggers down a street . just as you think that he ll fall down dead , he is rescued by michael faraday who drives him to a hospital . it s all done as a skillful " internal " montage , whose horror , however , does not really hide goofs and improbabilities . item : in a close-up , a drop of blood falls on one of the boy s sneakers . seconds later , the same sneaker has no blood . item : arlington road is a suburban street flanked by many houses and lawns but i cannot remember seeing any people around . it is far too convenient that the only driver who notices the kid s predicament is faraday . item : the child rapidly goes from apparent death throes to a lightning-fast recovery with one arm in a cast as the only visible sign . the explanation of the boy s condition , given by his parents , the langs , is a fireworks accident . all this is an artificial gimmick to have faraday and the langs meet and develop nice , neighborly relations . the couple has a boy , brady , and two girls . brady and grant become best friends . this is held in reserve for future , nefarious purposes . it is also is a gimmick for dis-alienating the orphan grant who disapproves of papa s girlfriend brooke , and for turning the 8-year old into a " regular american boy , " a fact that gets worked into the plot . another ho-hummer . michael faraday s questioning of oliver s kosher-ness as a designer of malls starts with his 2-seconds  glimpse of plans that are not of a mall but of an office building . quick eyes , what ? item : when later michael needs to look at those plans by getting into the lang house when the couple is not there , the two little girls who open the door are uncharacteristically pan-faced and suspicious ; michael s excuses for entering are woolly-minded , blatantly dumb . so is his search . item : brooke , rather thinking that michael s suspicions are paranoid , is an unbelievably obtuse naysayer . so is the fbi agent , a friend of michael s . cliche item : when a good person is feverishly phoning about a discovery from a pay-phone , and turns around , the enemy is standing there . improbable item : michael is checking old newspaper files about oliver . . . who suddenly appears behind him . cliche item : the obligatory as well as unbelievable car chase . impossible item : the way chasers and chased connect . goof item : a car is hit broadsides ; next that side is shown undamaged . [here i eliminate about dozens of other items]the finale is highly improbable but does score a point by going against the guesses of audiences conditioned by too many action good vs . evil flicks . i won t disclose it . the script of arlington road-- a name evoking red , white and blue patriotism-- wastes much money and technical talent during its two hours where nothing makes sense . its photography and editing are artsy not arty . story an dialogue go overboard with deviousness and indirection . has no one learned from alfred hitchcock the value of clarity ? . the whole is an alienating mess , and a probably uncalled for stress on large-scale , minutely organized , hugely financed ( but by whom ? ) american terrorism . the movie s events are under the sign of the world trade center and oklahoma city bombings , and the mess at ruby ridge . consciously or not , it connects with such good pictures as the invasion of the body snatchers , the stepford wives , seconds , rosemary s baby , et al . , that is , films where people are not what they seem to be . rescuing it from total destruction are good performances by bridges who is convincing in his pain and obsessions ; by robbins who is smooth and would be frightening if credible ; and by the clever casting of ever-charming joan cusack as a wolf in lamb s clothing .

negativeC,' the brady bunch movie is less a motion picture than a minor pop event . forget your reruns and forget your nick at nite ; this dead-on recreation of the fabled seventies sitcom is both so exhilarating and * so disturbing that you half-expect to see the ghost of rod serling appear in the narrative . did we really act this way twenty years ago ? of course not . the genius of the brady bunch movie is how it heightens the surreality of the family unit from hell by fast-forwarding them into the future . it s 1995 and greg still calls the chicks " groovy , " and marsha still considers hair-brushing the high point of her day . bell bottoms are in , and alice has yet to move out . nothing has changed within the garish walls of brady manor and , so , the plot has the family stepping out into the real world , where they are confronted by everything from carjackers to lesbians . granted , nothing * too * serious happens here . with the exception of some heavy sexual innuendo , the brady bunch movie is about as sanitary as the source material . and that s too bad . director betty thomas ( of tv s " hill street blues " fame ) doesn t cut between real-life and brady-life enough to make the contrast as glaring as it should be . the edge isn t sharp enough . * we * know that what we re watching is funky , though , so it s not that much of a problem . nor are the glaring low production standards . the cast is uniformly appealing . shelly long seems to have found her niche under awful hair , while gary cole is right on the mark with dad s sing-song truisms . christine taylor is the best of the brady kids . she s a cheery delight as marsha * and * is a dead ringer for maureen mccormick . her foil is jennifer elise cox , who is a howl as the brooding jan .

negativeC,' janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . this is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . it also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too . garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that s made the kennedy family so popular . so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . she soon learns why " easier said than done " is the mantra of movies like this . the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can t get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on . then comes what roger ebert calls the " meet cute . " it happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way . in the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side . no points for guessing it s the same dog that just made water on her luggage . also no points for guessing garofalo hates o hara on sight . that s how it works in movies like these . i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she d hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they d reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . i haven t mentioned the movie s twist yet . garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . milo o shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . rest assured he ll do all he can to match up garofalo and o hara . oh , and in keeping with the matchmaker s utter predictability , he dies toward the end . what the message here ? sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script . i was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together . leary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . he even undoes himself with the old microphone s still on after he s done giving the speech cliche . both of them should have known better . visit the movie critic at large homepage at http : //www . missouri . edu/~c667778/movies . html close to 1 , 000 reviews with a comedic flair . . .

negativeC,' i m going to keep this plot summary brief , something i wish mr . warren had done with his " film " ( i know , " manos " only runs 74 minutes , but that s not brief enough ) . michael ( hal warren ) leads his family on a trip out into the middle of nowhere . after being lost for a great deal of time , they stumble across a lodge run by torgo ( the late john reynolds ) , a small man with large knees . torgo informs the family that he watches the house while the master ( tom neyman ) is away . michael insists on torgo allowing his family to stay , despite the fact that michael s wife , margaret ( the late diane mahree ) , and daughter , debbie ( stephanie nielson ) , aren t too keen on staying . torgo relents and slowly carries the family s luggage into the house . meanwhile , the master awakens , and his wives ( jackey neyman , sherry proctor , robin redd ) vie for his favor by wrestling in the mud . i m afraid i m not an eloquent enough writer to adequately describe the experience that is " manos , the hands of fate " . i don t believe i can do justice to this diamond in the rough ; this magnificent piece of filmmaking that is - oh forget it , i can t even say it . " manos , the hands of fate " is , arguably , the worst movie of all time . imagine , if you will , the following : hal warren , a fertilizer salesman , bets a friend that he can make a popular horror film on a minimal budget . he hires several actors who have little to no experience or training ( he himself has no experience or training ) , and leads the cast through a script which consists of long spells of nothingness occurring . you re no doubt wondering why i have referred to cast members as " the late " ; it s because after the film was finished , and the cast laughed out of the theater at its premier , three ( that s right , three ) cast members committed suicide . " manos " ( which means hands , by the way ) has since become a legendary film ; one which can only be watched under one of three circumstances : you re completely drunk , completely insane , or completely asleep . while looking over the list of actors involved in this project , you ll most likely realize that none of the names sound familiar . that s because each cast member sealed his/her acting fate by appearing in this " movie " . not one actor involved went on to make any other picture . could appearing in a bad movie really do this to one s career ? it s doubtful . for example , barry pepper will no doubt go on to make other films after " battlefield earth " ( which is not to say " battlefield earth " is in the same league as " manos " ) . the chief reason none of these actors went on to other films is because none of them could act . hal warren was as incompetent in front of the camera as he was behind it ; tom neyman made van damme look like an oscar winner ; and diane mahree s part consisted of , well , nothing really . the only two actors worth noting are john reynolds and stephanie nielson . stephanie nielson may have been only a child , but she outdid every adult in the film ( she s no doubt in a mental institute somewhere after experiencing this movie ) . john reynolds , who was sadly one of the three casualties of this war , actually showed some small trace of talent . do i mean he was good ? not in the slightest . yet , i think if he d received some schooling and experience he might have gone on to a small career . so what does a movie look like when there s no budget ? well , picture " the blair witch project " without the scares ( oh wait , there were no scares in " blair witch " ) , the extras , the scenery , or the nice cameras . you see , " manos , the hands of fate " was filmed with such a cheap , ancient camera that the film could only be shot in thirty two second bursts . this means there are fades and/or cuts every thirty two seconds for no reason . the costuming in " manos " is rather interesting . there are really only three different bits of costuming : the wives  undergarments , which they wear while fighting each other ; the master s cloak of hands , which is a large cloak covered in large hands ( something involving the god manos , whom he serves ) ; and torgo s knees . torgo s knees , by the way , may look like nothing more than large anomalies stuck to his legs , but they re actually an ingenious invention thought up by john reynolds . torgo is actually supposed to be a satyr , and the large knees were supposed to represent goat legs . i m not quite sure how reynolds thought this up , and i m not sure how we were supposed to know they were goat legs , and i m not even sure why torgo is supposed to be a satyr , but there you have it . there are two more things worth noting in " manos " . one is the dialogue , particularly that of torgo ; the other is the soundtrack . torgo s dialogue generally consists of repeating the same phrases over and over again . for example , when asked about the master s health , torgo states : " dead ? no , madam . not dead the way you know it . he is with us always . not dead the way you know it . he is with us always . " i think warren wanted to emphasize the fact that he wasn t dead like we know it , but i could be wrong . torgo also states , in a line vaguely ( very vaguely ) reminiscent of a classic line from rosalie crutchley in " the haunting " : " there is no way out of here . it ll be dark soon . there is no way out of here . " it should be noted that the camera used was so ancient and decrepit that it could not record sound . therefore , all the characters voices were dubbed by four different people : hal warren , hal s wife , and two friends . the soundtrack to " manos " is certainly one of the high-points . after some strange and out of place lounge music in the film s opening ( which consists of a lot of driving ) we settle into the torgo theme , which is made up of six notes played over and over again till you re certain your ears will begin to bleed . if i haven t made this film sound bad enough , and you are unfortunate enough to go and witness it , i do apologize . i d recommend " manos , the hands of fate " to those who simply adore classic bad movies ( because this one ranks amongst the worst ) and award it a full one out of five stars . comments ? send to : johnbeachem@dependentfilms . netpast reviews can be found at : http : //www . epinions . com/user-elerad ? public=yes or http : //us . imdb . com/reviewsby ? john + beachem * * * * * - one of the best movies of the year . * * * * - great flick , try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie , hits and misses . * * - pretty bad , see it at your own risk . * - see this one only if you enjoy pain . get your private , free e-mail from msn hotmail at http : //www . hotmail . com .  share information about yourself , create your own public profile at http : //profiles . msn . com .

negativeC,' review by lars lindahl ( larsattacks@mail . com ) starring norm macdonald , dave chapelle , elaine stritch , sherman hemsley , daniel benzali , and danny devito the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending . watching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise . when the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification . this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more . good surprises make movies fun to watch . then there are the bad twists . you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i m talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid . screwed perfectly suits the latter description . what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on . by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs . larry flynt , scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing . whoops . screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments . norm macdonald stars as willard filmore , a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich , old , insidious boss , miss crock ( elaine stritch ) . when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day , willard is convinced by his best friend rusty ( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock s beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars . too excited to pay any attention , the hapless losers  plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home . now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends , realizing they can make even more money , decide to stage the fake kidnapping . of course , everything that could go wrong does . the first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad . but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear . the more idiotic these characters get , the more reckless the script becomes . at one point , i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters : " no , you idiot ! " i m not just talking about willard and rusty , who were extremely annoying , i m also talking about the cops in this film . a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys ( headed by murder one s daniel benzali ) were just too clueless to forgive . they give real cops bad names . also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days . looking almost identical to his penguin in batman : returns , every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief . he just didn t belong in this movie . macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was , gross out humor is certainly not his forte . if you re a fan of norm macdonald s other chaotic comedy , dirty work , you might actually love this near-sequel . otherwise , don t get screwed out of your hard-earned money .

negativeC,' after enduring mariah carey s film debut , glitter , i m reminded of a bit from chris rock s bigger and blacker . in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , " you can drive a car with your feet , but that don t mean it should be done . " to that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don t mean it should be done . sure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles  a hard day s night to the spice girls  spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter . everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous . start off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie . the film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers . worse yet , everyone s speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 . meant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother . influential club dj julian dice , a . k . a . " lucky 7 " ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro ) , hears her sing on a track , and decides to make her a star . in predictably rapid succession , billie and dice fall for each other , she starts hitting it big , dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass , and suddenly billie s on " the roller coaster of superstardom . " in the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom . i won t give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows . . . you ll figure it out . the movie screams to be made with camp , and that could ve been fun . but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better . what a mistake . the brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie s first music video -- go over like lead balloons . instead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah s most dramatic scenes . which brings us to the performances , of which there s nothing good that can be said . mariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face . she actually looks scared during her one love scene . but you have to wonder if the writing isn t even worse . so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey s virginal target audience that it s probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb . even the characters couldn t have been written more absurdly . they re all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , " billie , i d love to put you in a movie i m making , " and the big-time record executive who takes billie s demo tape and says , " oh , i ll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . " everyone in the film is a device , and it s painful to keep watching just to see another one appear . to say more would be a waste . there s so much wrong with this film . and , it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she s likely to get . but , then again , i had to suffer through her movie .

negativeC,' here s a rarity : a children s film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject , is there a god ? done well , it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children s cinema . unfortunately , it isn t . with jumbled messages , and an unclear audience , wide awake was better left asleep . fifth grader joshua beal ( joseph cross ) is in the middle of a moral crisis . his beloved grandfather ( robert loggia ) has died , and joshua has begun a quest . he wants to find god , to discover why bad things happen . this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents ( dana delany and denis leary ) , but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths . at his catholic school , his favorite teacher , sister terry ( rosie o donnell ) , tries to give him guidance , but this is a journey he must make on his own . meanwhile , he is having the most momentous year of his life . he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave ( timothy reifsnyder ) , he gets his first crush , and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey . it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be . on its surface , it appears to be a kid s film . however , it deals with serious issues , and is likely to be boring for today s instant-gratification kids . and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience , wide awake asks serious questions , but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer . if there were a bit more meat in the story , adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie . the actors who might have created a great cast ( o donnell , leary and delany ) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos . the nostalgic elements ( best friend , favorite teacher , first crush , etc . ) have been done much better in other movies , and actually seem more like filler here . the film s strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua s relationship with his grandfather . they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie . maybe the film would have been better if , instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks , it were set entirely during joshua s last year with his grandpa . it certainly would have been more entertaining . wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment . it starts out with noble aspirations , but never delivers on its promise . parents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions . . . that is if their kids aren t bored to death first .

negativeC,' the haunting  -a review by bill chambers ( haunting@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring lili taylor , liam neeson , catherine zeta-jones , owen wilson screenplay by david self , based on the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson directed by jan de bont " some houses are born bad , " goes the haunting s tag line , to which i must add , " some movies , too . " nothing short of hiring a new cast , a more literate screenwriter , and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson s meritorious novel . the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy , and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don t frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout " boo . " fragile nell ( taylor ) , bisexual theo ( zeta-jones ) , and smiley luke ( wilson ) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders , hosted by professor marrow ( neeson ) . marrow s secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house s bleak history . he s not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew , nell especially , who has some ancestral connection to the manor s previous inhabitants . taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead . for starters , her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes , when we re introduced to the mansion and all its fun-house trappings . her character is supposed to be depressed , having tended to an unloving mother for too many years , but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame , alternately grouchy , mopey , wiggy and pathetic , and i kept wondering why the other characters didn t just ditch this bitch . as for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones , she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her . unfortunately , she s saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer . theo s assessment of the house ? " i love it ! sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters . " who on earth would say that in place of " citizen kane meets the munsters " ? ( furthermore , would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? ) both actresses fare better than neeson , who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason ) , and his character is the most bland . as luke puts it , dr . marrow pulls the old " academic bait and switch " on his subjects , but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he s accused . later , he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it s amusing to hear neeson shout " nell " repeatedly , given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name ) . why was this nice , helpful , and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ? the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti . his sets are obsessively detailed , and even before the cgi kicks in , they seem alive , never quite still . i do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots , nottinghamshire s harlaxton manor , is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house . eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically . thank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke , in that it was actually enjoyable , de bont has served up another ride , sans thrill . his images , well-lit though they are , have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact , whole sequences , not to mention the cloaked , airy ghoul who owns the climax , feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back , peter jackson s the frighteners . i don t mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist , i mean to suggest that he s a hack , having found no new ways to give us chills . '
negativeC,' in brief : i think your response to the good son will depend on your response to the question of evil . i found the film excellent--and disturbing . i was uncomfortable throughout . it focuses on one thing--evil--and tries to look at it on its own terms , barring any easy ways out . most of our profs would have said that evil is * really * ignorance , or bad reasoning , or blindness , or unchecked emotionalism , or the result of a bad environment , a terrible childhood , some traumatic event , etc . , etc . , etc . if you think that , then the good son might be a nice little thriller for you , but maybe a little too low-key , too bland . if , further , you think that it s preposterous that a * kid * could really be * evil * , then the film will be still harder to take . but what if evil is a real moral stance , a live threat in human affairs ? what if it is , or can be , a * decision * ? what if it s something that can never be completely removed by education or compassion or prosperity , etc . , etc . , etc . ? ( which is what some of our old-line thomist and calvinist profs warned us . ) to the extent you think that--or at least can enter into the mindset--then the good son will be a disturbing analysis of evil . even if it shows its origin in the genre of the thriller , its main action will be a confrontation with genuine evil in an apparently cheerful , appealing kid .

negativeC,'  1995 , g , 90 minutes [1 hour , 30 minutes] [comedy] starring : michael roescher ( hank royce ) , kristy young ( jinnie sue macallister ) , justin garms ( voice of gordy ) , james donadio ( gilbert sipes ) , written by leslie stevens , jay sommers , dick chevillat , produced by sybil robson , directed by mark lewis . " gordy " is not a movie , it is a 90-minute-long " sesame street " skit , and a very bad one at that . this movie is so stupid and dumb that it s depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light , and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie . i m sure children are the target audience of this movie , but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it . it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms ) , whose family has been taken away to " up north , " which we know means death . of course we can hear the animals talk to each other , and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible . actually , it s almost funny in a way . the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears , a little girl named jinnie sue macallister ( young ) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him . jinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it . what is the point of this ? maybe she is one of the producer s relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something . we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce ( roescher ) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating . he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue , but he accidentally falls in a pool ( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a $200 suit on - nah , didn t see that one coming ! ) , starts to drown , and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him . if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank s grandfather , the original ceo , dies and leaves his fortune to hank . . . and gordy ! of course there must be a villain , but even this villain ( donadio as sipes ) isn t that evil . he never raises his voice or becomes angry , and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story . it s hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film , or if the filmmaker s are just this untalented and stupid . at times " gordy " is tolerable to watch , thus earning it one star and not the dreaded " z- . " but it s just so unbelievably boring , cliche , dumb , unfunny , corny , and just plain bad it may scare children , it certainly disturbed me .

" obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment , and so to finish us utterly , they have now released " urban legends : final cut " . this is another " scream " -like feature , consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip-offs from the most pointless movies of all time . amy ( jennifer morrison ) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do . but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university s film program -- where each year s best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize , a virtual one-way ticket to hollywood success -- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese ( loretta devine ) , whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines . soon enough , fake -- and real -- blood starts to flow , and amy is being chased around by scary killer , while her cast and crew get slain , one by one . is the culprit the original urban legends murderer , just some random psycho , ! a member of the faculty , one of her competitors for the hitchcock , or is there something even more stupid going on ? this is another one of those tiring , pointless teen slasher flicks : neither scary , funny , or interesting . it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain . the body counts and screams continue to grow , as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly . in fact watching films like that after having watched " scary movie " is impossible keeping a serious face . several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing , without succeeding . and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing . it s the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century . how many times must we tolerate the same clichés that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth ? it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them . they are the most stupid , meaningless , predictable and soulless films in existence . however , director john ottman manages to make " urban legends : final cut " into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre . what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in " scream " , ottman takes seriously . for that reason alone , it is worth a look , just to realize how bad a movie can be . it s tough to find comparisons for such an achievement , and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect . even movies like " lost in space " and " mission to mars " seem spectacular in its shadow . we have not seen such waste of t ! ime and resources since " showgirls " ( 1995 ) . no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production , i came up with nothing , except the way the killer was dressed . here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie-sylvie deveu , that have wisely replaced the well known scream-mask with a very elegant fencing mask . jennifer morrison ( " stir of echoes " ) is all right , and the other actors  best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script . in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film ( with the exception of its screenplay ) is its portray of film schools . if these graduates will be the directors of the future , then hollywood s golden days are over . rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment . let s just hope and pray that it s just an urban legend .

negativeC,' rated on a 4-star scale screening venue : odeon ( liverpool city centre ) released in the uk by columbia tristar on 24 march , 2000 ; certificate 15 ; 125 minutes ; country of origin usa ; aspect ratio 1 . 85 : 1 directed by james mangold ; produced by cathy konrad , douglas wick . written by lisa loomer , james mangold , anna hamilton phelan ; based on the book by susanna kaysen . photographed by jack green ; edited by kevin tent . " girl , interrupted " argues that mental institutions keep the sane and release the unstable , because of stuffy procedures and restrictive rules written by bureaucratic doctors disconnected from reality . while i am sure these things are true , the film never makes us care , because its heroine is a bitchy little nut-job . " haven t you ever confused a dream with reality , stolen something when you had the cash , or thought your train moving as it sat in the station ? " she pleads with us in the opening scenes . but that s not the kind of behaviour she s being locked up for . this is a young lady who responds " what ? " whenever anyone asks her a question , drifts into daydreaming in the middle of sentences and thinks it s perfectly acceptable to guzzle great quantities of pills and vodka . her name is susanna kaysen , a real-life figure whose book this movie is based on . if the film is anything to go by , i m lucky that i never read it . " girl , interrupted " is a pathetic example of someone denying she s in denial ; it s as stupid as sylvia plath s " the bell jar " without the engaging style . there are journal entries in the film we re supposed to accept as profound philosophising . most of them are just the kind of pretentious stream-of-consciousness drivel that many teenage girls write , only to look back on years later and cringe with embarrassment . the story is set in the 1960s -- boys are being shipped to their deaths in vietnam , and susanna ( winona ryder ) thinks she s got a hard life because her mother is hassling her about going to college . after a suicide attempt , she is encouraged to sign herself into claymoore , an expensive mental hospital where the head nurse ( whoopi goldberg ) gives a straightforwardly accurate diagnosis : " you are a lazy , self-indulgent little girl who is driving herself crazy . " susanna does a lot of mellow lying around , drunk on her own superiority , convinced she s " artistic " rather than crazy . fellow inmate lisa ( angelina jolie ) offers her support , probably because the two women have the same problem -- thinking they know the secrets of the universe , when they re actually defective jerks . other friendly faces include a pathological liar ( clea duvall ) and a girl who likes to set herself on fire ( elisabeth moss ) . anyone in a position of authority , or who displays the least bit of conventionality , is portrayed as an uptight white-collar conservative square . i am reminded of " reality bites " ( 1994 ) , another film starring ryder in which the alleged heroes were self-obsessed layabout losers . " girl , interrupted " is moronic and arrogant crap , not least because its obnoxious onscreen behaviour is accompanied by a voice-over that asks , essentially , " can you believe these stuffed shirts thought i was obnoxious ? " perhaps the book or true events would lead me to a different conclusion , but the susanna kaysen of this film could use a good hard slap in the face . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantganiplease visit , and encourage others to visit , the uk critic s website , which is located at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic '

negativeC,' loser  -a review by bill chambers ( bill@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring jason biggs , mena suvari , greg kinnear written and directed by amy heckerling * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films , director amy heckerling s latest , loser , seesaws between unpleasant and artificial , and is sometimes both at once . when she tackles big issues , such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high , it s impossible to tell whether she s being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) , but whatever the case , she continually refuses to comment politically . such is the sitcom tendency of her work : to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button . this fear of drama soured me on fast times . . . , look who s talking , clueless , and now loser , in which ms . heckerling also demonstrates , for the first time , zero affinity for the milieu . has anyone , for instance , ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvari s dora ? attired in black thrift , her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips , she accepts the label of goth , but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging , as dora does , those geriatric rockers everclear , nor willingly went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger . the mechanics of loser s tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non-specificity , so that they become even less than stereotypes . they become walking wardrobes . small-town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs ) , our eponymous hero , always wears his woolly hunter s cap with flaps covering the ears , and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn t scream " shemp " ( the lame stooge ) wig louder . he has three smug-looking roommates ( the one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers , but they share similar facial features , including and especially mouths ) , and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam . though they re not overtly transvestites , heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy ; how very cruising of her . ( the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged . dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions . unfortunately , either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated . ) when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare , he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott ( superb greg kinnear ) . although paul s already in love with dora by this point , as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name , he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott . she s thrilled , but nevertheless spends a few days at paul s to recuperate ; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play ( " cabaret " ) , and just when paul s got in his head that she s starting to love him back in that non-friendly way , she decides to become alcott s live-in girlfriend . cue precious hommage to the graduate , shots of paul drifting around berkeley--er . . . ( aside : simon & garfunkel s " parsley , sage , rosemary & thyme " should never have been allowed in another motion picture . ) heckerling has a lot in common with nora " you ve got mail " ephron , the only other prominent chick directing comedies today , in that neither has any use for strong-willed women . men continue to trod on dora until the bitter end ( in the final scene , she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum ) , and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will--mere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned , she s cheerily redecorating his apartment . ( heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue titles . ) goth veneer aside , there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora , and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them . heckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model , and while such arcs may not be heckerling s social responsibility , it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes . ( consider , too , that dora is the film s sole female principal . ) not that loser is worth contemplating this seriously--god knows heckerling didn t . that is her hallmark .

negativeC,' david mamet is a good director . mamet s an even better screenwriter and playwright . the guy s authored some of the best film and theatre works in the past decade -- the verdict , house of games , wag the dog , state and main , and the guy even won a pulitzer prize for his play glengarry glen ross . with that said , it s such a shame that his latest crime caper , heist , falls apart by employing too many of the well-known devices of a mamet production -- double-crossing femmes fatale , overtly memorable characters , and deceptive plot lines . but movies like the spanish prisoner , things change , and the winslow boy display a roundness to mamet s innate abilities . and it s almost a crime to witness how all of that goes awry in his latest film , heist . heist twists and turns along the road of documenting the shady life of career jewel thief joe moore ( gene hackman ) and his posse of thieves -- bobby blane ( delroy lindo ) and don " pinky " pincus ( ricky jay ) . during a raid on a jewelry store , moore ends up with his mug on the surveillance cameras and he goes on the lam from the local marshals . he decides to get out of dodge with his recent bride fran ( rebecca pidgeon , looking like a cross between sharon stone and joan crawford ) , sailing into the sunset on his yacht . the only problem is that his fence bergman ( danny devito ) has set up a big score -- the swiss job -- which he wants done so badly he holds joe s cut of the jewelry heist on layaway until the swiss job is done . to ensure his faithful hound brings the goods home intact , bergman tosses his nephew jimmy silk ( sam rockwell ) into joe s crew for observation purposes . things become complicated when joe s wife has an affair with jimmy , the swiss job turns sour , devito starts acting like his character from ruthless people , and ricky jay starts looking for the exit to this mess of a film . a mamet production usually derives its success from a solid emotional attachment to its characters -- usually they ve been wronged and are seeking justice or absolution . the naïve scientist from the spanish prisoner or the curious psychologist from house of games were just decent people we recognize in our everyday lives . when those people get royally screwed over , its human nature to desire retribution . heist lacks any such emotional attachment . of greater concern is the recycling of plot points from ronin , which mamet also wrote and which deals with a similar plot involving double-crossing thieves on the run . to save the day , though , heist carries some of the best actors working today . devito , lindo , and hackman chew up and spit out the scenery around them . sam rockwell -- who usually plays naïve and jovial characters in movies like galaxy quest -- plays silk as cold , manipulative , and downright spooky . but the main problem with heist is how surprisingly predictable the story is . unlike the similar yet far superior the score , there s never any surprise during heist s twisting . mamet has just become lazy with this one . everything about the film looks great , but there s nothing at all underneath . reviewed as part of our coverage of the 24th annual mill valley film festival .

negativeC,' hush reviewed by jamie peckrating :  tristar / 1 : 32 / 1998 / pg-13 ( language , violence , brief nudity , sexuality ) cast : jessica lange ; gwyneth paltrow ; johnathon schaech ; nina foch ; debi mazar ; hal holbrook ; richard lineback ; kaiulani lee director : johnathan darby screenplay : johnathan darby ; jane rusconi call " hush " " stop or my mom will kill . " or " mommy fearest . " or " the hand that robs the cradle . " call it whatever you want , but certainly don t see it unless you re in desperate need of a bad movie-induced chuckle -- " hush " scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure . chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering ( it was supposed to open about a year ago ) , the latter of which appears to have given " hush " a send-off that s downright infuriating . it s too bad that " hush " is so laughable , because the on-screen talent -- including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange -- is nothing to laugh at . paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson , a photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy , well-to-do family s horse farm/estate kilronan . jackson s mother martha ( lange ) runs kilronan all by herself , and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately -- even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether , caught red-handed after a bedroom romp with her husband-to-be . but it seems that martha s friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor ; she s what you d call someone who loves too much . martha eagerly , deviously wants a grandchild , and then helen will be expendable , as far as she s concerned . if there s one reason to catch " hush , " it s lange . she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated , injecting martha ( poorly written though she may be ) with a little empathy to level out the psycho-playing field . when she delves into martha s dark side , predictable cliches -- chain-smoking , staring in mirrors , praying in a confessional to a priest who isn t there , poking a hole in helen s diaphragm so she ll become pregnant ( and she does ) -- abound , but it s moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch . veteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jackson s wheelchair-bound paternal grandmother . the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable , especially paltrow . but can you really blame them ? the character relationships in " hush " hold a certain amount of promise , at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity . idiotic situations ( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over ) compliment idiotic dialogue ( " why did you yell ? " helen yells back at martha ) , and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank-from-hell flicks ever made . you can see through a great deal of martha s actions and lies from their conception ; why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out ? does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town ? if any of her potential victims thought , acted or behaved like normal people , " hush " would be a really short movie . and then there s the climax and ending , which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor-inducing drug normally used on horses . after a really weird chase scene , martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself . i won t spoil what happens next except to say that it s contradictory , illogical and ( probably , since i m no doctor ) medically impossible . the final scene offers no closure , no resolution , no confrontation whatsoever . it s just there , dangling amidst silent displeasure . no one should like this ending , regardless of their feelings on the preceding material . perhaps " hush "  s title is a plea to silence its audience s likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater .

negativeC,' promoting itself as " an instructional dance film , " twist purports to chronicle the evolution of rock-and-roll dance . instead it jumbles together a wide and disjointed assortment of nostalgic images , leaving the audience to figure out what it s all about . as a result , twist is a dance documentary with two left feet . the film is structured as eight dance " lessons , " complete with flashy title boards , but there s nothing especially unique to be learned from each section . canadian producer/director ron mann uses a combination of old film and television footage and interviews with now middle-aged american bandstand dancers and recording artists . he spotlights these performers by having them jiggle in front of heavily stylized backgrounds and , frankly , it s embarrassing . it s clear from the observations of betty ( romantini ) begg , carole ( scaldeferri ) spada and floss ( harvey ) mancini why they are dancers , not commentators , as mann allows them to ramble on even though they have almost nothing to say . in addition , hank ballard , joey dee , and to some extent chubby checker come across as egotistical jerks--surely not the director s intention . the film kicks off with the early 1950s , when ballroom dancing was all the rage . in the juke joints and nightclubs of harlem , places like smalls , the apollo and the savoy , a rising young star called hank ballard and his group the midnighters were performing their hits , songs like " get it , " " sexy ways , " and the infamous " work with me annie . " ballard s lyrics were raw and suggestive . with the arrival of such notables as elvis presley , disc jockeys on radio stations like philadelphia s wdas stopped calling ballard s style of music r&b and started calling it rock and roll-- " to attract the white kids . " on wfil-tv s american bandstand , regulars on the show started imitating the black kids and claiming the dance steps as their own . mann s interview with bandstand dancers joan ( buck ) kiene and jimmy peatross attempts to illustrate how the white mainstream ripped off the african- american culture . as a political message it s too simplistic ; mann lingers on their shallow repetitiveness and misses the opportunity to make a major statement . most of the information presented in twist isn t new--the fact that rock and roll was considered to be a " communicable disease " under eisenhower s presidency , for example--but the section on the twist itself is informative and well-structured . in 1959 , ballard s recording " the twist " took the nation by storm . twisting was easy ; you just moved your hips . as legend has it , dick clark assumed that the song would be too dirty coming from ballard , and it didn t show up on bandstand until the cleaner-imaged chubby checker recorded his version in 1960 . a year later the dance had become a world-wide sensation and the song returned to number one , spawning over 300 twist spin-offs . it was probably the first time those immortal words " it s got a good beat and you can dance to it " were spoken on prime time tv . at a new york club called the peppermint lounge , manhattan s rich and famous were rubbing shoulders with the commonfolk to get in on the action . for a brief moment the film becomes quite fascinating ; we learn how influential the twist really was , starting fashion trends and saturating popular culture . if only the rest of the film could have maintained this momentum . unfortunately , mann follows this portion of the film with a downward-spiraling epilogue that simply flings more contrived dance floor maneuvers in our face . the swim , the jerk , the watusi--all less successful derivations . the hully gully and the hucklebuck ; imitations that paled by comparison . when the british invaded in 1964 , one kind of musical hysteria was traded for another . for all the shimmying and shaking going on in the film , twist is amazingly lacking in energy . the archive footage is varied and often fun ( a clip in which marshall mcluhan shares his thoughts on the dance craze , for example , is a howl ) , but mann does very little with it . many scenes lack continuity . after a while , the frenzied black-and-white footage of teenagers bopping and jitterbugging becomes repetitive and ultimately boring . it s hard to tell the fly from the frug , the millie from the monkey . even though twist runs only seventy-eight minutes , it s a long haul . it s not clear whether twist is supposed to be a celebration , a tribute , or a condensed history lesson . as a simple account of dance styles from the fifties and sixties , it s poorly-conceived ( it would have made a fine short film ) . for all its instructional aspirations , twist doesn t know when to lead and when to follow .

" the film s title must refer to the impatience of the kids to leave adolescence for maturity , as well as to the state of english in schools . following the seniors  graduation ceremony , their class has the usual ritualistic bash--in the home of a girl who ought to have known better than volunteer the place . the party is a rite of passage --not the rites of spring but the trites of spring . the motto , as in other such events , must be brew and screw . for its characters , the filmmakers round up the usual suspects , all of them types found in the teen genre . if there is some originality here , it is well-hidden by cliches gathered from earlier flicks . chw s deja vu types and actions make up a pot-pourri , an expression where " pourri " means " putrid . " but this epithet would be too strong a condemnation of a movie whose main guilt is total superficiality . the action almost entirely takes place at the shindig . celebrants range from geeks to nerds to jocks to cuties . without a central plot or guiding thread , the whole thing is just a collection of skin-deep subplots . the main one is this : athletic mike , the bmoc , has just dumped amanda , his girl since freshman class , as part of " game plan " with his pals . the idea is that those among them who are going on to college will have women by the regiment falling into their arms and beds , so why not break with the boys  current liaisons ? it s not only a dumb idea but a revoltingly cynical one . learning this , college-bound would-be writer preston wants to declare his love to now-uncommitted amanda . he is a likable , shy fellow who has been adoring her silently ever since they both were freshmen . in a flashback to four years ago , the movie goofs by showing amanda , preston and others looking exactly as they do now . add to this the sin that hollywood has been committing since silent movie days and in many contemporary films as well : too many screen students --high-schoolers or undergraduates--are perceptibly older than they would be in real life . preston comes to the party with his confidante and best pal denise . she is brainy a la janeane garofalo , even looks like a mix of garofalo and a young kathy bates . she lacks confidence in her own appearance , is outside the girlish loop , critical of others , has a mordant tongue . another subplot will involve her being accidentally locked inside a bathroom with seth , with predictable consequences . he is a white boy whose solution to having an identity has been to adopt a black personality in dress , speech , manners , music , and the like . ( there are , by the way , some merely token minority students at the party ) as for amanda , she s been a kind of first lady all along , queen of this and of that . she is nice but , like almost everyone else , not a thinking person . ( you wonder how the vague preston will perform as a writer ) amanda does get the film  s main profundity when she realizes ( and confesses a bit pathetically ) that all her glory came from being mike s satellite . with some people , it takes time to see the obvious . i will not mention other characters , events or gratuitous developments of chw . the partygoers , are without exception not just undeveloped but undersketched . there are few small saving graces . one is the movie s relative briefness . even though the title calls for the joke i could hardly wait for it to finish , i did not find it unbearable -- just blah . another is that preston is neither depicted as pathologically shy nor as a caricature intellectual . there are no drop-dead gorgeous women . and , in a near-surreal sight , as preston tries to use a public phone , a woman , a tired stripper with fake angel wings , hassles him for the use of the cabin . she is played by the uncredited jenna elfman , who recently had a major part in krippendorf s tribe and is married to the nephew of composer danny elfman . obviously made for high-schoolers who may or may not get some mini-shocks of recognition , and full of references to current pop culture , chw will survive only if its target audience shows up .

" original sin " will never join such treasures as " valley of the dolls , " " road house " and " showgirls " in the bad movie hall of fame , but it ll do until something worse comes along . the film , adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel , " waltz into darkness " ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film , " mississippi mermaid " ) , opens in a turn-of-the-century prison , as jolie s character , slated for a dawn execution , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny . the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like , " this is not a love story , it is a story about love . " wary of local gold-diggers , cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas ( banderas ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america , listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers . a practical man , luis chooses a frumpy looking lady , hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children . imagine his surprise when his fiancée , julia russell ( jolie ) , turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo . julia explains that she sent a different woman s image because she didn t want to be selected solely for her pretty face . luis then confesses his deception , leading julie to state , with great significance , " we have something in common , we are both not to trusted . " after their wedding , luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking , with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible . jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun , although the filmmakers  insistence on using one of banderas  legs to cover jolie s crotch makes it look like he s trying to climb her . luis , the stupidest man who ever lived , immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia , despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded . his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up . luis must force julia to write to her sister emily , who is frantic over her lack of communication . shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird , it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck . finally , when she cleans out his accounts and disappears , luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong . incidentally , if you re afraid i m giving too much away , rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie , leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists , a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass . along the way , private detective walter downs ( played by thomas jane , who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie " 61 * " ) turns up , hired by the frumpy woman s sister to find out what happened to the real julia . luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist , having decided that if he can t have her , he will kill her . oh , the pathos of it all . the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story , adjusting their performances accordingly . banderas is suitably impassioned , while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting ( and with those lips , she can really pout ) . as for thomas jane , he starts off acting suspicious and cagey , then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness . his most startling moment comes when , to prove his power to humiliate , he forces luis against a wall , verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full-on kiss . if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape , show them this chilling scene . and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler , show them " original sin .

negativeC,' yes , august is upon us and with it comes the second appearance of the twice-yearly dumping ground for hollywood . like the february doldrums , august brings us films filled with fading stars and awful storylines that weren t deemed good enough to break even after a big summer marketing campaign , nor will they be able to go toe to toe with meatier fare during oscar season . and to open august , enter bless the child , possibly the worst movie i ve seen this year . well , after mission to mars . swallow hard before reading this ridiculous plot synopsis , which i can already tell is going to be painful to type . in a nutshell , jesus has returned to earth in the form of a little girl ( holliston coleman ) , who is abandoned by her druggie mother ( angela bettis ) as an infant , to be raised by aunt maggie ( kim basinger ) . six years later , satan s minions are out to kill the girl , of course . and this year , satan s head minion is a new agey creep named eric stark ( rufus sewell ) , determined to convert the jesus girl to the dark side before easter . . . or else she must die ! ( i guess they picked easter because , you know , they missed the whole millennial paranoia genre window by about a year . ) enter an occult-expert fbi agent ( jimmy smits ) and you ve got a kind of cop-thriller-paranormal sixth sense wannabe that makes apocalyptic pap like end of days look like the seventh seal . while young coleman is a gifted actress , the movie has her doing little more than beating her head against the wall , hugging people , or spinning stuff with her magical powers ( backed up by lousy digital effects ) . basinger proves that , yes , l . a . confidential was a total fluke and that she can t act after all . and sewell appears to be channeling dr . evil for his goofy bad guy role . while christina ricci is being used to sell this film to the unsuspecting masses , her part is barely a cameo comprising three minutes of screen time . but bad acting doesn t kill bless the child , it s the bad plot that aborts this production . driven by randomness , coincidence , and just plain stupidity on the part of the characters , the movie wanders from scene to scene with little more purpose than filling 100 minutes before we get to the inevitable showdown at the end . this has been a successful m . o . for action films for a century -- but few have had the gall to try to work in a god vs . devil plot . the film is so over the top that maggie s car , when falling off a bridge , can t just splash into the water -- it has to explode into flames on the way down . the film is so derivative it actually steals lines from other movies ( notably a slight variation on " the greatest trick the devil pulled was convincing the world he didn t exist " from the usual suspects ) . and the film is so amazingly obvious that you expect stark s limo to have " 666 " on the license plates . altogether , bless the child is almost bad enough to become a cult classic .

" hollow man " features a string of hapless , c-list actors ( among them bacon , elisabeth shue , josh brolin , and kim dickens ) in a grade-z plot with a lot of special effects that , frankly , don t look much better than those used in the 1933 version of " the invisible man . " oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he s attempting reentry but otherwise it s lots of " thermal " shots and inanimate objects ( elisabeth shue included ) bobbing around without any visible signs of support . since invisibility , once achieved , isn t much of an effect ( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other--it amounts to much of a muchness ) , the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely-buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon s character gets invisible he can head straight for them . it s as if that fascinating concept--what would you do if no one could see you ? --is simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin . as a horror film , " hollow man " is unsophisticated and disturbing ( in its intent , not its achievements ) and not worth your time or your hard-earned dollars . it s minor verhoeven--and even that s not saying much--and boy is it hollow .

" simpatico " doesn t involve us in its story , so much as it blackmails us into it . yes , i kept wondering what was going to happen next , but not because i cared -- i simply wanted to make sense of it all . the film s method is to throw a lot of bewildering information at us , and keep us watching by promising it ll all be sorted out by the end . the main characters are carter ( jeff bridges ) , a successful businessman whose acres of property include a sleek country mansion , and vinnie ( nick nolte ) , an angry slob whose rotting bungalow lies in the middle of sandy nowhere . as the movie opens , carter is getting ready to sell his family s prized racehorse , but is interrupted from the deal by a phone call from vinnie , who orders him to come cross-country to see him . carter immediately hops on a plane . with the possible exception of hugh grant , millionaires don t often abandon their busy schedules to visit shady bums , so what strange hold does vinnie have on carter ? after a lot of unspecific talk about  the past " , we learn that years ago the two men were involved together in gambling and bribery scams , and vinnie has always held onto proof of these illegal actions that could destroy carter s credibility in legitimate circles . since vinnie is more than a little unstable , carter does not want to upset him , and appeases his old friend as much as he can . we get the sense that this arrangement has been going for quite some time -- vinny making threats , carter giving him things to keep him quiet . things may not , however , be so simple this time . vinny is really starting to act like he ll do something with his evidence ; perhaps he ll expose carter , perhaps just re-open old wounds for the man s wife rosie ( sharon stone ) , whose part in her husband s extortion rackets left her permanently emotionally scarred . right there is , more or less , the whole story of " simpatico " , which unfolds in an odd manner : characters pop up onscreen now and again talking about secretive things the audience don t know anything about . flashbacks appear , to explain tiny pieces of the puzzle . then come moments of quiet reflection . while this deliberately perplexing method of storytelling must have seemed like a hot idea to the filmmakers , because it lets them stretch their meagre plot out to feature length , it leaves the audience at a loss to understand whether or not the actors  performances are any good . we re never let know what the motivations of the characters are , let alone whether these motivations are being played convincingly . nolte and bridges do a lot of grunting and shouting ; stone appears far too late in the film for her passionate anger to redeem the dullness of the script . albert finney , playing a man vinnie and carter ruined , does a lot of weird babbling in a typically terrible american accent ; catherine keener , as a checkout girl who never wanted to be involved with a bunch of crooks , switches between tough cookie and gullible simpleton , often within the same scene . maybe all this made sense in the sam shepard stage play upon which " simpatico " is based . it doesn t in the movie . this would have been a fascinating piece of work if the plot had been outlined in the opening twenty minutes , and the rest of the script had focused on the characters . who are these people ? who were they ? how do they feel about each other ? how did the consequences of their swindles specifically affect them ?

negativeC,' _dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . mitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs . but as the trailer goes , " there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . " so he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . in fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam s father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie . so for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a heart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . not that there isn t a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort . there are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam s impotent father s ongoing lust for them . and for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america s_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . but the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ? the answer is a resounding no . it s not that macdonald isn t a funny guy . he was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn t hurt that he s a natural , likable screen presence . he is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don t work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . still , macdonald s few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . the late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . the film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . come to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ .

" bullfighter is ultimately a blatant ripoff of robert rodriguez s el mariachi , made for obviously no money by indie vet l . m . kit carson and his crew . strangely enough , rodriguez actually has a cameo in this movie , which says to me he s paying off carson for all his support of indie filmmaking . and while el mariachi is a truly great film , bullfighter is anything but . the story is supposed to be farcical ( i think ) , but it just comes off as stupid and tiresome . the camerawork is bad , the editing is atrocious ( each scene transition uses a grating jump-back-and-forth-five-times method which makes you want to kill yourself after 10 minutes of it ) . the special effects typically involve a strobe light . this is not a good thing . what is mildly good is forbes ( the only real actor in the picture ) , and martinez makes for a curiously understated action hero . if only he didn t mutter all his lines beneath his breath , thus rendering the picture even less comprehensible .

" i am not a whore ! i am a dancer " , she screams , but does it in such an over dramatized way that you ll start laughing . in fact the acting in " showgirls " brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level . not one single achievement , besides the conventional cinematography , is worth mentioning . it is a total waste of time and money . there is not a single moment of what you might call intelligence . the dialogue is structured of ancient stereotypes and cliches lined up one after another . its attempt to even imagine to have half a brain results in a catastrophe . " in my films , " writes director paul verhoeven (  basic instinct  ,  total recall  ) , " i hold the mirror up to life . " well , excuse me ? his attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas , and as he put it " show the naked truth " , is simplified and unreal . occasionally , between his collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities , screenwriter joe eszterhas ( the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history ) inserts some lines of deep morality , that sound something like this : " hey , i see you . i see that you re hiding " - " from what ? " - " from you " . yes , and even the only decent line in this film : " nomi is what las vegas is all about " can t save  showgirls  from going under . it s a strange phenomena . it s not erotic , because it lacks sensuality . not dramatic , because it lacks the acting . and not intelligent because it lacks a story . it is simply verhoven s bad excuse for making pornography . you want to see naked women ? bare breasts ? full frontals ? it s nothing wrong with that . but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store , and not waste time surviving through eszterhas  pathetic dialogue . b qualities , while it s only a high budget porn-film .

negativeC,' " my problem was being a young man with money in manhattan , " says bret easton ellis , citing his inspiration for american psycho . when it comes to vivid fantasies of alienated urban narcissism , his prose strikes a chilling , edgy chord . like skimming the surface of an icy lake , we are left imagining the dark depths below . hey , that really sounds poetic ! i m gonna have another valium before writing the rest of this review -- maybe someday i ll be as glib as ellis ! just kidding . i ve actually enjoyed reading ellis  novels of passive emptiness . less than zero is the perfect book for road trips , especially when you look out the window having thoughts that resemble the shallow characters . " ah , yes , adolescence truly is a volatile mystery ! " having said that , ellis prose typically comes off as , well , boring , glib , pseudo-intellectual , snooty , irritating , and shallow when read aloud . try reading passages to your friends . watch them lose interest in you as a human being . don t scoff ! if you were in their shoes , you would , too ! heck , you probably will if you attempt to sit through gerald fox s unintentionally grating documentary , this is not an exit : the fictional world of bret easton ellis . fox tries to pull off the imaginative conceit of crossing interview footage of ellis with dramatizations from his body of work , including less than zero and his recent perils-of-celebrity bestseller , glamorama . it s like a kaleidoscope of short films with additional commentary from the novelist . unfortunately for ellis , he s so smug , creepy , and annoying that he does his novels a disservice by appearing onscreen . potential readers will take one look at this privileged brat and understandably vow never to read him . i haven t even started discussing ellis  whiny friends , hogging for screen time as they take a limo cruise through new york city searching for the perfect restaurant . it s scary that his unimaginative fictional characters bear such a scary resemblance to his actual peers . when one of them compares him to orson welles ( " cuz you re a big genius , bret ! " ) , i wanted to slap that pompous grin off his mug . okay , maybe i m jealous that i don t have ellis  problems . beautiful friends , a fat wallet , the inability to see through my own vapidity . maybe i m being too hard on the guy . gotta calm my nerves before i finish this review . pass the cocaine . a bottom-of-the-barrel budget doesn t help illuminate the scenes lifted from ellis  novels . rough , jarring cuts and washed out cinematography are completely inappropriate for the polished world his characters inhabit . the bland white walls and inept lighting could have been easily better-realized by inexperienced first year film students . the poorly staged ellis stories serve as a reminder of how right mary harron s instincts were on american psycho . by dwelling on impeccable art design , tailored suits , embossed business cards and designer glasses , she found the precise visual counterpart to ellis  hyper-detailed take on consumer culture . bored , introverted characters with zero empathy can be compelling on the page , but it doesn t always translate to the screen . christian bale s mannered performance as psycho s killer patrick bateman was appropriately deadpan . would that declan thurman ( uma s brother ) showed such restraint filling the same role in exit . he blows line readings with a distracting assortment of eyebrow and lip twitches . see , i m really crazy ! there s nothing hammy about ellis  sparse writing style , so why can t thurman resist maniacal laughter when describing a girl s head on a stick ? by discussing the " meaning " of his books , ellis only winds up reducing them to facile morality lessons . he also eats up screen time defending his prose from vicious critics , often protesting far too much for comfort . i don t hate women ! american psycho is a feminist tract ! less than zero was not autobiographical ! it s a sensationalized version of my post-college years . this vain little man seems to care an awful lot about what people think of him . oh , go ahead ! try telling him that and he ll retreat back into a banal shell of doublespeak . as one critic points out , it s almost impossible to discuss ellis  flaws without him embracing them as part of his integrity . of course it s shallow , of course it s nihilistic ! that s the world he created . see how slippery he is ? what was that great bill murray quote from rushmore ? " money can buy a lot of things , but it can t buy you backbone . take dead aim at the rich kids ! " i don t think i ever truly appreciated that slice of wisdom until ellis got in my face . hey bret : here s a quarter . go call someone who cares . and pass the amphetamines . fast . you re losing me .

negativeC,' directed by : andrzej bartkowiak written by : eric bernt ( i ) and mitchell kapner cast : jet li , aalyah , delroy lindo , dmx mpaa : rated r for violence , some language and brief nudity . runtime : usa : 115 in our time . in our modern world , where the cool rule , it s hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming  the man  . and yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic . in warner brothers  latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away . though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare s  romeo and juliet  , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare s poetry . the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese . the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered . the afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers . it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother s death . escaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother s fate . but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty . the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy . . there s only a weak echo of shakespeare s talent in this disappointing production . and there are more problems besides its title . of course we don t call it a deformation of a great masterpiece . we call it  modernization  . it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights . this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing . kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn t need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature . and as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare . i must admit that i found  rome must die  very confusing . i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing . he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision . unfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments . his latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow . the love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified . jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice . their achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act . they are nothing more than two celebrities put together . the other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances . delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality . but there s more than acting to worry about . even with li s incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing . to make a long story short :  romeo must die  is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film . it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to  romeo and juliet  , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be . and in the end it s nothing . there are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character- or story surprises . so again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement . this film can boast of great sound , fast paced editing , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences . the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre . it is mostly provided by aalyah s enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists , that create a kind of  ghetto feel  to it . but when i think back , it s not much i remember from this  production  . as in almost every summer movie , there are some interesting scenes , but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects . it is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities , simply because it doesn t have any . for someone who has never read shakespeare , it s another popcorn film . for those of us who has , it s a waste of money , time and brain cells .

negativeC,' director : luis llosa writer : alexandra solos ( based on the novel by john shirley ) starring : sylvester stallone , sharon stone , james woods , rod steiger , eric roberts sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime , but this has got to be one of the worst . a totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting , " the specialist " is about as exciting as an episode of " dragnet , " and about as well acted . even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script , stupid and unlikable characters , and just plain nothingness . who knew a big explosion could be so boring and anti-climactic ? unless you saw " blown away " . . . " the specliast " of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone ( in comeback #19 , i think ) , who plays a quiet , hermit-like bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something , but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant ( james woods , who shows us exactly what over-the-top is , other than another bad sly film ) accidentally killed some innocent people during a job . his credo is killing bad people , not innocents . and that s why he makes big bombs . so anyway , into his life steps the seductive sharon stone , who is basically the girlfriend/moll of the stupid son ( eric roberts ) of a cuban/miami kingpin ( rod steiger , in an indecipherable accent , which is sometimes cuban , sometimes brando , sometimes scottish , etc ) . turns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him , since he killed her parents when she was young . so she calls sly , leaves messages with him , sends him e-mail , etc , about planting a bomb to kill roberts , which sly listens to obsessively , and while he works out naked . yea . also into his life , though again , comes woods , who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly . using the cops , he tries to set up traps , none which really work , so when sly calls him , he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone , getting so worked up by saying his must-be-improvised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open . these are the most exciting scenes in the film , and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film . the film tries to offer us a moody film noir , except with explosions , but comes up completely snake-eyes . it s just a pretend film noir , making it a big waste of time . and for action buffs , the action scenes are pretty lame , with some really unrealistic-looking special effects ( a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub ) . then there s the much-discussed sex scene between sly and stone , which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel and ross on " friends . " their sex scene is more nauseating then sexy , because it shows us more of sly than stone . now let s guess who we d rather see naked , okay ? stone s small but perky breasts , which we ve seen more times than harvey keitel s dick , or stallone s veiny ass , which isn t usually shown for a very good reason ? i know i can t really judge it as a flaw of the film , but come on . the worst flaw of the film is this : it s boring . i mean , i was on caffeine when watching it , but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting . but a good movie does not james woods going nuts make . if you re in for some fun action , rent sly s earlier " demolition man , " which sucks too , but in a much more entertaining fashion . skip this dull film , unless you want to see woods , or make fun of steiger s accent , or see stone s breasts again .

negativeC,' fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade . tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies , but the quantity . most of those movies were produced by cannon group , company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus . those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman , b- movie mentors of future hollywood legends . unfortunately , that didn t happened , and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade , behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage , that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal . sadly for bronson , that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead , and lowering his own reputation in process . on the other hand , bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular , especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself . one of such movies that seriously marred bronson s reputation is death wish 3 , third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 . in the original movie , bronson played paul kersey , mild-mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence . that movie was far from masterpiece ; yet , in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time ( on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry ) . unfortunately , six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels ; even the presence of its original director didn t stop the rapid decline of the quality . death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend , living in the urban wasteland of east new york , populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out . before the reunion , kersey s friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker ( played by gavan o herlihy , probably the only noteworthy role in the film ) . kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade , while the police inspector shriker ( ed lauter ) , ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime . bronson , the main asset in this movie , plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine . although bronson s charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower ) , the lack of emotions or bronson s own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film . the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness , so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey s crusade . on the other hand , emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding , yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks , and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey . unfortunately , michael winner doesn t know how to work out the plot , and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations , ends this movie with a bang . the big showdown at the end - that turns east new york into the sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie , because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget . in short , this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia . ( special note for trekkies : marina sirtis , the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek : the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife ) . '
negativeC,' year : 2000 . starring jim carrey , renee zellweger , robert forster , chris cooper , anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon , michael bowman , traylor howard , tony cox . written by peter farrelly , mike cerrone , and bobby farrelly . directed by bobby farrelly and peter farrelly . rated r . it seemed like the perfect concept . what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? it s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . jim carrey s signed on too ? even better . the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers  new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as " schizophrenia , " and so forth . such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers  fire , proving that some people just couldn t take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn t funny . it s not for lack of trying . the farrellys utilize in " me , myself & irene " their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . soon enough , charlie s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . this guy isn t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he s been insulted , or holding a little girl s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . some have suggested that this isn t a problem , because the farrelly brothers  brand of humor doesn t require plot to work . they re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys  last effort , 1996 s " there s something about mary . " ( 1999 s " outside providence " was technically an earlier project . ) the brothers  earlier film wasn t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . in " mary , " the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they d have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . " me , myself & irene , " by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at " mary " and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . having been produced by the same guys who made " mary , " " irene " seems like an even bigger disappointment . the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . but they haven t come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of " me , myself & irene " comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that s entirely predictable from the get-go . ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? yeah , me too . ) the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it s no longer funny , merely gross . the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . take , for example , the subplot involving charlie s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . but by the end of the film , they re still doing the same schitck it hasn t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn t been dropped either . that s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . " me , myself & irene " reeks of wasted opportunities . there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank s actions . this doesn t really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie s condition early on , so they don t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , " whitey " ) , but the script doesn t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in " all of me . " it s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . carrey doesn t pull any stunts we don t expect him to pull , and the farrellys  script doesn t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren t set up in any meaningful way . perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . zellweger s irene is not a strong female lead mary in " mary " may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she s ditzy , clever , or neither . as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only " sane " person in the film . chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . after viewing the shapeless mess that " me , myself & irene " eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . but i don t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they ll rebound just fine . even after that happens , though , i ll still consider " me , myself & irene " to be a high-caliber misfire .

negativeC,' miramax " disinvited " on-line media from press screenings of scream 3 . they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled reviews and post them prior to the film s february 4th release date-unsound reasoning . you see ,  net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals-miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on-line film critics society ( ofcs ) and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain t it cool news . no , the mini major  was afraid we d let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit , that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved ( by this writer , at least ) franchise . something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber ) , the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott , sidney s mother , is juggling phone calls in his luxury car . ( once considered a danger to society , weary now hosts his own talk show , " 100% cotton " , a clever , if dated , jab at american pop culture . ) of course , a new ghostface dials him up , and , with memories of scream s unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind , we immediately wonder , where is the killer ? the backseat ? the next car ? thrilling prospects , to be sure , but actually , ghostface is at the weary residence , waiting for cotton s girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering . what s missing from this sequence , and indeed scream 3 s remaining frights ( most disappointingly , the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes , one of which might spring to life ) , is an elaborate and attenuated payoff . our other surviving regulars have become estranged . sidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks , while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2 s movie-within-a-movie , " stab 3 " , and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program . murder reunites them , as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of " stab 3 " , imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney s death . the appeal of ghostface s villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend , your classmate , your next door neighbour . . . or a combination of people . scream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery , with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next , but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive . ironic self-reflection aside , parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there s at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume . with scream 3 , the novelty of ghostface s ever-mutating identity has worn off some , but the character remains conceptually potent . conceptually . the execution of ghostface s master plan this time around is creaky , because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we d come to understand in scream and scream 2 . the movie gets in the silly habit of saying " all bets are off ! " in reference to the " rules " of a trilogy s third act , but there s a difference between rule breaking and cheating . with the departure of kevin williamson , who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that , for reasons incomprehensible to me , was ignored , save the notion of " stab 3 " ) , kruger needed to be reined in tighter , and by wes craven . craven s direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects . how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies ) , akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny . it pains me to write this , but scream 3 s comedy is generally laughless , with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven s music of the heart ) , jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 ) , and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress ) . the visuals are much weaker in part three , as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming s camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before . ( aside : in the wake of columbine , craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony , when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? ) finally , marco beltrami s music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it s mostly silent . sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here , they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score . i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe , the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels , scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish , and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs . the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : part three must disappoint  .

negativeC,' starring casper van dien , dina meyer , michael ironside , denise richards screenplay by edward neumeier , based on robert a . heinlein s novel directed by paul verhoeven ( if you like this review , and you must have more , visit film freak central http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/set/7504 it s getting better . ) guilt . guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time ; the penultimate t & a thriller , basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living . but i know so well that it s a terrible film , made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt . verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and , on november seventh , 1997 , unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me , who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies . the pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year . a simple , white on black title card reads " starship troopers " -my friends and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped , verhoeven realized he forgot the credits . is this how a hundred million dollar movie should open ? were the rest of the film that subdued . . . starship troopers is about a group of white , blond-haired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names . they graduate high school , join the military , and then , rather curiously , decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet . the story is so incomprehensible , and told so bombastically , it s akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue . ( aside , club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasn t changed in the future . ) one plus : starship troopers contains some very funny sequences , specifically the newsreels of the future . hysterically funny , actually . but the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between . the storytelling lacks focus , to say the least . the politics of the film are scary . the actions of the major female characters are dictated by their out-of-control libidos . there s even a creepy sex scene : the lovely dina meyer makes out , nude , with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater , just the way he seems to like it . i use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor i ve encountered in a big budget picture ; all chiseled features and machismo , he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders . of course , verhoeven s probably the one to blame , and perhaps i m jealous because i m so disgusting . at any rate , a movie called starship troopers shouldn t be about sex . exactly ten years ago , verhoeven made robocop , which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving . and r-rated , despite its goofy premise . maybe it s asking too much for verhoeven to make a pg-movie , then-he s a master of insipid violence . however , ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it .

" --- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl s ( helen slater ) query as to why she s being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl . i ll admit it . . . i love superman iii . i know it s hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it s a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise . supergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series  same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn t even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii . supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time . as the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in " inner space " , go about their daily lives . ok . . . what ? so these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? were they living there before krypton exploded ? how do you get to " inner space " ? this whole " inner space " notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world . how do they know where superman went ? how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me . argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron . one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o  toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman s cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art . kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of " whatever " that protects the city . in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death . . . in three days time , or something . kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world . the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) . selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination . selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she s arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) . supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives . ok . . . huh ? why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? attention movie : explain yourself ! i m sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much . i can t buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to . knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically " wills " herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school . she s given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? lois lane s sister , lucy . ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we re getting really contrived now . what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . . complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) . best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks . at this point i m rapidly wondering why i m bothering with this nonsense . there is some credit to give to the film however . one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an " evil " bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its " prey " is very well done . also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools . hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara s love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film s more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some " menacing " bumper cars ) . then there were numerous little things that bothered me . the flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . . it s all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires . instead of having her look like she s flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be " graceful " , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers . also , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a " wacky " demise . there is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye s , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) . finally , just one word : monsters . faye dunaway and peter o toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o toole overacts he s entertaining and when dunaway does it she s annoying ( her character actually says the line " seize them ! " at one point ) . dunaway s henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty s otis character from the first two superman movies . helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she s written to be , as she s able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . believability aside though , it s still annoying . now despite all this negativity ( and i m not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . yet i m still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) . the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . extras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and " special project consultant " scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . the transfer on this international version is incredible . . . you d think you were watching a new release . images are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . only some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn t much that can be done about that ( unless you re obsessive like george lucas ) . the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you ll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams  classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films  golan-globus production ) . the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there s no dead air on the track . bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . although , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn t get that response . we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the " almost " appearance in the film by christopher reeve . great detail is given about superman s proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . as it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . for the sake of brevity , i won t even get into that one . szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy " whimsical fantasy " nonsense . bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . again , for the sake of brevity , i won t even get into that one . anchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . disc two features the never before seen director s cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don t add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o toole s screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won t care . one question though . . . shouldn t the director s commentary be on the director s cut of the film ? i d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . i was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . i knew the film wasn t beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . at the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . ugh , i give up . i m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie .

negativeC,' as the twin surfer dudes , stew and phil deedle , lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital , phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother . yanking out his iv , he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother s face . this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney s meet the deedles , a movie more to be endured that watched . ( i stopped looking at my wife during the screening , since every time i did , she d start sticking her finger in her throat . and she s right , it is that bad . ) directed without any imagination by steve boyum , whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction , the film limps along at best . boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts , stunts and more stunts . amazingly for someone with his background , he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones , and we have a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more . but who s counting ? and then there is the script by james herzfeld , whose only other film , tapeheads from a decade ago , was so awful that it is considered a cult classic . meet the deedles , however , is painfully bad rather than laughably bad . it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything . herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes " your geyser s a geezer , " and " i d like to put a deedle in her haystack . " as the movie opens , the twins , who at one point describe themselves modestly as " a walking kodak moment , " are celebrating their 18th birthday . as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki , a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski . as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire , the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid-back beach bums into men . as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone , they ve got their surfboards , skateboards , and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire . their camp has gone out of business , but they are mistaken for new park rangers . the rest of the movie has them fighting the park s overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex-ranger , played by dennis hopper , who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration , scheduled for later in the week . hopper , who has made some wonderful movies , carried away being a recent favorite , does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material . this isn t his worst acting , but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he s ever been in . steve van wormer and paul walker , as stew and phil , give lifeless performances . the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey . even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull . to add insult to injury , hennings is fond of inappropriate close-ups , which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog . put a ten-foot pair of lips on the screen , and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said . although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families , one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie s stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road . they make it look like so much fun that i m sure many will try some variation of the stunt . " how could this possibly be worst , " asks phil . just when you suspect it can t , the movie takes a turn further downhill . its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag . after phil s girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil , they suck in a long worm . like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp , their lips finally meet in a kiss . as they pull back , their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested . meet the deedles runs about an hour and a half . it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up . my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas , both almost 9 , gave the show * * * . they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites . nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep , and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo .

( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . ) the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie s christmas setting , and the los angeles/las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to . the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little-known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs don t help or hurt the roles . in fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don t have enough time to make substantial success . although that s almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories . go doesn t have this , and it suffers because of it . as far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme . ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . ) at times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night .

negativeC,' director :   kirk wong cast :   mark wahlberg , lou diamond phillips , christina applegate , avery brooks , bokeem woodbine , lela rochon screenplay :   ben ramsey producers :   wesley snipes , warren zide runtime :   us distribution :   sony pictures/tristar rated r :   violence , language , sex by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) i didn t hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film . for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored . i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it s entertaining to watch it in the same way that it s entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl . as a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries . it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways . it s fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they re doing . unfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don t seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy . the biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place . but it sure is a fascinating failure . marky . . . er , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman . he s a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn t snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) . he works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) . they re a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex . they all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen . it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in . they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father . when they do this , it turns out she is paris  . . . goddaughter ! it s very bad to have paris against you . the story is standard action film stuff . it s nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) . clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it s a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . it s true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) . there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story . they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . melvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . like i said , it s not boring ; most disasters aren t . what makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness . it seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . then , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . then , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy . keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . and scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all . one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator . the scene is played for laughs , but it isn t funny . and since it doesn t quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails . this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . cars land on tree branches and are supported by them . characters betray each other without a second thought . grenades are thrown in tight places . people jump out of tall buildings and survive . people outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . most frustrating of all , though , is the film s definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals . they re more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns ) . the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn t make for deep or interesting people to watch . the acting is kind of fun , though--wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin s fiancée , is convincingly air-headed . the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . the funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners . it s a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . despite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself .

negativeC,' in the first death wish movie , mild-mannered new york architect paul kersey , played by charles bronson , was avenging the death of his wife . in the second , he was avenging his daughter . in the third , he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend . fourth movie , on the other hand , begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen , played by kay lenz . however , since this is death wish movie , we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for . this time karen s teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways . kersey s new targets , unlike the previous movies , aren t the ordinary street punks but rich , heavily armed and well-connected drug dealers . even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support , and it comes from the publisher nathan white ( john p . ryan ) , determined to avenge the drug-related death of his own daughter . white s plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them . the plan begins to take shape , but kersey s actions bring attention of two police detectives - reiner ( george dickerson ) and nozaki ( soon teck-oh ) . fourth ( and , unfortunately , not the final ) installment in the death wish series , will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group , production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade . however , although some critics might argue , death wish 4 : the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 . paul kersey , one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial ) characters of the 1970s , is still being dumbed down by mediocre script , and charles bronson really doesn t feel the need to put much effort in his acting . however , the hand of a veteran director j . lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner s and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal , although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring . there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence , and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end . the script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenz s character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years . there are even some half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional , like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson s 1970s classics . ( special note to x-philes : mith pilleggi , the actor who plays ad skinner in the x- files , could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman ) . '
negativeC,' here we ve got a really rare bird : a film so stupid it can t even make fun of itself properly . you know a culture is in trouble when even its trash doesn t stick to your mind . spice world may not be the worst big-name movie ever made -- i m divided at this point between species ii and money train , with north in the running -- but it s not even a good crummy movie . it s just crummy . i kept begging for a moment of some halfway genuine wit -- a mistake , a sneeze , a sense that they just grabbed something and ran with it instead of staying with the script . no such luck . that script , by the way , plays out like something they scratched onto a soggy cocktail napkin at a producer s party . comparing this movie to a hard day s night would be a sinful mistake . a hard day s night was conceived as a quick exploitation package to cash in on the beatles  popularity , but two things happened : one , the beatles stuck around and became more important than anyone could have guessed ; two , the movie was brilliant . neither exception applies to this film . we get performance segments which are flimsy and witless , padded with revue-type material that doesn t garner a single chuckle , and fistfuls of stuff shoveled in that dates the movie horribly ( like a dumb x-files gag , complete with halogen flashlights ) . the girls are also disturbingly untalented ( again , unlike the beatles ) -- there s five of them bleating away up there , and collectively they don t even add up to one good singer . who are these girls , anyway ? despite their variegated appearances and hairstyles , they re one indistinguishable pulpy blob . what frightens me the most is that like so many other junk-food culture artifacts aimed at the younger set -- the teenage mutant ninja turtles or the power rangers -- there aren t any real individuals in the group . there s just this kind of amorphous , composite personality that they pass around between them , like the three crones in greek legend who all shared one eye . i hate reading a great deal into pop-culture phenomena , but if the spice girls send a message of any kind , it s twofold : that it s better to subordinate your personality to a premanufactured group identity , and that trash not only sells , but aggressively seeks its own level . santayana once bemoaned america s love affair with trash , and he noted that it wasn t the trash that bothered him , but the love . he film s most telling moment : immediately after a performance , someone tells the girls , " that was perfect -- without actually being any good . " imagine that . a moment of genuine insight , in the middle of this movie . maybe there is a god . '
negativeC,' perhaps if the impostors didn t have so much going for it , it wouldn t have been such a tremendous disappointment . written , directed , and produced by one of its two stars , stanley tucci , whose last picture was the indie smash hit , big night , the impostors almost never catches fire . sputtering like a two-day old campfire , the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed . the film s other star , oliver platt , was hilarious as the senator s aide in bulworth . the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent , including woody allen , steve buscemi , hope davis , alfred molina , campbell scott , lili taylor and tony shalhoub . all are wasted save allen , who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes . ( the audience will easily identify with allen s sentiments . ) with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter . the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it . the plot for the movie involves two starving actors , maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci ) , who accidentally end up on a cruise ship . in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina ) , who is chasing them , they dress up as ship s stewards . the over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer . when the leads hide from their pursuers , arthur covers maurice s mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze . at other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms . with the film s chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce . the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having . too bad they weren t more concerned with the audience s potential enjoyment . the jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground . one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film s dailies . surely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing . it is tricky having good actors play bad ones , but , if they couldn t pull it off , they should have just given up . " the show is over for this fella , " steve buscemi s character says towards the end . the mystery is why they didn t all give up in the beginning . there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast . the impostors runs 1 : 42 . it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up . email : steve . rhodes@internetreviews . com web : www . internetreviews . com '
negativeC,' directed by : william friedkin written by : james webb and stephen gaghan cast : samuel l . jackson , ben kingsley , tommy lee jones , guy pearce mpaa : rated r for scenes of war violence , and for language . runtime : usa : 128 as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn t loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions . this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) . they fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges  life by shooting an unarmed pow . that s against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances . certainly hodges is not complaining . years pass . hodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer . childers , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould . because of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops . childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command . after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd . more than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down . childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians . he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film . did childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ? or are there simply no rules in war ? the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions . the murder of 83 " innocent civilians " has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? where is the u . n . ? the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? this film ( in a way akin to films such as " a few good men " ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism . these accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair . what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking . one of the earliest apparent problems with  rules of engagement  is its lack of credibility . the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed . a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality . that is precisely why it s not offensive . it is completely unobjective . many stories are started and never finished . many questions are asked , but never answered . a lot of parallels are referring to nothing . it seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film . is it about arab mentality ? america s foreign policies ? america s role in the world ? corruption in the higher circles ? it goes on and on . it consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot . it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one . i think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin s probably most acclaimed film was " the exorcist " which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film . in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film . though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage . i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed . it s obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe . the characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict . even the actors can not save this film from going under . though both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of . they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back . jackson is gray and jones uninteresting . the rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks . the time has come for the verdict . on the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty . on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty . but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty , because of it s inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere , not only when concerning the arab population . i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far , portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad-guys . this is very sad , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth . however , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states . and that it s not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east , including yemen are on constant maximum alert .

negativeC,' by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! regardless of what i say about knock off , you can t grasp its awfulness from my words . you have to see it and experience it for yourself . here s the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so . yes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . in fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story . don t get me wrong : i m not excusing knock off . it reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it s so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was . it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme . it does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . as i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness . now , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn t , but it s still a fascinating kind of mess . i don t like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i m off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . for the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing . i paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) . i don t know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film . ray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there s no problem . rob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film . lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! in fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do . in that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense . but what a strange mess it is . it was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours . can this be the same man ? i don t see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . knock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there s no semblance here . for instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he s running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . why ? who knows . what are the implications of this ? i have no idea . most action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . knock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . the acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . sorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . van damme is bad , but he s charming in that bad way , and so i can t say that he s hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . the only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . they re all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe . but his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed . lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes  first encounter with the rochon character . but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ? i hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought . knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania . if it were boring , i d give it zero stars . but it s not boring : it s loud and excessive and completely incoherent . it s also funny , even when it isn t meaning to be funny . a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn t deserve to be fully lambasted . i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness , but i can t deny it s zany , useless charm . oh , i know , they re just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they re fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts . it s fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn t excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful .

negativeC,' an attempt at florida film noir , palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels . it s slow moving , uninvolving , and plain just uninteresting . harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is an ex-newspaper man , just out of jail after being framed for a crime . his luck hasn t been the best , but things are looking up when a mysterious woman , rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , approaches him with a proposition . she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter , odette ( chloe sevigny ) , pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get $500 , 000 out of her stingy , but rich , husband felix ( rolf hoppe ) . at first , all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone , and to collect the money ( of which he gets to keep 10% ) . but , as the deed is carried out , things are not what they seem , and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm . palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film , but the effect never quite comes together . it s got the sultry florida heat , seductive women , and even curvier plot twists , but the whole thing smells of paint-by-numbers . sure , the right ingredients are there , but the end result is much too artificial . a lot of the problems lie with the script , which , though providing some genuine surprises , is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations . even the plot twists don t seem to flow well with the rest of the story . some of them , for example , come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist ( for example : harry s spontaneous job offer , or the whole typewriter situation ) . the characters are mostly lifeless , played to type , but not much more . woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick-headedness that it s hard to even picture him as an ex-journalist . elisabeth shue vamps it up , but doesn t add anything special to the role . chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance , trying to be a sexy 17-year old , but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth . some of the supporting cast ( notably gina gershon and michael rapaport ) give stronger , but , in the end , meaningless performances . and to top it off , the pacing of the film is much too slow . as the movie grinds to a halt , you re given too much time to wonder why you re wasting it watching palmetto . if you re in the mood for this type of movie , you d be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir .

negativeC,' i must say that i wanted very much to enjoy welcome to the dollhouse . i d watched the trailer and laughed hysterically at each line . however , in its full theatrical version , this film is a complete failure . dollhouse definitely has its moments , but mostly this film spent its time flip-flopping between attempts to be satirical and poignant--often failing . writer/director , todd solondz , unfortunately has no ability to pleasantly mix the two sides it seemed he wanted to express . the impression i had of the writing was that the draft used wasn t very far from the first one . everything was presented as is , there was not one ounce of subtlety . dawn weiner , the young girl who s life is pure torment , at one point calls a bully a retard . later , the bully , brandon , takes dawn to a junk yard where he plans to rape her . instead , he tells her that his brother is retarded , implies his feeling were hurt and they start a relationship . as written , this scene was pulled off in the worst way possible because it suffered severely from clichi-itis . brandon s character steps up to the fence , into close-up and makes his declaration , " . . . he s not in any grade , he s retarded . " todd solondz assumes we ll start to feel brandon s pain , however the scene is too contrived toward that expectation and it proves that solondz thinks an audience will react to  sad scenes  like damned , pre-programmed machines . as a director , mr . solondz is rarely competent . too often do we watch actors move for the camera . as in the scene i described earlier when brandon walks to a close-up by the fence . this technique kills any possible sense of reality within the performances because we are too aware of their staging . i have long been of the opinion that actors are not a tool to serve the camera , but the camera is the tool to capture the actors  performances and even to add to it . all to often , i think , directors stage their actors in service to  the shot  when they should be doing the opposite . a great example of this is glengarry glen ross . if you watch , you ll notice that director james foley is moving his camera , not his actors , for effect . the performances in the film are usually pretty good with a few exceptions and there s really not much to say here other than a few of the actors deserve the attention this film will bring--specifically dawn weiner , her mother , her brother , her sister and even steve rogers . lastly , there was a moment in the film where dawn goes to new york to find her little sister . she goes to sleep and suddenly wakes up to see a man running down the street with her sister screaming under his arm . i remember thinking at that point that because this film had already lost all integrity , this dream sequence actually did tricked you only because something this ridiculously inept was possible within welcome to the dollhouse . and it is for reasons like this that i think todd solondz did a horrible job as both writer and director . he seemed desperate to shake our views of teenage life--to be an iconoclast--but fell into clichi , which i despise . this film won best picture at the sundance film festival and like the brothers mcmullen last year , they both proved that independent filmmakers can make films as cliched as hollywood can .

" his maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script , for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make . granted , mike judge , writer-director of the workplace satire office space isn t exactly an amateur ( his most infamous work , the mtv series " beavis and butt-head " was pure gold for its network ) . but unfailingly , judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground . the iffiness in judge s plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal . in fact , based on the popularity of scott adams  cartoon " dilbert , " which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood . unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit-length sequences which would be more at home on the set of " saturday night live " rather than a full-length feature . the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space , which feature almost all of the movie s top content ; this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated . other evidence of office space s failure to work are its lack of good jokes . the comedy is marginally funny at best , but not enough to get a packed house of theater-goers to laugh out loud . the material in the movie is on-key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting , and this could partially explain his work here . however , the movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to allow for any excuse . the plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers , headed up by peter gibbons ( ron livingston ) , at a company named initech . after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech , the movie introduces us to two consultants ( john c . mcginley and paul willson ) which are in charge of " downsizing " the company s payroll . when peter and his gang learns of this , as well as the reason behind it -- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh ( gary cole )  s stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall . the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but . a sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer aniston-as-love-interest subplot are all that keep this one together , but it s definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent .

negativeC,' wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions . over black and white drawings , we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange , sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation-induced mutation . the " original " inhabitants of the earth , fairies and elves , return to populate the globe , along with their evil , mutant counterparts . one day ( and i say " one day " not to be trite , but because that s exactly how it happened - no advance notice ) , a fairy queen gives birth to twins , one good and one evil . the twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire . we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology . as unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out . there s a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all . i soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film . once the transition was made from still art to color animation , an entirely different feel takes precedence . rather than the epic saga promised by the narration , we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon . not just the look , mind you , but all the zany sounds like >honk< and >boing< when the characters go jumping around like . . . . well , like cartoon characters . when we see blackwolf , the evil twin wizard , he s pretty much what we expect . the good wizard , avatar , is nothing like he is depicted in the opening . rather than a sagely master , he s more like george burns , complete with stogie in foot . that s right , he holds it between his toes . he doesn t even look the like he did in the black and white drawings . how disappointing . papa smurf and santa claus are serious wisemen compared to this guy . i imagine yoda picks guys like avatar out from between his teeth on weekends . for years , blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined . however , blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis . yup , adolf hitler , the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht . okay , not the real things , but an archival film his minions dug up . projected into the sky for all to see , it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up . before you know it , there are dead elves everywhere . this is just as well . the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn t care about any of them . they re either silly , sappy , or both . the dialog gets much of the credit for this . an example is when avatar nonchalantly says , " well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle . " not very formidable when he s also the guy who says , " this is the biggest bummer of a trip i ve ever been on . " my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can t fight back against the nazi-charged evil . her response is , " they have weapons and technology . we just have love . " suffice to say , the characters are strictly two-dimensional , and we therefore don t expect anything more than the obvious to happen . which it does . the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out , which is anticlimactic and disappointing . please note that it is the action that is unexpected . that it is disappointing is not . the film couldn t settle on a particular mood . it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle . scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity . the dramatics , which seem to occur at random , are overly staged and overly acted , detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned . ralph bakshi , the director , makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film : hitler and the nazis were bad . so who doesn t know this already ? well , maybe children . okay , so you might say that this is a movie for children . it s not . in the scenes where good fights evil , there s a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they re watching a cartoon . so is the film for adults ? if so , we probably don t need to be bashed over the head to get the point . why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ? wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes , and hitler giving speeches . however , we don t see any reason why they should be considered bad . we see no atrocities being committed , not even any real battle footage . there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich , and we re not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place . this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made , since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment . i d like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere , at any time , and we must therefore be vigilant . however , i m not sure if i want to give him that much credit .

he s perhaps a bit chunky , but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty  , which dampens the blow i suppose . rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader ( `the nirto-est of the nitro girls ,   proclaims gordie ) , but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg , `macho man  randy savage and sting ( among others ) . wcw fans are sure to appreciate these . others . . . well , won t . i found merit in david arquette s bountiful energy as gordie , which brings me to my finishing . . . . ahhh . . . . `praise  for the film : in `ready to rumble  , i have discovered something even more annoying than arquette s `at&t  television commercials . now there s a low blow for you .

negativeC,' what do you get when you rip-off good movies like woody allen s bananas and martin scorsese s after hours ? you d think you d get the best of both films . instead you get woo . falling in somewhere between def jam s how to be a player ( which was awful ) and booty call ( which was ok ) , woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing african-americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons . the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours , as wild woman woo ( jada pinkett smith ) goes out on a blind date with straight-laced tim ( tommy davidson ) . mayhem follows them . for some unknown reason ( read : contrived screenplay ) davidson puts up with all of woo s antics for the entire night , which include her destroying his bathroom mirror , stealing things from his house , violently questioning him ( accusing and belittling him actually ) about previous girlfriends , causing a riot in an elegant restaurant , and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn t tolerate . but for the sake of this bad movie ? sure , why not ? there are a few chuckles in the film , the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas . in this case , davidson is running from thugs , gets into a subway car as the doors are closing , starts to taunt the thugs , then the doors open back up again . a good joke , but a stolen one . another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams  cameo as himself . movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so , and not one of them has ever been a hit . woo won t be one either . so why was it made ? and more importantly , isn t there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive ? everyone involved should really reconsider their careers at this point .

negativeC,' if there is one universal rule in hollywood , it is that all successful movies will have a horde of clones following close behind . such is the case with " i know what you did last summer " . a cheap , predictable , pathetic excuse for a slasher movie , it tries to follow in the footsteps of wes craven s highly entertaining " scream " with disasterous results . four teenagers celebrate their graduation from high school in typical teen age fashion . they drive to the beach , get drunk , and head back only to hit someone on the road . they then choose to dump the body in the sea , make a pact never to mention it again , and go on with their happy little lives . a year later , they begin receiving threats and are eventually attacked by someone who claims to know what they did the previous year . i m going to keep the rest of this review very short , because i don t want to go off on a two hour rant about how awful this movie was . first , let me point out how completely devoid of anything resembling a scare this film was . second , if there is one thing i simply cannot stand it is long chase scenes which drag on for at least twenty minutes only to end in the exact way we knew they were going to before they started . third , and final , i m not going to reveal who the killer is , but if i were to tell you , it would hardly be classified as a spoiler since the character is only introduced at that point . the only reason i gave this piece of garbage an extra half star is because of the performances of the two female leads . they both try valiantly to add something to this pitiful excuse for a horror movie , and i commend them for their effort . do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one . i give it a measly star and a half . * * * * * - one of the greatest movies ever , see it now . * * * * - great flick . try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie , hits and misses . * * - pretty bad . see it if you ve got nothing better to do . * - one of the worst movies ever . see it only if you enjoy pain . e-mail with comments at : jabii@aol . com '
negativeC,' directed by troy miller . cast : joseph cross , michael keaton , kelly preston , mark addy , henry rollins , andrew lawrence . 1998 - 95 minutes . rated pg ( for sexual situations , mild profanity , and mature themes ) . reviewed december 13 , 1998 . by dustin putman  "  dustin putman s film reviews  " http : //members . aol . com/filmfan16/index . html " jack frost , " is one of those dumb , corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film , but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching . this does not come as a surprise , since the studio that made it is warner brothers , who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other . jack frost ( michael keaton ) is a struggling middle-aged rock musician who loves his wife , gabby ( kelly preston ) , and 11-year-old son , charlie ( joseph cross ) , but doesn t spend nearly enough time with them . when he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play , he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas . halfway there , jack has second thoughts , but on his way back home , is in a car accident and dies . switch forward a year , christmas is approaching once again , and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack s death . when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died , the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack s spirit . jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him , but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise . " frosty the snowman , " is a classic cartoon , and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated , but as a live-action film , it doesn t work at all . after a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established , " jack frost , " quickly goes downhill , especially once the snowman comes into play . since jack has been deceased for a whole year , you would think there would be many questions to ask him , such as , " what happens after you die ? " or , " how does it feel to be a snowman ? " but instead , the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie . the performances are respectable enough , but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this . michael keaton at least got off easy , since he disappears after the first twenty minutes , but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here ? i have always liked kelly preston . she is clearly a talented , charismatic actress , but has never been given a good role in her life , usually having to settle for a one-dimensional supporting character , as in , 1997 s , " nothing to lose , " and , " addicted to love . " joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast , since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent . in one of the only subplots that actually works , due to its wittiness , henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman . this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side , however , by the tried-and-true main plot at hand , which is the sappy story of a father and son . since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around , i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid , cringe-inducing lines of dialogue . some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father : " you da man , " says charlie . " no , i da snowman , " replies jack . or how about this little zinger , coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out : " snowdad is better than no dad . " do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this ? the snowman , created by john henson s creature shop , is more believable than the snowman from last year s unintentionally hilarious direct-to-video horror flick , also called , " jack frost , " but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects . either way , it was an awful lot of work to go through , just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project . as a seasonal holiday picture , " jack frost , " is pretty much a clunker . a better christmas film from this year is , " i ll be home for christmas . " better yet , my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film , such as , " it s a wonderful life , " " a christmas story , " or , " prancer . " " jack frost , " is an earnest , but severely misguided film , and children , as well as adults , deserve better . i doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent , anyway . '
negativeC,' happy gilmore is one of those movies that you assume was intended as a comedy , but you don t laugh . it s one of the most disquieting films i ve seen -- not because of what it showed , really , but because it assumed that everything it showed would automatically be found funny by its audience . take , for instance , the title character , as played by adam sandler . sandler is one of the most charmless people to ever step in front of a camera . like so many other " comic " actors today , he assumes that if people laugh when someone raises their voice to a roar , people will really fall apart laughing if he raises it to a pavement-splintering bellow . more is not better . happy gilmore is a kid with a hockey fetish and what some counselors would probably call " an anger control issue " . he can t play hockey to save his life , and this enrages him . constantly . then he discovers , quite by accident , that his bad hockey playing translates into great golf playing , and soon he s taking part in a tournament that promises to help pay for his grandmother s back taxes . how interesting is any of this ? not very . it s only made worse by the fact that the one gag in the movie is happy s temper tantrums . if this were a serious movie , it would be something along the lines of cobb : about a dangerous sociopath who is only redeemed by the fact that he can channel his aggression into a socially acceptable form . here , it s a lame clothesline to hang a bunch of extremely uncomfortable scenes masquerading as comedy . here s the thing : take these psycho-behavior scenes out of this movie , like the one where happy smashes a beer bottle and goes after his golf rival , and you d have the pieces for a completely different story -- maybe one of those paul schrader films , like taxi driver or rolling thunder , about tormented loners who take out their anger on the world around them . but instead the same ingredients are used to make a comedy , and the result is ugly and unsavory . why is any of this supposed to be funny ? after the credits rolled , that was the only thing that stayed with me . that and adam sandler s shrill and unlikeable screen persona , who on the basis of this film i won t be interested in seeing ever again .

negativeC,' a review by jeremiah " spassvogel " rickert i ve always been a kevin kline fan , silverado , fish called wanda , pirates of penzance , and even his hamlet on pbs  great performances . the minute i saw the trailer for this film , i resolved to see it . besides the fact that kline starred , it looked like a hilarious film . i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent , however , as i also thought , " wow , if there s this much funny stuff in the trailer , there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film . " ( oops ) i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo ( my name for our local multi-multi-plex . ) the film began . . . . the film concerns an english/drama teacher at a suburban high school , named howard brackett . he loves poetry and great literary works , but his class is more interested in his famous former student , played by matt dillon . ( i d put in his name , but my wife won t let me take notes during a movie and i ve forgotten it . ) they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him . brackett has been engaged to another teacher ( played by joan cusack ) for three years , and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her . the wedding , however , becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual . kline spends most of the first two-thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn t . the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference . his closest friends don t help matters , bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party . there are some genuinely hilarous moments , one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity . kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck , who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out , while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations . the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding . kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows . . . if you want to be surprised , don t read , i am going to reveal the ending . . . . instead of saying " i do " in front of his parents and most of the town , and even some cameras , he says " i m gay . " this is where the movie , in my opinion falls apart . most of the humor in the film had come from kline s insistence that he was straight , while at the same time , loving poetry and being a senstivie guy , dressing well , and occaisionally acting prissy . it reminded me of the " effeminate heterosexual " sketch from saturday night live . it was funny , it was sustainably funny , and kline s performance made it doubly so . however , after the wedding , the film drags on . they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion , but it then gets into the serious side of what he s done . he reconciles with his parents and his friends , some of which had turned on him . there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time , the scene with his mother and her friends , which was hilarious , seemed pointless , and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless . finally , even though i am not catholic , i found the scene with the priest to be condescending . the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship , proclaiming to brackett in the third person , " he s gay . " it got a chuckle from the audience , but i was distracted by it , and began to tire of the film . by the time the wedding had come and gone , i found myself hoping it would be over soon . ( much like this review you are saying ) overall , if i have to quantify it , i say , rising action gets * * * * and climax and falling action gets * 1/2 out of * * * * * . see it in economy time . '
negativeC,' deep impact ( 1998 ) rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language  starring : tea leoni , robert duvall , vanessa redgrave , elijah wood , morgan freeman . ---------------------------------------warning : spoilers are included in this review . . . but it doesn t really make much of a difference . deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 . remember when dante s peak came out in february ? a few months later , volcano was released . the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . well , it s deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition . this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july . of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante s peak . but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film . apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me . to be completely honest , i haven t had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life . volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch . deep impact doesn t just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot . the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters . deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) . a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above . among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) . leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds . he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident . a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again . we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( téa leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc . she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help . luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain " ellie " that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . . that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road . they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) . beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . they announce a plan called " ark , " which is their only hope for survival . a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random . these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won t kill off the entire human race . after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning . jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . it s a shame that nothing else is heartfelt . now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface . the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won t work . director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show " er . " her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film . well , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one . suggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre . much of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off . throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it s that boring . of course , leder isn t all to blame for it . screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time . what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) . chock full of cheesy one liners ( " you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! " ) and stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again . only one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring . and the main plot is so outrageous that you can t figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi . to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . that s right , 80% miss , and 20% hit . scenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic . but the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening . the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that s forgiveable . what isn t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . give me a break , will ya ? and of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth . well , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant . the water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous . cgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks . in fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days . just when we think visual effects can t be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder s direction , which also influences the actors . leder loves to show the actors  faces before and during moments of terror . this reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) . but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . leder likes to flaunt people s fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist . one moment has an astronaut flying off into space . this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person s face while drifting into space . this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled . on another note , leder s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . the pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown . then again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it s obvious it will be emotional . it s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into " feeling " for the characters , but it didn t work for me . but anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . téa leoni ( bad boys , tv s " the naked truth " ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role . her character is made stronger by leoni s presence , and we grow to care for her . robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot . elijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn t had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama ! you are too talented for this stuff ) . vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen . maximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor . morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) . leelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character . a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby . eldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot . crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv s " star trek : the next generation . " seeing her was one of the highlights of the film . overall , a very talented cast virtually wasted . deep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language . this is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever . luckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful . it s a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn t worth much . costing nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience . well , it s not . when the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it .

negativeC,' deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie . this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises , and , being true to its title , being deceptive . but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit . braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute ( renee zellweger ) . their lone suspect is wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker s pocket . however , a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators , as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables . braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives . braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook ( ellen burstyn ) , a local bookie . kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite ( rosanna arquette ) , believing his wife to be unfaithful . the plot is twisty and complex , with lots of lengthy flashbacks , and plenty of surprises . however , there are times when it is needlessly complex , and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost . take a look at l . a . confidential , or the film s more likely inspiration , the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled . the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot . for example , the film tells a few substories ( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender , or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear ) , but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable . there s never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation . they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay . the characters , themselves , are rather pathetic and despicable . not one of them is an ounce sympathetic , and as a result , the labyrinthine plot is all for naught . what does it matter who is guilty of what and why ? writer-directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers  masterwork blood simple , or the wachowski brothers  less worthy bound . but , while they have got the plot twists down cold , they need to work on characterization and dialogue .

negativeC,' some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others , almost as gifted , have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable . as was amply evident after basic instinct , sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon . rejecting her natural abilities , she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type . gloria is her latest disaster . babe ruth didn t quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity , and neither should stone reject what she does best . janeane garofalo , for example , is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone s part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn t do garofalo s comedic roles . gloria , directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes , was not screened in advance for critics , almost always a sign that the studio isn t behind the picture . after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened , it is clear why they held it from the press . it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed . as the story opens , an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement . she s got a bad attitude and a big mouth . she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents , a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast . an annoying child actor named jean-luke figueroa plays a soon-to-be orphan named nicky . just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria s ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam ) , nicky s dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin s operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice . " be a man , " his father lectures him sternly . " don t trust nobody . not no broads . nobody . " most of the film s leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements . add in the movie s almost non-existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing , and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones . lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting . they stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse . ( " say you re my baby , " kevin coos demandingly . " i m not gonna , " gloria pouts back . ) the movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites . the kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared , no matter how many people are after him with guns , trying to kill him . and in one key scene , the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied . gloria , who keeps saying how she hates kids , takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys . think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends ? if you don t know the answer , you may be just the right viewer for this film . you have to say this for stone : she can keep a straight face . when explaining life to a 7-year-old kid , she says with utter seriousness , " you got a lot of love making to make ; you got a lot of boozing to do .

negativeC,' written by : e . max frye ( based on the james hadley chase novel just another sucker ) starring : woody harrelson , elisabeth shue , gina gershon , chloe sevignysynopsis : two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry ( woody harrelson ) - - an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post , tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye , has ill-timed fits of coughing , and fails at everything he does . the story is told from harry s point of view . harry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn t drink . one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea ( elisabeth shue ) , who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesn t smoke . seduced , harry agrees to participate in a money-making scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette ( chloe sevigny ) , the teenage daughter of a rich man . turns out , it s all part of a needless , very puzzling , extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme ( it involves hiring special impersonators ) by two cons in order to fool harry , a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post . when the  kidnapped  odette is found dead , the clues point to harry as the kidnapper/murderer , and the police are hot on harry s trail . harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money . can he get out of this mess ? opinion : palmetto is a long , uninteresting film with all the wrong feel . hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence . this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof . but palmetto is played like a dark , serious , detective noir drama , and watching harry s bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction . there s a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts , buttocks , short skirts , colored painted nails , and women s legs . even when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema , you can always notice the side of elizabeth shue s breast forming a prominent foreground . towards the end , palmetto re-focuses on plot for the grand finale - - a confusing explanation involving impersonators , with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals  confession . if you can imagine  shemp  from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo  lingerie suspense  thriller , that s how out of synch this movie feels .

" quest for camelot " is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it s ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney . there s nothing here that differentiates " quest " from something you d see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage . ( compare kayley and garrett s run-in with the angry ogre to herc s battle with the hydra . i rest my case . ) even the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others . in the end , it s a tie -- they all win . that dragon s comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse . at least fans of the early- 90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel " urkel " white and bronson " balki " pinchot sharing the same footage . a few scenes are nicely realized ( though i m at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don t sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , " quest for camelot "  s most grievous error is its complete lack of personality . and personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way . © 1998 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/ " suggestions , please , for the fourth movie in the series . how about  look who s talking back ,   in which the audience gets its turn ?

" banderas stands confused amidst the chaos , partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animal-skin fashion run amok . he s not the hero - his soulful eyes and lean build don t exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions - and " the thirteenth warrior " wisely doesn t pretend he is , allowing his foreign and physically imposing co-stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough . let the characters interaction sans swords and shields , however , and there s still a struggle - for the audience to follow or even care about the story . it isn t the end until audiences have witnessed a half-baked romance , murky political intrigue , veteran actor omar sharif ( " funny girl " ) dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic " indiana jones and the temple of doom " -esque chase through the villains  underground lair . all this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr . , but the collaboration between " die hard " -helmer mctiernan and " jurrasic park " -creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights , graphic action and unintentionally telling moments . heard during " the thirteenth warrior "  s final scene : a dog whimpering . how appropriate .  © 1999 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/ " it presents as comedy things that are not amusing . if you think this movie is funny , that tells me things about you i don t want to know .

" if jonathan lynn s latest comedy relied simply on jokes of that caliber--and it certainly tries--then it d be an innocuous if rather obvious little film . instead , its failings go much deeper . first off , who hasn t had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre ? if you want to make a pretty penny or two in hollywood nowadays simply write a " comedy " which pairs a robert de niro/james caan/bruce willis type with a billy crystal/hugh grant/matthew perry type and wait for the royalties to roll in . who s next ? jack nicholson and martin short ? it certainly doesn t have to be funny . " the whole nine yards " is not a particularly funny film , but it is borderline offensive . offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldn t think twice about pushing your mother-in-law off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete . that might sound like a funny sight gag , but the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life isn t all that funny to begin with . when the corpse is placed in a car , doused with gasoline , set ablaze and referred to as " barbecue , " it makes you wonder when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end . " the whole nine yards " is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects . rosanna arquette plays a slutty , chain-smoking french canadian who s married to matthew perry s none-too-successful dentist . it s an unflattering role made all the more so by the unflattering outfits--and unflattering situations--into which arquette is thrust . then there s natasha henstridge ( " species " i and ii ) who plays the well-to-do wife of contract killer bruce willis . she gets involved with perry s character when he comes to chicago hoping to negotiate a finder s fee with mob boss yanni gogolack ( kevin pollack , transposing his vs with his ws ) after willis  jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door . henstridge and perry s characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce and demi getting back together . perry might have the charm but he doesn t have the physical attributes of a traditional leading man , especially in close-up . most objectified of the bunch is amanda peet , who turns in a sexually-ripe performance as perry s dental assistant with , it transpires , questionable career goals . peet s gratuitous nude scene proves how low this movie will stoop to keep its audience from dropping off . when " my cousin vinny " is the highpoint of a directorial career including such forgettable films as " clue , " " greedy , " and " sgt . bilko , " you have to wonder if lynn chose the wrong career path . perry s pratfalling goofiness coupled with willis  likable hardness could have had some potential but with no script to work with , and a director who seems to be watching from the wings , their characters run out of gas quickly .

" virus " is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it . besides the lame " monster " , it s chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say , and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into . for example , there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to * negotiate * with the alien ! now , i don t know about you , but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated , i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it . that makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life . finally , " virus " isn t scary . the least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just a little scary . as it is , it s about as frightening as a box of cookies . skip " virus " . if it s a cool monster movie you want , rent the far superior ( and the granddaddy of this genre ) " aliens " .

negativeC,' i ve never written a review for a movie i haven t watched all the way through , but i had to make an exception with powder . i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend s house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house . so i never got to finish the movie and i m sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie . but i can at least get a partial review out of it , because i saw enough to know this one wasn t worth finishing in the first place . the movie centers around a freaky teenager who s spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents  house . when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him ) , social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ? gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he s a different from the other kids . actually , we find out he s different when we first see him , because he s the most pale individual we ve ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever . when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie , the father takes one look at him and says " he s not my son . " obviously . all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago . so the white-faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids . that is , until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him " wear " his spoon ( " you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass . " decisions , decisions . . . ) and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table . so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy , his mother must be sissy spacek s carrie character . and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes , as we find out powder has some sort of super-intelligence ( " your i . q . test went straight off the chart ! " ) and attracts electrical power . this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school ( if he s such a genius already , why would he need a high school education ? ) and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblum s science class . goldblum plugs in a " jacob s ladder " device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powder s chest . but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching , instead of just unplugging the damn thing . i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row ( following hideaway and nine months ) . that s about all i saw before the big fight began and , let me tell you , that was twice as interesting as the movie itself . but like i said , i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization . none of these movies ever handle the subject properly , instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guy s personality , overlooking his personal appearance . i already had the female character picked out ( the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene ) , but i guess i ll never know for sure what happened .

negativeC,' mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect . a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile . however , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie s best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever . jackie chan plays , who else , jackie . this time out , he s a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show . not that it ever makes a difference in the plot . there are only two scenes of him cooking . for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop . it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons . although she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm , shades of broadcast news ? ? ? anyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape . here lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn t anyone realize you can copy a tape ? oh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense . as luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn t you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape . this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie . in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language . however , that doesn t mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie s recent americanized releases . strangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too . whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie s dubbed films . the plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons . but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie s films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread . look , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts . the action is a mixed bag here . there s really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie s films . it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan . the action in the film is neither jackie s best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes . the film s gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting . once or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence . but to slo-mo jackie running ? either this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down . if you ve seen all of jackie s films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy . however , if you re just in the mood for some good action , you d be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop .

negativeC,' 1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject , or , to be precise , same " high concept " . in summer 1994 , that " high concept " was " mad bomber action thriller " . in few weeks , " thrillride of the summer " actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away , so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes . the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland , where gaerity ( tommy lee jones ) , ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material , escapes from prison . he comes to boston , where he accidentally notices jimmy dove ( jeff bridges ) , dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police . few people except gaerity know the dove s violent past , when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence , betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose . gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror , directed specifically at dove s colleagues , friends and relatives . dove , who is just going to retire and start family , now must confront the mad bomber . while speed doesn t even try to bother with plot and characters , using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes , blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story . and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed . badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all . screenplay by john bateer and john rice , barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland , using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama . the plot is , of course , full of implausibilities . the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual , no matter how brilliant he is , can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay . those questions , same as in the case of speed , could be forgotten while the action goes on , but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters . because of them , movie seems a little bit too long , and boring at times . the most annoying element of the film , however , is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber . his acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself . this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive . the film have few bright points , though . some of the action scenes are fine , which should be credited to director stephen hopkins ( predator ii , judgement night ) . and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove s colleague . but , all in all , blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous , yet hardly unforgettable competitor .

negativeC,' i m spoiled . long before i had ever read a single michael crichton novel , i read stanislaw lem , the polish science-fiction writer who has far more to say in one book than crichton has had to say in all of his . the book in question was solaris , a novel about a planet that appears to be a life form unto itself . crichton probably didn t plagarize solaris to write sphere , but it s simply an infinitely inferior book compared to lem s novel . sphere , the movie from said novel , suffers from all the same drawbacks . worse , there has already been a movie made of solaris , by the russian filmmaker andrei tarkovsky , which is haunting and chilling in ways that this film , directed passively by barry levinson as a holding action before wag the dog , cannot even begin to conceive of . the plot : a ways back , a psychologist by the name of norma hoffman ( played by * dustin * hoffman ) , put together a government report on what to do if e . t . comes calling . he named several colleagues of his as members of a " contact team " -- almost jokingly , it seems , but the government gets the last laugh when the team is activated for a mission to the south pacific . sure enough , down on the ocean floor , there are the remains of a spaceship that crashed there -- almost 300 years ago . ( there is one funny moment straight from the book about the maker of the ship s electronics that i will not spoil here . ) what they find is by turns intriguing and idiotic . a pattern gets set up : we get the hint of something that may be an explanation , and then we re forced to discard it and start from absolute scratch . this is annoying . when we finally do understand what the sam hill is going on , it doesn t make any sense -- and the conclusion the movie tries to draw from it is just plain limp . the effects are decent , but they are no more than a light show to support a movie that really isn t about much of anything . i kept harkening back to the abyss , which generated horrible suspense with nothing more than a broken umbilical cable -- or the exploding rivets of das boot . nothing like that holds the attention here . the actors try . they do not get far . samuel jackson is probably the best of the bunch , since he can pretty much survive anything through a show of attitude . sharon stone , who is a better actor than people realize ( see last dance and casino , and the upcoming the mighty ! ) , is totally lost . and dustin hoffman himself does a reprise of the same territory he did with outbreak . no wonder they re content to just drift : the material they re given doesn t afford them a chance to really make their performances matter . so . when do we get a tarkovsky revival ?

negativeC,' " not far from here there s a fence . on the other side of the fence is freedom . that gorilla will never try to get to it . " starring anthony hopkins , cuba gooding jr . , donald sutherland , maura tierney . rated r . instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as " powerful " or " touching " . i have a name for it myself : " gross " . this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the " rebel " threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren t present day moviegoers beyond being " inspired " by something like that ? this is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience s intelligence . instinct s plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison s " psychotics ward " . assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) . caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career . of course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison . and then there s the inevitable " heartless meanie " character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder s mentor . he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell . let s get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way . not good old theo . no , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says " we need to talk about this right now . " this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct s already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it s also the least of its problems . director jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie s promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs . it s not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) . it aims to " inspire " rather than to touch hearts . as yoda would say , inspire it does not . it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie s story . indeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film s plot to another character . this , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence . i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation . i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever . oscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful . his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink . i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling . i love animals , and instinct s prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with . however this movie s execution is completely unacceptable . tone down the violence and this will be a chick flick . ©1999 eugene novikov sent via deja . com http : //www . deja . com/ share what you know . learn what you don t .

negativeC,' okay , let s get thing straight , right up front . if you have been led to believe from the trailers that the story of us is a romantic comedy , you are in for a huge shock . this is a mean , bad , melodramatic horror story about two bickering people . there is little comedy to be had in the entire thing . which is a surprise . this is the man who brought us the masterful comedy when harry met sally . and here we are , with people on couches , talking to the camera about their relationship . same premise , right ? ohhhhhhh noooooo . the story of us can be summed up quite simply : bruce willis and michelle pfeiffer * hate * each other . they spend two hours yelling , cursing , crying , and pouting . then maybe they get back together . the end . great film ? uh , no . proof that people like rob reiner have too much power . when you find yourself spending the whole film trying to read the wine labels in the scenes , you know you re watching something that s going to be remembered as one of the worst films of the year . even the music is annoying  the same acoustic guitar-based eric clapton song is played at least six times .

negativeC,' susan granger s review of " the watcher " ( universal ) just what we need : another lurid , trashy serial killer saga . this time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking-clock cat-and-mouse game with james spader , a burnt-out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd . to taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too . before long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again . in the midst of this murderous frenzy , there s spader s psychologist , played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in " the cell . " writers david elliot , clay ayers and darcy meyers , along with first-time director joe charbanic ( helmer of music videos for reeves  band dogstar ) , dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase , revealing , early on , exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop " need each other to give meaning to our lives . " plus , as reeves explains , " we re all stacked right on top of each other , but we don t notice each other any more . " after that , it s all sound effects and tricky camera-work , along with a muddled , discordant soundtrack . james spader s acting technique can be described as  wooden deadpan  while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone  dude  persona which sometimes works , sometimes doesn t . chris ellis , as spader s self-important colleague , is the only cast member who manages to be convincing . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the watcher " is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 . the real torture is watching it .

negativeC,' little more than an expensive , flashy , and painfully drawn-out season finale , the x files : fight the future has little chance to draw any new fans to the tv show , if this is the best that can be done . the movie opens with agents mulder ( duchovny ) and scully ( anderson ) finding themselves on a new assignment after the closing of the x-files . of course , through a bizarre coincidence , their very first assignment leads them to uncover a conspiracy involving the hiding of bodies of some would-be aliens . the plot turns alternately confusing and ridiculous after that . it s surprising that a tv show which leaves so much to the imagination does so little for it in feature film version . at two hours , x files is really pretty boring . i found myself falling asleep in the especially dull first half , only to be revived later by one thing after another that * just didn t make any sense ! * for example , if the bad guys went to so much trouble to * blow up a building * in order to hide four bodies , why were the bodies recovered in perfect condition ? why does the road the agents follow on gut instinct alone lead directly to the bad guys ? why did a bee wait 24 hours in scully s coat before stinging her ? why does the syndicate want to destroy the world - and if it has the power ( imminently displayed in the film ) , then why don t they just do it ! ? then again , if a vaccine to this destruction exists ( again , displayed in the film ) , then why don t the good guys just release * that * into the world ? well , you won t find any answers to questions like these in the film . in fact , the movie goes a long way toward undoing the mysteries that the tv show has built up over the last five years . if this is a portent for the way things are going to go next season , i m not sure i m interested . still , i am a fan , and there s enough juice to sustain a fan s interest for awhile . it ain t much , but watching scully and mulder inch closer romantically , and seeing some cool special effects is worth the price of admission .

" just when you though you ve seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen , be that insanity or alcoholism , hollywood releases yet another one of those  deep , emotional stories about finding yourself  . .  28 days  is practically a visualization of the usual  meaningful  true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa-meetings . gwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol . for her life was a big party , with no beginning and no end . this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself . her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes . such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west ) , borrowed her sister s ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone s house . this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab . here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption , willpower and commitment . most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party . the film itself feels like a rehab program , whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times . it is a classic cautionary tale . an echo . a big , fat and expensive cliché . a shadow of last year s  girl , interrupted  , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like  the cuckoo s nest  and  trainspotting  . director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors , that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review . for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy . jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation , despair , terror , confusion , loneliness . and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean . isn t that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ? even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park . betty thomas  idea of hell is a cozy , homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11 . it is simply too light , simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously . but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance . that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story . " all you need to do is just say no " , says dr . cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century . and that s how simple it is ! in fact i would rather watch  lost in space  once again , than return to  28 days  . as for acting , it s acceptable , but hardly anything else . for sandra bullock it s an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than  speed  . she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop . dominic west shines as the source of gwenie s devilish temptations , but elizabeth perkins  and steve buscemi s great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters . although intellectually  girl , interrupted  was a greater achievement ,  28 days  is superior in its visual aspect . there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing , but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor . the most important thing is that we ve seen it before and it was a lot better .  clean and sober  ,  only when i laugh  ,  when a man loves a woman  ,  leaving las vegas  and many other stronger films were made about the same issues . so what s the point ? in other words  28 days  doesn t contribute to the moviemaking business on any level . if you re caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you re standing in front of the movie theatre , you might as well go in and watch  28 days  . under all other circumstances stay away , because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost .

" the faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion . there s not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing . drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall . making use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day-style but rather " through the back door . " parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day . the lack of gusto is the movie s major stumbling block . even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they ve been saved by an energetic approach . this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson s ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven-directed scream but couldn t pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer . although he designs the faculty with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive . on that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns . only the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers . perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they d all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la " dawson s creek . " needless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be . there is a moment or two of genuine horror , but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it . in sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off .

" america s sweethearts " has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting " comic relief " charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . crystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . " america s sweethearts " takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . it s a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . by the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . john cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled " time over time , " are far from rosy . while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen s solo films have tanked . to make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a " visionary " who purchased the unabomber s cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . desperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . he enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen s sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . what lee doesn t know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . press junkets are a haven for control freaks . studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . generally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . the next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . every 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression  writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . the " reporters " are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . the junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . for most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . when they do deal with journalists , the " it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters " premise is de-clawed . gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . lee certainly isn t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? hell no  they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . all of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in " america s sweethearts " is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn t matter because any publicity is good publicity . and thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . so what about the cast ? julia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) . catherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . by casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on " comic relief " - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . in supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed " too broad . " seth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with . come to think of it , " little to work with " is the operative phrase for this movie . as a hollywood satire , " america s sweethearts " is toothless . as a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure . such a good cast , such a waste of their efforts . had it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been " much ado about nothing . " '
negativeC,' shining in such classics as willy wonka and the chocolate factory and young frankenstein , gene wilder is easily a big pull for renting a comedy movie . there s just something different ( and funny ) about his voice , his face , and his physical humor . that s how start the revolution without me grabbed me off the comedy shelf , and i m here to help you through not letting that happen to you . philippe ( wilder ) and pierre ( sutherland ) are rich french gentlemen . they have to make some type of agreement on a treaty and are traveling to france to do just that . when they dock , they do battle with a group of homeless pirates ( or something of the sort ) that claude ( wilder again ) and charles ( sutherland again ) are a part of . claude and philippe were separated at birth , the same with pierre and charles . so , naturally , the two get mixed up and are mistaken for the other two . when claude is taken to the king s palace and asked by the king s servant the kill the queen , the two have to escape and are sent into a madcap run around the house ( ? ) avoiding a maniac , a nymphomaniac , ( ? ) and the rest of the king s servants . they somehow start a war with the homeless pirates again that philippe and pierre are now ( unwillingly ) a part of , and they go to battle . i think that i laughed exactly twice in start the revolution without me . the film obviously has some problems , the main one being that wilder ( and the script ) go way over-the-top with the stupid quota on this one . it takes the fact that the twins are mixed up as the film s 100 minute joke . it also doesn t really help seeing what donald sutherland looked like when he was younger either . ( i actually do feel very sorry for him . ) but the worst thing is that the film breaks an alltime rule . any film with orson welles is either good or funny . horribly broken here as he appears for commentry before the film and as part of the film s extremely strange ending . ( that amazingly ends like some film with hair gel and a dog . ) this is a member of the film s that you could see if you enjoy inflicting pain on yourself club ( ftycsiyeipoyc is what i call it , and i do review so many of them . ) so start the revolution without me gets * star . the young-uns : the film contains some sexual references and the end has lots of gun battle . also , some young children may be confused by what is going on . good age : 7 & up '
negativeC,' i m going to keep this one fairly short , folks . in fact , i m not even going to attempt a plot summary because there isn t any plot in " black and white " . james toback , previously responsible for releasing the atrocious " two girls and a guy " on unsuspecting audiences back in 1997 , has created a true piece of garbage here . this is the kind of movie that screams for an nc-17 rating , being filled with fairly explicit sex scenes , constant violence , and more foul language than you hear in any quentin tarantino film . the mpaa rating system is supposed to keep kids from seeing a movie like this , but the theater i saw it in was filled with young high school students . i know it s naive to think that kids won t see a movie like this no matter what kind of rating it has , yet i can t help but think an nc-17 rating would have prevented at least a few kids from attending . first i ll try to cover what i liked about this movie , which shouldn t take too long . there are one or two slightly comical moments , though i can t seem to remember what they involved . that about sums up what i liked about this movie . i don t often award one or five star ratings , but i was very tempted to give only one to this piece of filth . i knew i was in trouble as soon as the film started with a semi-pornographic scene involving two of the main characters ( bijou phillips , power ) and one minor character in a threesome in the middle of the woods . i suppose the purpose of this scene was to convey how messed up these kids are , but it struck me as being present only for shock value . in fact , there are several sex scenes sprinkled throughout " black and white " which enhance the so-called story in no way . i will hand one thing to toback , he pulled in quite a cast . ben stiller , robert downey jr . , brooke shields , claudia schiffer , and the great joe pantoliano all make appearances in this god forsaken movie . stiller ( " there s something about mary " ) plays a gambler ( a somewhat autobiographical decision by toback i think ) who appears very few times and never quite fits in with the rest of the movie . robert downey jr . ( the horrendous " two girls and a guy " ) plays a gay man , who i believe was intended to be humorous but was simply vulgar instead . brooke shields ( " the blue lagoon " ) and claudia schiffer both show up in very minor roles , which distract the audience rather than add anything to the movie . last , but certainly not least , is joe pantoliano ( " the matrix " , " bound " ) , who is completely wasted as a father of two of the young , stupid characters . showing up in a hilariously pointless cameo is mike tyson himself . allow me to now point out the half dozen or so items which make this a horrendous movie . one , half the dialogue is completely unintelligble . the characters banter back and forth , swearing every other word and saying things which no one over the age of fifteen could possibly understand . two , there is no plot to speak of . there are a few subplots involving things like sports gambling and coping with ones identity , but none of these side stories are ever developed . three , i think this was supposed to be a profound look at racism and life in an inner city , but it succeeds only at insulting members of both races . fourth , there is no direction whatsoever . the movie jumps aimlessly from person to person and situation to situation without any idea where it is going . lastly , the film s ending left me with a sick feeling in my stomach . i normally don t give away plot points , but the movie s ending seems to imply that family can triumph over anything by doing things like pulling together to lie and cover up murders . " black and white " runs the longest 98 minutes you ll ever experience . i recommend it to absolutely no one and give it one and a half out of five stars . '
negativeC,' you know you re in big trouble when halfway through a movie you ask yourself , " what would be better ? sitting through the rest of this garbage or receiving a scratch to the retina ? " ultimately , the question is moot , since both are examples of ocular mayhem . the impulse as you sit through dungeons & dragons is to close your eyes , thereby shielding yourself from those atrocious computer-generated zooming up and down gaudily-colored castles and cloud-capped palaces . unfortunately , the sound design is so brutal with those sharp rings as swords clash , glitter dust swirls , and magic spells go whoosh that sleep is not a viable option . consider just this small aspect of the film : why is it that the main characters are dressed like tolkein s rangers but sound like the real world , some gaudy hybrid of conan the barbarian and star wars : episode i ? indeed , it s nearly impossible to look at the young empress savina ( thora birch , american beauty ) without thinking about natalie portman s headdress . say what you will about the george lucas film , portman did manage to appear regal . birch , on the other hand , comes off as a bubble-headed valley girl whose glib talk of equality for everyone would fit comfortably on the stage of a high school beauty contest . in our opening tracking shot across the sea , while dragons fly underfoot , we hear a ponderous voice-over throwing out strange names and places . we haven t been introduced to anyone yet , and i defy the viewer to make sense of it . what we do get is this : the mages are attempting to overthrow the empire of izmer , while the commoners struggle for equal rights . profion ( former academy award winner jeremy irons ) seeks the scepter to control the power of the golden dragons , but we also learn of an equally powerful rod which unites the red dragons . are you with me so far ? there s a quiz afterwards . it s around this time that we meet the two young thieves , ridley ( justin whalin ) and his silly black sidekick , step  n  fetchit ( marlon wayans , requiem for a dream ) . actually , the wayans character is called snails , who will sacrifice anything , even his life if need be , to save massah . spike lee would have a field day with wayans  bug-eyed performance . of course , wayans is bringing it on himself -- he s clearly set up as the white man s burden and is handled as such . his final scene nails the coffin shut on my case . ridley and snails sneak into the inner sanctum of a wizard who has some sort of secret scroll ( another prop ) that the bad guys are after . as the good guys set off on their adventure , they team up with a young magician ( zoe mclellan ) who never actually uses her magic -- she s too busy waiting for the boys to rescue her . since jeremy irons only wants to pick up his paycheck for this film , he sends the sinister damodar ( bruce payne ) in hot pursuit . together , the thieves , the young magician , and a few other trusty sidekicks run through a series of hoops , with the crazy kids wandering through forests and towns , thieves  mazes , and enemy castles . to keep things entertaining , they never let up on their sarcastic repartee , slapping each other high-fives . meanwhile , snails ponders the immortal question , " massah , why do you always get to save the girl while i go after the dwarf ? " riddle me that , batman ! the sorry excuse for a plot builds up to an elaborate , if incomprehensible , dragon war . buildings are smashed , swords are drawn , and the sky runs red with blood ( actually , computer generated clouds that might have been swell in tomb raider but won t be fooling anyone here ) . jeremy irons gets to stand at the top of a tower cackling , contorting his face , and , ultimately , destroying his career with such aplomb that i wonder when he ll work in this town again . is there anything good which can be said about dungeons & dragons ? fans of the role-playing game will be distressed as they see their beloved world contorted into a travesty . those who loved the saturday morning cartoon will wonder why the filmmakers didn t simply use that cute , kid-friendly story as source material . everyone else out there is on their own . just pretend this review is a large iron gate where , written large , are the words abandon hope , all ye who enter here . postscript : there is one good thing i can say about the film , which perhaps will be of little interest to anyone who never saw the wonderful british sci-fi show , doctor who . my boyhood hero , tom baker , who played the good doctor throughout the  70s , makes a cameo appearance in d&d as the lord of the elves . it made me feel good to know that he is still getting work .

negativeC,' ( warner brothers ) running time : 134 minutes ( 2 hours 14 minutes ) starring dustin hoffman , sharon stone , samuel l . jackson directed by barry levinson with his successful books and movies , michael crichton is doing well . with early successes with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 ) , and recent films such as jurassic park ( 1993 ) , his films have been entertaining . however , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere . this $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull , long winded , and a huge disappointment . considering the huge budget , the all star cast , and a story by crichton , sphere is majorly disappointing . the film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors . however , when he arrives , he his told by supervisor barnes ( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft . along with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber . ) they investigate the spaceship , find a massive sphere inside , meet an alien intelligence called jerry , and basically weird crap happens . unfortunately , something went wrong along the way with sphere . the film starts off entertaining enough , but throughout this very long movie , it just gets sillier and sillier . the film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on . the actors and directing don t help , either . hoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie . stone is useless , displaying no emotion , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman . the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson , who s funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere . but he s hardly in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone . the same goes for peter coyote , who hams it up as the officer , but is then killed off halfway through . the director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action . the drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 ) the writing doesn t help much , either . although crichton is great with plots , he s terrible with dialogue , and practically every line in sphere is a dud . the speech is too simple , i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent . practically every line is just stating the obvious . none of it is smart . also , where the hell did the budget go ? the sphere itself is impressive , and there s a few nice special effect shots , but where the $100 million went is anyone s guess . there s a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget . i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would . but the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid . finally , the film has no idea what genre to be . levison can t handle his own plot . it leaps from hokey sci-fi , to horror , and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller . and , of course , the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it s defense , crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . ) it s not all that bad though . the plot is all right , there s a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there s the occasionally interesting bit . but overall , sphere is a big waste of some fine talent , a lot of money , and a potentially good movie . not really worth seeing . overall rating= review by david wilcock '
negativeC,' millennium starts with an incredibly fake model of a boeing 747 skipping the tops of clouds , bumping all over the place . we go to the cockpit , where the crew is drawling atc clearances , and the captain , for some reason , so senile that he s taking orders from his first officer . inexplicably , the airplane has a mid-air with a dc-10 . on the way down , the flight engineer s sent to the back . he returns as promptly , shouting " the passengers are all dead ! " and thus is the crux of the story . kris kristofferson plays the chief investigator for the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) . you know he knows his stuff : he looks unkempt , walks like he has more aches and pains than james gardner , and growls out the smallest line . when he smiles , it looks like his face is going to collapse from the effort . clearly an expert . as he investigates the crash , he discovers various oddities : watches that run backwards , for example . and a " thing " that manages to stun him . spoilers are at the end of this article . the above makes the plot sound pretty interesting , right ? wrong * . this is a * horrible * movie . the pits . pure , un- pretentious , regurgitated crap . the acting sucks . the direction sucks . the production values are non-existent . the special effects are laughable . the dialog is lousy , fake , and contrived . technically , the producers clearly haven t the foggiest idea of how the ntsb works ( kristofferson to press conference : " we ll have our findings for you in a couple of days , just hold your questions " ) . the thing which eventually gets kristofferson in hot water with his bosses in washington is sop for the " real " ntsb . cheryl ladd looks like a high-school girl who s just discovered makeup . suffice it to say that this movie isn t worth seeing . five minutes into it , i seriously debated running out and negotiating a ticket-swap with " the package . " this movie is pure trash . a zero rating ( out of four ) . an utterly forgettable movie , one which i am embarrassed to even admit having spent the time watching . but even worse , since about a quarter of the movie is run * twice * , in the form of an alternative-future flashback . so we get to see the same , horrible acting and implausible situations for * 1/2 the running time of the movie * . in other words , yes , folks , we finally have an sf flick this summer that s worse ( * much * * much * worse ) than star trek v ( makes stv look like academy award material , folks ) . '
negativeC,' my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled " dragnet " reruns off the air . sure , i d seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv . even though " dragnet " is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d . i . , a 50 s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous " blue boy " episode of " dragnet . " for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb s rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d . i . as what would happen if sgt . joe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic . in this election year , i m more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth . the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb s office door and enters . he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up . the " produced and directed by jack webb " card pretty much goes without saying . this is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot . i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d . i . gives us more -- much more . webb s mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up . the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will " personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself . " ( whether the " lace panties " part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered . ) this , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens  life a living hell . for those of you who haven t been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here s a reprint of a typical monologue of his . i can t duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i m talking about . . . " now you listen to me , youngster . someday you ll wake up fighting on a beach and you ll pray to god somebody doesn t get killed because of your foolishness . . . i ve got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you re gonna turn around and i ll be standing right there . " i couldn t write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d . i . ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day s work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice ) . he meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d . i . webb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , " just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? " bogart he ain t . the other d . i . gets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , " he s a damn good d . i . . . . i guess i m just a little jealous . " join the club , we re all jealous of jack webb s way with women , which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene , as webb finds his way to the woman s place of employment , a lingerie store , and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display . " you expect me to talk to you . . . in _here_ ? ! " he exclaims , no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras . the woman goes off to help a customer , leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen . a little girl spots him in the store and demands , " what are you doing in here . . . you re a man , aren t you ? " he doesn t reply , but you know he s thinking in his head , " what an odd species of human -- so small . must be one of those children everyone s been talking about . " this poor girl , scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb , would later swear off the male gender entirely , just one of the many lesbian conversions he s responsible for . the movie doesn t focus too closely on webb s romance , it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie , where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills . after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea , webb asks owens , " was that flea you killed a male or female ? " owens replies , " a male , sir . " webb yells to the platoon , " this ain t the one ! " that such a scene ( along with the rest of the movie ) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment . but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d . i . , but for iwo jima , guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century . webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of owens ) were played by actual marines . someone wanting to parody this movie couldn t do a more comical job than webb did . it makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your wedding day ) that the man had no sense of humor himself . there s a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter . webb bursts in the room and shouts , " what did i tell you about laughing ? ! " to which the private replies , " sir , only nine-year-old girls laugh , sir ! " and let me tell you , i was as happy as a nine-year- old girl while watching this movie . '
negativeC,' sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality . he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict . but , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet s reputation . a stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir s witness , belongs to the latter category . the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york . during one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed . in order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community . emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder . concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover . that isn t easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways . things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) . using peter weir s formula isn t the greatest flaw of this film . even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent . but the worst insult to viewer s audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith . the author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles . role of emily eden , unfortunately , isn t one of them . first of all , she can t pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn t much better . screenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) . but , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community . also , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture . that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time . '
negativeC,' that s exactly how long the movie felt to me . there weren t even nine laughs in nine months . it s a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork . it s not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it s the fact that grant is annoying . not just adam sandler-annoying , we re talking jim carrey-annoying . since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? but , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant s head in joan cusack s lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant s pregnant girlfriend she has " a big pussy , " referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? nine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot . hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . why a child psychologist ? so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : '
negativeC,' i admit it . i thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies . watching him in jingle all the way , i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids . it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg-13 kindergarten cop , but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence , alcohol consumption , burglary , racism and child molestation . and you know they ll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa s elves . he later decks a reindeer . hey , man , why don t you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you re at it ? jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass , it must be funny school of thought . arnold , sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team , and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene . what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can t find a rare toy on christmas eve , and will do anything to get one ? arnold is , of course , one of the parents , a crack salesman who is never there for his son . he races from the office to his son s karate game , only to find out he missed it . and his kid distrusts him because he s never around . ( gee , we haven t seen that in a movie before . ) arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son s affection is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago . so arnold sets out to find a turboman , which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out . let me back up for a minute here -- arnold s kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character , which is unhealthy beyond belief . watches the show , eats the cereal , sleeps on the freakin  turboman sheets . i d try to discourage any further obsession myself , lest any kid seeing this movie think it s a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want . but nooooo , the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade , exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son , who don t recognize him until the last minute . this is a sad movie all the way through , but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store , racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory . most painful to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll . capitalism has produced some pretty evil things ( chia pets ) , but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful . never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( " your cookies are incredible " ) , it s the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it s okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want . maybe that s what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house , but not at mine . visit the movie critic at large homepage at http : //www . missouri . edu/~c667778/movies . html close to 1 , 000 reviews with a comedic flair . . .

negativeC,' cast - ben affleck , gary sinise , charlize theron , dennis farina , james frain , donal logue , danny trejo , clarence williams iii , issac hayes . directed by - john frankenheimer written by - ehren kruger produced by - marty katz , chris moore , bob weinstein ( rating )  motion picture association of america - r ( restricted ) , rated r for strong violence , language and sexuality . running length - 105 minutes distributor - dimension films if this person were alive today , the inventor of the gun might be troubled by the lack of use of them at the proper time in  reindeer games  . while there really are no good guys in this film , how many times have we seen the hollywood cliche of the villains holding someone at gun point while the audience is frustrated that the silly and simple action of pulling the trigger doesn t come at the right time . even when we don t want to see someone get shot in the picture because he or she is the hero , it still smacks of a lack of credibility . the only time i found this acceptable was in the old  batman  t . v . series , where the villains wouldn t or couldn t shoot straight and the dynamic duo was always put into some kind of campy trap from which they always managed to escaped . to roughly quote 1976 s  network  , " no matter how much trouble the hero is in , just look at your watch and you ll know when all will be resolved " . by rights , ben affleck should have died about five times throughout the course of  reindeer games  and while i m not giving away the fact as to whether he lives or dies in the film , the keyword for this film is " duh " ! affleck plays rudy , a convict on the verge of release where , when released , he will meet with a young woman who will help him get his life back on track , supposedly . he s never met her and she s never met him . they met through letters written . but wait ! this is only a smoke screen . rudy passes himself off as his cell mate , a man who was killed in a prison riot who was supposed to meet this woman . while finding the company of women irresistible after getting released , rudy gets more than he bargained for when his new main squeeze ashley ( charlize theron ) , has a supposed brother named gabriel ( gary sinise ) who wants rudy to help him knock over a casino . it seems that rudy s cell mate wrote ashley that he used to work at this casino , run on a native american reservation in michigan , near detroit , and gabriel , thinking this is him , wants instructions on the casino s construction , pattern of security and other tidbits of information that will make the casino heist successful . of course , rudy can only bluff his way through the scam since he isn t the right or real person intended for this crime . the film is so full of plot holes , you could drive a transport truck through its openings and believe me , they try this also ! at one point rudy tries to explain that he isn t the right man and a hand written letter is produced by gabriel so to establish if this is really the right guy , why didn t they just take a sample of rudy s hand writing to see if it s the same guy . rudy also has several chances to contact the police but we see that admitting to the police that he is being held by criminals would be a violation of his parole , therefore landing him back in the slammer . even if this is beyond his control ? several confrontations between the characters are also laughable and the film is full of smug humour and novice plot twists that don t seem exciting , plausible or even remotely entertaining and something is also wrong when the leading man can t get any support from the audience . director john frankenheimer (  the manchurian candidate  ,  birdman of alcatraz   grand prix  ,  black sunday  and more recently  ronin  , directs this film with his usual look of perplexity . the trouble is , that while crafting his vision for this film , he overlooked the flaws in the screenplay by ehren kruger who wrote 1999 s  arlington road  , a crackling thriller about terrorism and  reindeer games  doesn t even look like it s written by the same guy . perhaps the desire to be completely different threw kruger off course and he faltered badly with this film . several other mishaps that make the film somewhat aloof involve rudy trying to make an escape from the casino and getting caught in the wilderness . we see that he has a knack for hot wiring cars . there are plenty around in this scene . why not just hi-jack one and make a run for it . oh , the irony of it . geeeeeesh ! characters played by dennis farina , james frain , donal logue , danny trejo , clarence williams iii , and issac hayes are given no real focus and some of them have major time on screen and this is only an added and unwanted annoyance . john frankenheimer has tried his hand at hack second rate pictures before such as  52 pick-up  ,  the holcroft covenant  and  year of the gun  and had little or no success with them . he is a director capable of so much more but falls into the rut of making movies like  reindeer games  and for a man whose been in the business for 50 years , you d think he d know better . it isn t evident here . perhaps a better name for this film would have been  silly games  .

negativeC,'  directed by greg arraki starring james duval , rachel true , kathleen robertson , ryan phillippe , sarah lassez , christina applegate gregg araki s the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made . so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus ? first of all , some of the reviews were fairly positive . also , the cast , consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars ( including christopher knight , eve plumb , shannen doherty , and david leisure ) was promising . last of all , i wanted to give arraki one more chance . i mean , the guy can t be that untalented , can he ? the answer to that question is three letters long . nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles . since arraki doesn t know how to make anything coherent , it s hard to describe the plot . let s just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend won t make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls . the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star . he turns out to be a nice guy who doesn t care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans . this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming . it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki , and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez . i thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft . he works better with the camera this time around , especially in the early scenes . halfway through the film , i didn t necessarily find myself enjoying the film , but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation . then as the movie went on , arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads , twisted sex games , and alien abductions . it s sad , because he almost actually had some decent material here , but he ruined it with his usual in your face " i m such a renegade maverick filmmaker , look what i can do " attitude . the performances are generally better than in the doom generation , which isn t saying much . at least we don t have to suffer jonathan " i am the most hideous man in america " schaech . we are , however treated to another round of james " i m more wooden than keanu " duval . sarah lassez gives the best performance in the film , and kathleen robertson ( formerly of 90210 and now arraki s wife ) and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess . of the tv star cameos , john ritter is the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist . if i prefer nowhere to the doom generation , it is only in the way that i would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture . maybe greg arraki doesn t want you to like his characters . maybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them . maybe he just wanted to piss me off . if so , he was successful .

negativeC,' the happy bastard s quick movie reviewthe concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really . shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control . sadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there s something about mary and dumb and dumber . since the duo directed and didn t write the script , i can assume that s part of the problem . the story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970 s by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world . his popularity has gone through the roof and he s getting his career off the ground . then , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything . these two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed s abandoned him and he s about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine . forward seventeen years later , where roy has become quite the loser , complete with mechanical hand , torn-up car , and , of course , the occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while . however , he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley , where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid ) , who has quite the bowling arm . with the kid s help , he figures he can be known again , particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno , nevada . of course , the amish kid needs some coaxing , particularly when you consider , well , he s amish . this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy s process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow . finally , the duo get on the road and , along the way , pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel ) . the main problem i had with kingpin wasn t the fact it wasn t funny . in fact , it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it , such as the aformentioned above and roy s explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? ) . but that s just it- scenes . there s a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie , like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex-boyfriend . i mean , was this really necessary ? couldn t have this been handled just a bit wackier ? i mean , this is a comedy , why throw ethics in ? particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle , where hair gel can be easily mistaken ? that really ruined it , however , and that s too bad . the acting is top notch , especially from angel and murray , and the really funny scenes are worth noting . still , if you re going to think dumb , think dumb all the way through , ok ? at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i d still be a little bit irked .

negativeC,' review by lars lindahl ( larsattacks@mail . com ) " double jeopardy " ( 1999 )  tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse . the fugitive ? not quitethis is the plot for double jeopardy , another fugitive copycat without the action , excitement , and good acting that the original had . there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good ; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall , clever huh ? oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband ( bruce greenwood ) who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man . both movies are on video . make the wise choice and pick the fugitive . there are so many flaws in double jeopardy , it is laughable . while serving time in prison , libby parsons ( judd ) discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice . learning that her husband is still alive , she decides to serve her time in prison , find him , retrieve her son , and kill her husband if necessary . when the strict parole officer travis lehman ( jones ) stands in her way , libby decides to break the rules ( who knows why ? ) and continue her plan , despite the fact that if she gets caught , she s going back to jail . director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son . every other scene , we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture . in an action movie like this , valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something . all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend " i miss my son . " nothing more , nothing less . dr . kimble of the fugitive didn t look at one picture of his dead wife , his primary concern was to save himself . libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough . ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their careers , kind of like their doomed co-star tommy lee jones . winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles . people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right . though i don t think he will win another oscar again . the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons . even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer , the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count . burglary , assault , grand theft auto are some of libby s slipups . the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you re innocent of the major crime . hopefully criminals won t use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent . that would just be plain stupid .

negativeC,' great . here i am , writing a review of yet another cheesy , clichéd , ben affleck romantic comedy in which i will probably be flamed by affleck fans , paltrow fans , romantics , teens , and widows . yeah widows . why ? because bounce is the latest in a string of contrived romantic comedies to feature a man falling for a widow whom he helped to make a widow . yeah it s our old friends bob and harvey weinstein , and this time they re capitalizing on plane crashes , public relations companies , alcoholics , and stalkers all in the same wicked stroke . here we have buddy amaral ( affleck ) , just a good-old sweet talking ad rep who happens to give a free first class plane ticket to a guy named greg ( tony goldwyn ) in order to sleep with mimi ( natasha henstridge really , who wouldn t go for that ) ? of course , the plane crashes , and , wouldn t you know it , he happens to rep the airlines . so he does what any person would : he drinks . cut to a year later , and buddy s out of rehab and decides to take step 8 ( contact those you have wronged and make amends ) a little too seriously , and he begins following the widowed abby ( gwyneth paltrow ) , the former wife of greg . finding out that she s a realtor , he fixes it so he rips his own business off to the tune of $100 , 000 , making herself a double commission to boot . grateful as she is , she buys a couple of dodgers tickets and the two head down the eventless path towards true bliss . if this plot thrills you , or makes you coo , " ah , how sweet , " then please go see bounce . now . i m sure you ll enjoy the paint-by-numbers romance . but let s face it , this is not exactly a great flick . in fact , it s downright terrible . in fact , the idea of being romanced by an alcoholic stalker named buddy is a little more silence of the lambs than sliding doors . writer-director don roos s last project , the opposite of sex , was one of the most honest films about homosexual stereotypes in recent years . and i ll give him the benefit of the doubt that he was trying to address issues of honesty and grieving , but this time he crashes and burns like the plush 747 o hare red-eye that makes a fiery farewell . the performances are weak , the script couldn t hold up a toddler , and the emotional value is slightly above that of a couple of valium . sorry , gwen and ben , but even that oh-so-cute non-romance we read about at checkout lines daily can t salvage this wreck .

negativeC,' what s the worst that could happen ? a film review by david n . butterworth copyright 2001 david n . butterworth if you ve been following william fichtner s career ( and there s absolutely no reason why you should have ) , you might have noticed that he s played some rather similar roles over the years . like sully in " the perfect storm " --tough , gruff , and a little bit scary . or law in " albino alligator " --tough , gruff , and little bit scarier . or colonel william sharp in " armageddon , " or dwayne engelman in " strange days , " or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of " pearl harbor , " as the abusive father of danny--here is an actor who gravitates towards tough , gruff , hard-hitting roles . which is why his performance in " what s the worst that could happen ? " is such a shock , such a delight . in the film , fichtner plays a blonde haired , meticulously dressed , overtly effeminate , dog-loving detective . as alex tardio , fichtner s performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it . it borders on offensive but doesn t really manage it . and it borders on clichéd stereotype but doesn t quite succumb to that definition either . in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming , fichtner isn t perfect--you can see him struggling a little at times , concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air , or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal--but he s pretty damned good , and silly , and without question the best thing in the film . in fact , had it not been for fitchner s sudden and bizarre appearance , and his jarring screen presence thereafter , i would have walked out , for " what s the worst that could happen ? " is mesmerizing in its awfulness , a poorly written , haphazardly edited , and totally unfunny ( yes , it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be possible ? ) moviegoing experience . fichtner s performance doesn t exactly save the film , and it s not like i m recommending " what s the worst that could happen ? " solely on the strength of the actor s dramatic turnaround , but his contributions do raise the film s rating from no stars to one-and-a-half . thumbs up to fichtner then , and thumbs down--way , way , down--to everyone else involved in this sorry mess , a movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesn t even warrant discussion .

negativeC,' in the james bond film " diamonds are forever , " tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads . bond s response is that it doesn t really matter , as long as collars and cuffs match . well , collars and cuffs don t match in " the real blonde . " what might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny , meandering comedy on screen . the film , supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business , is wafer thin . it plays like an " ally mcbeal " episode dragged out to the nth degree , replete with a few unnecessary " fantasy " sequences . writer/director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea . it isn t . the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary . matthew modine plays joe , a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent . he s 35 with no agent and no credits since he s too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas . " that s not really acting " he tells his girlfriend of six years , mary ( catherine keener ) , with whom he bickers constantly about sex . but they need the money , so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video . but it s not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike ( played by elizabeth berkley , still trying to jump-start her career after " showgirls " ) . this points out how artificial this whole business is , one supposes . dicillo has referred to " the real blonde " as " off-kilter , but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff . . . " the film , which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere , is remarkably * on * -kilter and , with perhaps the single exception of the always-likable modine ( who s not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks ) , the entire cast is vague and uninteresting . catherine keener , who s appeared in dicillo s previous three films ( including the brilliant " living in oblivion " ) , is at her most annoying in " the real blonde . " look at her closely ; she really can t act at all . her reactions are all wrong , almost always out of sync with her co-stars . she reacts too soon , or too late , to lines and situations . she moves her eyes , or her mouth , far too much . she frowns , she yells , she babbles--she blows chunks . maxwell caulfield plays joe s actor/waiter buddy bob , the one obsessed with dating a " natural " blonde . bob s personality ( not to mention caulfield s acting ability ) parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera " passion crest " --stiff and uninteresting . maybe that s the point . daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title , a soap dish who beds bob both on- and off-camera . hannah looks about fifty in this movie ( she s only 37 ) . why is that ? almost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples . why is that ! ? marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer . kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent . buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink . christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer . and so on . the best parts of the " the real blonde " are the beginning and the end , brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog . there s more depth and sincerity in a single close-up of her expressive face than in the entire film . while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters  lives , the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it s funny .

negativeC,' _reach_the_rock_ ( r )  ) " an intimate , character-driven drama about a troubled youth at a crossroads in his life , " read the press notes for _reach_the_rock_ . i m not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words bear little resemblance to the slow , completely uninvolving bore i saw--at least , it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film . alessandro nivola plays robin fleming , a troubled , directionless 21-year-old who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small town . police sergeant phil quinn ( william sadler ) takes him in , and what ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of sneak-outs and sneak-ins where robin slips out of his jail cell , breaks a window , then returns , all without quinn ever noticing . also added to the pointless proceedings is some would-be humorous shenanigans involving quinn s dimwitted deputy ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend donna ( karen sillas ) . with a half hour ( if even that long ) remaining , director william ryan and writer john hughes ( yes , john hughes of  80s youth films and _home_alone_ ) finally approach something close to a point . turns out robin still pines for his high school sweetheart lise ( brooke langton ) , who has long gone on with her life , and hughes s main concern at long last reveals itself as a tired " live in the present and for the future " message . most moviegoers , however , will likely be asleep by that time . wide awake , however , is the cast , who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy and skill--thus revealing the _real_ purpose behind this listless enterprise : to serve as a series of acting exercises . such a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors , but it leaves audiences with a booby prize .

negativeC,' susan granger s review of " america s sweethearts " ( columbia/sony ) what a waste of a talented cast ! billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it s obvious that they re attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy . the story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone . he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film s once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they ll be so distracted that they won t remember they didn t see the movie or it wasn t what they expected . ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! ) for help , he turns to gwen s personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts ) . but the laughs are few and far-between . crystal s glib , cynical flack isn t wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one-liners . after six months under the care of a depak chopra-like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack s character s too emotionally fragile , lacking the necessary charisma . zeta-jones s vain , narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one-dimensional . only hank azaria , as zeta-jones s much-macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth . basically , we don t like these ego-driven , stereotypical characters , let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements , and joe roth s direction is predictable , formulaic and telegraphic . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " america s sweethearts " is a contrived , shallow 4 . as a screwball satire , it s strictly superficial .

" can t hardly wait " just opts for a big indoor keg party , and a little bit of aimless driving , albeit of the i m-whining-because-i-can t-get-a-girl-i-want brand . we follow many people around , but mostly we trail preston ( ethan embry , of " that thing you do ! " ) , the alienated writer , who s been pining over the homcoming queen , amanda ( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt ) , for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart . now that she s broken up with her football player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , he decides to go to the party with a note he s written declaring his " love " for her in the hopes he ll build up the guts to give it to her . . . even though he s leaving for a multi-week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson ? ) . since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film , and because it s a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after " dick tracy " ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who s humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don t ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile . ugh . the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not " american grafitti " or " dazed and confused , " two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining ) , but to john hughes films of the 80s , most notably " sixteen candles . " the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion . this film forgets to satirize its characters , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes . . . and then says that it s all okay . we can t take this film seriously , nor can we take this as fun , so really what good is it ? but i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too-over-the-top features , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it s like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities . generally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable ) . i actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in " radio days " ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable . . . almost . and , of course , lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise , the one character we could have used some more of , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film . however , the character of denise really doesn t work with the film , when really thought about . she s far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone . she s not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters . she may ruin the film more , but at least when she s on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves " well , at least we ll be entertained . " a couple other things that just don t work : mike s character , who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just doesn t work at all : jenna eflman s uncredited cameo as an angel - just didn t work , but nice try . basically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i m giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we d do . we don t feel for these characters because for most of us , we aren t stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots . the acid test for high school movies is : does it at all capture the feel of what it s portraying ? the answer for this film is no . nice try , though . '
negativeC,' when you ve run out of old tv shows to turn into movies , i guess you try video games . why did i go to see mortal kombat : annihilation ? the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw . this film was a bunch of fighting , yelling , special effects , and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack . the plot is fairly simple : a portal has opened between our world and the " outworld " , allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn ( brian thompson ) to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity . the good guys , led by sorcerer rayden ( james remar ) and human mortal liu kang ( robin shou ) , must take the fight to outworld , where the fate of both worlds will be determined . here s the catch : they must reunite princess katana ( talia soto ) , who s on the good side , with her resurrected mother queen sindel ( musetta vander ) , who s on the bad side , for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity s safety for another generation . how this is supposed to work , i still have no idea , but i liked katana s line , " i knew love would keep us together , " since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh . there are some seriously stupid things in this movie . take , for example , a transportation system which utilizes the " inner winds " , generated by earth s magma flows . you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast . how fast ? as katana says , " you will be moving so fast , it will be as if you are not moving at all . " what ? later , sonya blade ( sandra hess ) goes to find jax ( lynn " red " williams , otherwise known as " saber " on tv s american gladiators ) at a medical research facility on the island of oahu . how do we know this is where she went ? there s a sign on the facility s perimeter fence that reads : medical research facility - oahu , hawaii . remember , this is not a caption , but an actual sign . i guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are . there s a lot of major flipping action , too . the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another . do they land and immediately get into the fighting ? does one of them land first and catch the other off guard ? do they collide in mid-air ? no , apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away . why did they need those metal balls to travel ? everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b . i have to admit , the fight scenes are pretty good , although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires , allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics . the movie s thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly . " ouch " was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one . you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights , not plot , would be the main draw , since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next . it seems that s all there is in this movie . maybe it is . as i had mentioned , the acting is bad . there s not one solid performance in the film , although williams as jax was pretty funny . after a fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling , jax says , " you look good in mud . no , really , you do . " remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously , and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang . brian thompson , who has played good guys , bad guys , and even an alien on tv s the x-files , but always some muscle-bound behemoth , is your average evil demi-god , but it s more the script s fault than his own that he doesn t have anything original to say . the one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and a half . another thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking , blood only appears in one scene . all in all , mortal kombat : annihilation is loud , violent , shallow , and marketed toward kids . hey , just like the video game !

negativeC,' martin lawrence is not funny . for the proof just turn to his newest film , what s the worst that could happen ? -- the answer to its own question if ever there has been one . i don t know how martin lawrence -- the former 1987 star search winner with an arrest record that would make tommy lee envious -- has been able to survive with all of the bad , bad films he has starred in during the past 6 years . [two words : bad boys . -ed . ] big momma s house , blue streak , life , and a thin line between love and hate are all forgettable movies which can be found in quantity on the clearance table at your local video store . but survive he has , and in worst , lawrence is a mediocre eddie murphy stuck playing another jewel thief in another run-of-the-mill studio comedy . worst revolves around a ridiculous cat-and-mouse game between a thief named kevin caffery ( lawrence ) who gets caught burglarizing media conglomerate ceo max fairbanks ( danny devito ) , who in turn steals kevin s lucky ring given to him by his girlfriend . kevin then vows to get the ring back at any cost -- thus setting up numerous comedic situations to follow that play out like a homogenized sitcom . the cast is rounded out with an annoying latino sidekick ( john leguizamo ) , a one-dimensional girlfriend ( carmen ejogo ) who spends half the movie whining about kevin s numerous exploits in retrieving the ring , a super-fly white guy hacker who uses more apple products than jeff goldblum to hack into max s e-mail and surveillance system , and kevin s sharp-tongued mentor ( bernie mac ) -- who deserves much better roles than bit parts in martin lawrence comedies . the comedy plays out like a henny youngman joke . kevin and his cronies break into max s miami penthouse dressed up like arabic princes and steal pac contributions intended for shady senate sub-committee members . kevin calls max on his cell phone -- he answers it during a senate sub-committee hearing ! -- and max then curses at kevin via the television cameras as the sign-language interpreter makes enough obscene gestures to would make the diceman blush . whoa ho ! sam weisman s ( george of the jungle ) direction is lopsided and uninteresting , and the film s pacing is worse than betty white running the boston marathon . the jokes are cheap , predictable , and come solely at the expense of others . every race and lifestyle -- gay , black , german , arabic , and white , to name but a few -- are used as easy targets . danny devito walks through his role as max fairbanks as a mini-gordon gekko crossed with his louie de palma character from taxi . the biggest insult comes in the guise of underrated actor william fichtner -- playing a sexually ambiguous detective dressed up like a 1970 s bowie doll who is trying to nail ( ahem ) max for all of his shady business deals . what s the worse that could happen ? . . . besides the release of this film ? sadly , blue streak 2 is in pre-production , for which lawrence will receive a $20 million dollar paycheck . now , that s bad .

" return to horror high , " wants to be a couple different types of movies at once . the film tells the story of a low-budget horror movie being filmed at the closed-down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before . but what the cast and crew don t know is that a real killer , maybe the same one that was never apprehended , is going into action again . on one level , " return to horror high " is a slasher movie , and it is at this level that it works the best on . watching the film , which was made in 1987 , i couldn t help but take notice that the killer s costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in , " scream , " and " scream 2 . " on another level , the film wants to be a slapstick comedy , and there are many hints of this throughout . unfortunately , most of these jokes fall flat . and the last thing the film wants to be is a " behind-the-scenes " look at an exploitation film being made . the only problem is that , while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made , no cameras are shown filming it , thus making it far more confusing than it had to be . and to top it all off , the " twist " ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever , and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time . there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous , and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through . if you see the film , or have seen it , you ll know what i mean . the premise of " return to horror high , " is admittedly pretty crafty , and i liked the atmosphere of the school , which is where the whole thing takes place . but director froehlich , judging from this movie , is an incompetent director , except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene . well , come to think of it , there is only one scene that is actually scary , and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in . but other than that two-minute distraction , " return to horror high , " is certainly no great shake . note : look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film . and strangely enough , he is the first character to get the ax . . . literally . - copyright 1999 by dustin putman http : //hometown . aol . com/filmfan16/index . html '

negativeC,' it would be easy to miss the point of a film like  hurlyburly  . that is if it had one . i ve been a movie critic for 15 years and i don t think i ve ever seen a more pointless film that rambles on and on and on like a broken record and when it s over , it s no closer to having said anything in its final 10 minutes than in its opening running time of the same length . set in hollywood hills , eddie and mickey ( sean penn and kevin spacey ) play room mates who are successful talent agency executives and are well on their way to becoming major hollywood players . they wallow in all the excesses of classic tinsel town life . snorting cocaine , picking up drifting hookers and bringing them home for wild sex , indulging themselves in the extremes of alcohol . and when it s all said and done , it s real but you won t care one bit . also along for the socially unredeeming ride is phil ( chazz palminteri ) . phil is an ex-con who always wears a leather jacket and tries to pass himself off as the gq end of the movie business . nothing more than a hollywood wannabe , phil wants to be a stuntman and goes on endless cattle calls only to be passed over each time he auditions . quick tempered and having had many different children with many different women , phil is perhaps the most amoral of the bunch and his fate is of little consequence or surprise . others characters in the film are artie ( gary shandling ) . artie is a close friend of eddie and mickey s who pops by for the occasional boys night out and his character is perhaps the most pointless male in the film . the female characters are even more disappointing . meg ryan is bonnie , a stripper with a child who comes to party at the whim of a phone call . robin wright penn is darlene , an actress struggling to make it with more than just her talent and anna paquin is donna , a drifter and air head who looks for her next meal ticket and place to call home around every corner .  hurlyburly  has a companion film in 1998 known as  high art  . this film knew when to listen and when to keep quiet . it displayed the seedy side of big city life , the consequences of drug use , and low morals with polish and a sedated side to its personality .  hurlyburly  is like a car wreck with no chance to breathe , an extremely high decibel level , and a screenplay by david rabe , based on his play , that tries too hard to look like a well written piece of art when it is nothing more than a two hour play on semantics with a calculating sense of the preposterous . director anthony drazan is a slave to the film s screenplay , adding no injection of his own vision and there is a scene in the final third of the film where eddie and darlene have sex and upon leaving the bed , the long arm of a boom mic is visible in a mirror for about thirty seconds ! this really is professional film making ? ! how a cast like this could be coaxed into such a mess is a mystery . despite their energy and convincing styles , i suspect that they wanted to make a film with long takes , limited editing and a chance to put any actor s true test of talent ( the stage ) on celluloid in a filmed stage play that is as desirable to watch as falling into a bottomless pit .

negativeC,' member of the  internet movie critics association  http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/studio/5713/index . html i ll make a prediction right now . kurt russell , whom i admire as an actor in a lot of movies , will win the razzie award for worst actor of 1998 in  soldier  . i read somewhere that russell utters a total of only 68 words in the entire film and to me he spends the rest of the movie looking like a mindless version of frankenstein s monster , one of the living dead and a cyborg all rolled into one . russell gave an excellent performance in 1979 s  elvis  , a television classic that brought him an emmy nomination as best actor . some of his best work can be found in movies such as  breakdown  ,  unlawful entry  ,  backdraft  and  tequila sunrise  . but as an action hero ? russell is too talented for that . his portrayal of the ordinary guy in a lot of films makes his presence work but  soldier  is junk . an unsavory mix of several science fiction films scaled down into one mess . beginning in 1996 , russell is taken from the maternity ward of the hospital he s born at by a secret military attaché that trains him from the cradle to be an unbeatable , unstoppable and pure fighting machine . we see his progression as a soldier at various ages until his training ends at the beginning of manhood when he turns 17 . several more years pass and russell is now around 40 and a new breed of soldier is created and their colonel ( jason issacs ) is arrogantly pleased that his men , he feels , are superior to the men lead by a rather sedate captain ( gary busey ) who is russell s commanding officer . issacs challenges busey to select his best men to take down his most effective new breed of soldier ( jason scott lee ) . russell is one of the men selected and during the hand to hand combat exercise , russell is presumed dead along with a couple of other men but not before he can take out one of the new soldier s eye and scar part of his face . the bodies of the now " obsolete " soldiers are disposed of on a desolate planet but russell turns out not to be dead and upon landing with a large batch of space junk , meets the inhabitants of the desolate waste planet and tries to lead them in the oncoming invasion to be carried out by the deranged colonel responsible for his current fate . the people are taken a back to russell s deadly form of fighting power since their way of life is relatively peaceful and the climax is pay back and revenge in a most ordinary way . director paul anderson (  event horizon  ) has made an real turkey of a movie that cries out as the definition of  empty  if you were to look it up in the dictionary . the film s obligatory violence is meaningless and to a larger extent , no focus is given to create any interesting characters as a contrast to russell s character . what made 1984 s  the terminator  work was the fact that the characters portrayed by linda hamilton and michael biehn were truly human and were a good character contrast to arnold s mechanical elements . trashy and exploiting ,  soldier  will have you asking " what s the point ? " when you leave the theatre . not bad for the testosterone crowd but for the rest of us , this film is an example of too much money spent on a film that s been done a million times before . '

" but " switchback " is an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting . " switchback " opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she s watching . we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while . he is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn t keep him from offering pursuit . lacrosse s most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r . lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man . in a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado . along the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto ) . this tangent isn t a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself . or is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about . in a sense , that s half of the basic problem with " switchback . " for its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we re given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we ll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction . but " switchback " then decides to explicitly reveal the killer s identity at its midpoint , and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense . some of the acting is a burdensome area as well , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves . what is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ? and dennis quaid ? ( that monotone -- stop it ! ) ermey is solid in a supporting role that s more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes  object of affection in " my so-called life " ) is a scene-stealer tried and true . from a material standpoint , " switchback " is pretty empty . but even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote " the fugitive " and " die hard " ) doesn t know what to do , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals . the set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor . still , that s not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond , and more than the movie s look will end up leaving you cold . © 1997 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1 '

" flubber , " as you probably know , is a remake of the disney classic i never saw , " the absent minded professor , " where a , well , absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as " flubber , " you know , flying rubber ? the new one keeps the basic plot , but appears to have added a lot else , like more absent-mindedness on the part of the proffessor , some more villains , and several " show-stopping " moments , like a big rumba with the flubber , and some more elaborate setups , none which really make it any better , but instead make it worse . the basic plot revolves around a college professor , philip brainerd ( robin williams ) , who creates lots and lots of inventions , but is sadly absent minded . in fact , he s forgotten his wedding to the college s president , sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden ) , two times before he forgets it again at the beginning . doesn t this warrant some kind of mental treatment ? anyway , on his wedding day ( the third one ) , he invents the flubber , which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed , but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in " the abyss . " philip believes that this invention , once fully realized , will save his college , which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon/villain , chester hoenicker ( raymond j . barry ) , which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to . through a plot twist , hoenicker s goons , named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check ) , discover it the hard way , and try to steal for hoenicker , who wants it just  cause he s evil enough . a sub-plot involves philip s attempts to win back sara , who s angry at him ( and with good reason ) , but who is being seduced by who is basically philip s belloq , wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald , playing the hysterically suave-yet-unsuave asswhole once again ) . and in another subplot , philip s day-timer robot , weebo ( voiced by the one-and-only jodi benson ) , falls in love with him . yuckity-yuck . what s most pathetic about this film is how dull it is . you don t need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film , which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney , who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry , half-assedly re-mixing classics ( or non-classics ) for distribution to the general public , who sadly eats it all up . earlier in  97 , they released " jungle 2 jungle , " an adaptation of a really awful french film , " un indien dans la ville , " which , yeah , improved over the original , but not by much . disney s in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now , only creatively . in the rush to ship out a film for distribution , disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called " magic . " such scenes as dancing flubber , a flying car , a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber , and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze , delight , or even cause people to laugh . i sat there the entire film stone faced , chuckling perhaps twice , and shaking my head at all the bad jokes . who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ? didn t think so . it doesn t help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable . philip is not a lovable absent minded professory , just a really dumb man being played by robin williams . williams is a brilliant comic actor . . . okay , a brilliant actor in general , but here he s given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something , and other times act sad . those times , he s not bad . but what are we supposed to think of a man who s forgotten his wedding thrice ? maybe it was funny and/or respectable in the 60s . . . i like disney , and i usually enjoy their films , not only animated but live action , and their recent films ( save for " hercules , " which was good , but not great ) have been worse than lackluster , they ve been pathetic . " jungle 2 jungle " is probably the worst film i saw last year . " flubber "  s probably second . what do they need to do ? perhaps create something new . get writers who can write something that s universally entertaining . films like " the parent trap " and " mary poppins " are films that are live action ( or in the latter case a mix of both ) , but even i can still watch them because they re not only written to be magical to children , but to be fun to adults . what s more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn ? and my god , couldn t they have done something else with edie mcclurg ?

negativeC,' director : carl schenkel || screenplay : bayard johnson and j . anderson black || stars : casper van dien ( tarzan ) , jane march ( jane porter ) , steven waddington ( nigel ravens ) || mpaa rating : pg " tarzan and the lost city " is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . not only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . unfortunately , it s not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like " heaven s gate " ( 1980 ) or " ishtar " ( 1987 ) were bad . instead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place . with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? of course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984 s " greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes " ) down to the really bad ( 1981 s " tarzan , the ape man " with bo derek ) . most of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . therefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others . " greystoke " added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even " tarzan , the ape man " at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek s bare breasts . " tarzan and the lost city , " on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . the script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . comic books have better plots than this . the movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer s comedy " george of the jungle . " didn t the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . when the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . however , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa s last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . at first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . once the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . most of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from " raiders of the lost ark " ( 1981 ) to " the goonies " ( 1985 ) . when the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . for instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . instead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . of course , one can t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . not to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city . there is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it s sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? strictly speaking , " tarzan and the lost city " isn t even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien s laughably stiff performance comes real close . this movie proves what " starship troopers " only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . van dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . i also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . waddington makes a decent villain , although he s like a charmless version of belloq from " raiders of the lost ark . " as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess . however , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news . " tarzan and the lost city " is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . so , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short .

" but nobody cares about tradition these days . it s all about adam , played by the shalikar twins who are variously reported as 2 or 2 1/2 years old . it depends , i suppose , from whether you count the age at the start or the end of the filming . accidentally zapped by a special ray , adam becomes larger each time he is exposed to an electromagnetic force field . in stages , he reaches 112 feet--at least that s what the press release says--a world record for a human . the previous champion i could locate was " the amazing colossal man , " only 60 feet tall . the ray s inventor is wayne szalinski , adam s dad . he is once again played by rick moranis as a hyper type and a super high-tech rube goldberg . he looks dim and is inept with simple daily chores . welcome back to the old cliche about the absent-minded professor , the spacey scientist or the intellectual discombobulated by " real " life . ( a lot of strange people are named wayne these days , in movies ) . " honey 2 " is a single-joker , whereas " honey1 " had variety . the spanish saying " if you lie down with babies , you wake up wet " applies here . if your entire movie is about a colossal kid , there s little you can do except follow him with the camera , hope for the best and try to be flexible , fitting whatever baby does to your framework . as adam s size increases so does the movie s yawn quotient . two feeble mini-subplots--wayne s nasty superior , adam s older brother and a babysitter--are of small help . the film does very little with people , context or dialogue . it s all about special effects and adam s " ooh , aah " cuteness . big deal . adam doesn t say much either . a little eve would have been more interesting , since girls seem to develop speech faster . i retained just one nice , throwaway conceit and two good lines . the szalinskis  suburb in desert-surrounded las vegas is called " vista del mar " ( " sea view " ) . the sentences , funny in context , are : " there s no way i m changing those diapers " and " look at that mother ! " the special effects bring modern techniques to the venerable screen genres about gigantic people , animals or prehistoric creatures , whose size was caused by arrested evolution , encounters with aliens , nuclear radiation and such . some of those pictures became classics , like " the lost world " ( 1924 ) or , better yet , " king kong " with all its mythological , freudian or sociological implications . sometimes , as in " the attack of the 50 ft . woman , " the movies dreadful enough to become howls . " honey 2 " is neither campy , droll , or suspenseful . you know that no harm will come to the child , that adam will do only material damage , and that he will get back to regulation size at the end . i heard just one big laugh from the audience , and this from an adult . the many children in the theater were quiet throughout . confused by the sights ? by the technobabble ? overawed ? plain bored ? nowadays even the best special effects seldom impress the public . we take movie magic for granted . it is no longer like earlier periods when giant squids , invisible men or lilliputians took the spectators  breath away and had them asking each other : " how did they do it ? " in the small part of a laboratory watchman is redhead ken tobey , that likable second-shelf actor , who , as kenneth tobey , had his hour of glory when he played the lead in the classic sci-fi horror " the thing " of 1951 . nice to see him again . it s a small bonus for aficionados clutching at straws .

negativeC,' last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . based on the famous 60 s television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . but it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . and co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . i mean , what could possibly go wrong ? the answer is just about everything . wild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . there are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . but the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . at square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . will smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . my guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . he s too much of a joker . i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . the plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . the trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . loveless has taken the country s top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . one such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings . unfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film s plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . most of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . if it s one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it s the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered . kline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . branagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . but even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top . rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . i suppose there s always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint . wild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . perhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith s name stamped on a summer movie . after such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume .

negativeC,' directed by : john ottman written by : silvio horta , paul harris boardman , scott derrickson the events of the first " urban legends " film have become urban legends themselves . the only person still hanging around to talk about them is the security guard , reese ( loretta devine ) . she s now at a different school , but the same thing seems to be happening again . this time , film student amy mayfield ( jennifer morrison ) is making a movie about the killer from the first movie . professor solomon ( hart bochner ) encourages her to proceed , as does her friend and fellow student film director , travis stark ( matthew davis ) . so , gathering a crew of film students , she sets about making her movie . there s just one problem , a real serial killer has started wiping out her cast . amy s theory is that it s another film student who is seeking to kill all competition for the much coveted alfred hitchcock award . the award includes a large sum of cash , and a chance to direct a real motion picture in hollywood . now amy and her friends have to find out who the killer is before she runs out of crew members . could it be graham ( joey lawrence ) , the student making another slasher movie ? or how about toby ( anson mount ) , the slightly off kilter sound guy . of course , the real mystery is to find out if anyone really cares . hah ! sorry , that just slipped out . truth be told , i couldn t help but laugh at this stupid movie . i think i would have lost my mind if i hadn t . " urban legends : final cut " is such a ridiculously stupid movie you ll probably spend half your time staring blankly at the screen , shocked that this thing ever got the green light . i personally stumbled out of the theater searching vainly for something strong to drink . " ulfc " will appeal to one group , those who love mindless , cookie-cutter teen slasher movies . all the rest of us will react with varying degrees of disgust . at first i was actually willing to brush the film off with a two star rating for being yet another stupid , harmless slasher movie . then it did something flat out insulting . the writers had the gall to talk about hitchcock in this film . they dared to compare this piece of garbage to the master in any way ? i think that s punishable by death in some states ( or if it isn t , it certainly should be ) . i can picture the master right now , rolling in his grave at the thought of his name being thrown about in some cheesy teen movie . it s enough to make on violently ill . the cast in " ulfc " is full of your traditional teen movie stars . you know the type , people who are nice to look at but don t have anything even remotely resembling talent . first up is jennifer morrison ( " stir of echoes " ) . comely ? yes . talented ? far from it . she seems to have been educated at the jennifer lopez school for acting , where students are taught that talking softly makes you appear to have acting skills . next we ve got matthew davis , making his first ( and hopefully last ) appearance in a feature film . i think matthew was educated at the freddie prinze school for acting . there they teach students to say little , but occasionally smile slightly at the camera so all the girls in the audience can swoon . he should get a refund , because i didn t hear any girls swooning . the talented anthony anderson ( " me , myself , and irene " ) makes an appearance as the school s film geek , but he has hardly any screen time . he does get one of the film s few truly funny scenes however . the remaining actors fall into the " don t care who they are or what they ve done " category , with the exception of jessica cauffiel ( last seen destroying her boyfriend s car in " road trip " ) . jessica does a great job playing a girl who can t act . take that in whatever context you d like . much as i d like to blame john ottman for this movie i can t . why do i want to blame him ? well , i m more than a little irritated with him for giving up composing ( he composed the great theme to the equally great " the usual suspects " ) so he could direct a movie like this . no , all the blame can rest firmly on the shoulders of the film s three writers ( another bad movie with multiple writers . what is this ? ) . this script is so insipidly stupid it doesn t deserve to be analyzed , but i m going to anyway . first of all , the title makes no sense . granted , the characters are making a movie about the first " urban legends " film , but the killer doesn t kill based on urban legends ( except for the first victim , but that was the movie s only somewhat interesting scene ) . second , the mystery element is terrible . it s painfully obvious who the killer is . i won t say here of course , but if you don t figure it out you must have been asleep ( not that i can blame you for that . wish i d fallen asleep ) . third , the movie is more predictable than - than - i can t even think of a comparison . you know exactly who is going to die from the first ten minutes of the movie . finally , the script borrows from everything . from " the blair witch project " , from ever slasher film ever made , even from " the usual suspects " ( at least there was a scene that had a usual suspects feel to it ) . okay , now that i ve ground another movie into the dirt and spit on it , i guess i should make note of the film s good points ( this won t take long ) . there is one good gore scene for all the gore lovers out there . anthony anderson does have a few funny moments . that about does it . one thing that really shocked me was that we had a serial killer dressed in fencing garb ( or at least the mask ) and we didn t get one " en garde " or " touche " . that just shows lack of ability on the parts of the writers ( hah ! as though everything else didn t ) . the film s score is decent enough , and big surprise , it s by john ottman . " urban legends : final cut " runs 100 minutes , which is about an hour and a half too long . at one point the characters say that the question was asked , " is film more important than life ? " whoever asked that obviously never saw this movie . i recommend " ulfc " to those strange people who love cliche ridden , predictable teen slasher movies , but to no one else . i give the film one and a half out of five stars . oh ! before i forget , the film does contain one legitimate scare : it leaves itself open for a sequel . be afraid , be very afraid . comments ? send to : johnbeachem@dependentfilms . netpast reviews can be found at : http : //www . epinions . com/user-elerad or http : //us . imdb . com/reviewsby ? john + beachem * * * * * - one of the best movies of the year . * * * * - great flick , try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie , hits and misses . * * - pretty bad , see it at your own risk . * - see this one only if you enjoy pain . get your private , free e-mail from msn hotmail at http : //www . hotmail . com .  share information about yourself , create your own public profile at http : //profiles . msn . com .

negativeC,' ( 1996 )  - c : tom arnold , david paymer , rod steiger , rhea perlman . keep in mind that this film is directed by arthur hiller , the man who is the president of the motion picture academy . the man who theoretically should have seen every good movie made since his term of office began . the man who directed the hilarious alan arkin/peter falk comedy " the in-laws " and also such acclaimed films as " love story " and " the hospital " . keep in mind that the film s producer , arnon milchan , has produced some of the best films in the last fifteen years , such as " the king of comedy " , " jfk " , and " falling down " . with such experience , these men know exactly what makes a movie great . which is why it s so shocking that " carpool " is a truly horrible mess . the plot is extremely simple . as a matter of fact , the plot is beyond simple . tom arnold robs a gourmet pastry shop , kidnaps david paymer and takes his minvan , only to discover that paymer was driving the neighborhood kids to school . and for the rest of the film they have to not get caught by the seattle police , who are portrayed as the most inept police force on the planet . what s so troublesome about the film is that it s " pg " . it s meant to be a kids film . but there are things in this film that are completely inappropriate for kids . there are gay jokes , jokes about breast enlargement , young teenage boys grabbing and feeling young teenage girls , and other such things . also , tom arnold is portrayed as a hero and the cops , of course , are idiots . good message for the children . and the worst thing about the film , regardless of what kinds of jokes there are , they just aren t funny , no matter how old you are . the crowd in the theater when i saw the film laughed once , and that was when a kid stuck a gummi bear up his nose . comedy gold to little kids you know . there were one or two lines in the film which i found humorous , but certainly not enough to carry the entire film . there s one ridiculous thing about a scene in the film i d like to comment on ( there are many actually , but i just don t have that kind of time to comment on all of them ) . at one point the " good guys " are at a carnival , fleeing from the bad guys . one of the kids is riding a ferris wheel and someone bumps a lever and the ferris wheel starts to spin dangerously fast . and of course they have to save the kid . now , why would an amusement park ride have a setting on it which would never be used and is certain to cause death ? just a thought . now i need to justify why i saw this film . the only reason i watched it was because my favorite actor , rod steiger , was in it . arthur hiller was smart enough to get an actor he s worked with in the past ( 1976 s " w . c . fields and me " ) and then not smart enough to give him anything to do . he s in the last five minutes of the film and he does a good job as always with what he s given , but it s just not enough . and hiller should be beaten for actually putting steiger in a clown outfit at the end and having him sell doughnuts at a carnival . booooooooooo mr . hiller . at one point in the film , david paymer says to someone " this isn t funny " . mr . paymer , you re exactly right . -- chuck dowling visit chuck s movie reviews at http : //users . southeast . net/~chuckd21/ over 1 , 500 movies rated and/or reviewed ! movie news , box office reports , film related links , and reader s polls and reviews .

negativeC,' one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . after all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . he is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . however , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . it is edgar s ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : " it s only when things are over that they make sense . " whether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . the thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last . only once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it . but don t fret , it will surface again . you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile . but you hold hope for some time . the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . it s only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope . and with speeches like , " i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , " how can you expect to hold anyone s interest ? to godard s credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . the environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them . unfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene . sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . the second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image . you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . steven spielberg is picked on in particular . while i ll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it s still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn t necessarily an admirable storyteller . the days of breathless are no more . '
negativeC,' one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric , " you d better watch out for the skin deep . " i d like to extend the same warning : watch out for skin deep , but whatever you do don t watch skin deep . skin deep is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards . john ritter stars as zach , a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a big-time drinking problem . i never saw edwards  comedy the man who loved women , but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake . you see , to put it mildly , zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets . as the movie opens , zach s wife , alex , catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress  hairdresser . like any sensible wife , alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him . in response , zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking , womanizing , psychotherapy , and self-discovery . if you re turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink , get arrested , have sex , drink , crash his mercedes , have more sex , drink , get arrested again , drink , and sing horrendously at the piano , then skin deep should be right up your alley . skin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters . zach is a rich ,  80s l . a . version of ritter s jack tripper character from " three s company . " like jack , zach is clumsy and inept ; he s the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye . zach is supposed to be charming and charismatic , but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him . consequently , i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis . in fact , when zach crashes his ex-wife s wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying , i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony . to add insult to injury , edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work . for instance , vincent gardenia s talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender . of all the women in the film--and there are many--alyson reed , alone , stands out as zach s wife ; reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role . because we don t care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep , the film s few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail . the comedy in skin deep doesn t fare much better . most of the jokes are dumb , predictable , and sitcomish . about every ten minutes , however , edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sight-gag , the most effective of which involves a pair of " dueling " condoms . overall , the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat . my final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism . zach s excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life , but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain . zach s drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences . if he crashes his mercedes , he gets a new one . if he gets arrested , his lawyer bails him out of jail . if his wife leaves him , she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if he ll clean up his act . the tone in skin deep is all wrong ; edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly , making a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter . perhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or , better yet , michael keaton in clean and sober before making skin deep .

negativeC,' maybe this mission should have been scrubbedthere s a world of difference between artists and technicians . the artist has a vision to create something new . he may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it s something you ve never seen before . a good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it s going to be just a xerox . obviously successful films need both skills . brian de palma is a masterful technician . he s spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock . he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote . aside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead . in de palma s latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick . to tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called " 2001 " . i enjoyed it even more when it was titled " close encounters " . nasa has set its sights for mars . when the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet . they don t do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe . and it s all so boring . there are so many scenes that just don t work , it s difficult to begin . when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from " dune " ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching . error . the most interesting character ( and that s not saying much ) is killed off . error . the alien is laughable . error . the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable . error . there s some nice eyecandy . the face on mars , which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head , looks cool . a three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world . maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic . but there s so much more that feels as if we ve been there before . from " 2001 " , there s the rotating space station , the blinding white room . from " close encounters " , they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens . the list goes on . the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues . even gary sinise and tim robbins can t muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing . no one seems to care about anything that happens . you won t either . the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr . pepper , with a 20 foot tall logo , saves the day . they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film .

negativeC,' a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i ve ever reviewed on paper . i didn t know at the time that i d soon encounter and despise batman & robin , which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer . as directed by joel schumacher ( who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isn t very good at either ) , b & r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion . the plot , which has mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) planning to take over gotham city and then " the vorld " ( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states ) , is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust , partnership , blah , blah , blah . but morals are not the point of this film--topping each bloated , confusing action scene with next one is . the garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls . since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel ? only george clooney comes out on top ; he underplays nicely and pretends like he s in a real movie .

negativeC,' senseless ( r )  ) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian , and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life . alas , moments are simply that , moments , which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its one-joke premise . granted , that one joke is initially amusing . when wayans s darryl witherspoon , an economics major at stratford university , hits some dire financial straits , he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses . after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses , darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm . at this point , the film sounds more like senseful than senseless , but through some turns of the plot , darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once , essentially leaving him--yes--senseless . this sets up some showcase moments for wayans s gift for physical comedy , especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely , hilariously limp . but these gags , and the gag behind the entire movie , quickly grows stale . once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses , instead of exploring any new comic territory , director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness . wayans approaches each go-round with gusto , but by this point he s simply treading water for the rest of the film s unfunny duration . senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn t strive to be anything more than a comic trifle . however , the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity . darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family , and this " serious " angle seems to come from an entirely different movie . unlike wayans s last starring vehicle , the surprisingly effective ( and serious ) the 6th man , the " emotional " content of senseless is forced and unconvincing . any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles--darryl s romance with janice ( tamara taylor ) , a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself , does not generate sparks of any kind . once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros . comes to an end , the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big-screen future ahead of him . but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless , his film career could go the way of his once-promising older brother , damon , who is now set to make his comeback--on television .

" star trek : insurrection , " is a completely unoriginal and cheap-looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996 s " first contact , " which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different . in , " insurrection , " however , it plays like a low-rent episode of the television show , due to the small-scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one-liners rather than excitement . the film was filled with nearly non-stop comedy , and worse yet , most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff . meanwhile , when there were action sequences , they were not at all interesting or inventive , relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very , very slowly . this plot device , which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays , is getting old fast . are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax ? another element of , " star trek , " films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest , but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later . although donna murphy , who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here , is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103-minute running time , alfre woodard was far superior in , " first contact . " she should have returned for this one , but i don t blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie s disappointing and often lifeless screenplay , by michael piller . " star trek : insurrection , " is perhaps the weakest film in the " star trek , " series , although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst , " star trek v : the final frontier . " " insurrection , " is the type of " safe " sequel that will bewilder non-fans , since it is so low-tech compared to most of today s blockbuster action films ( although most of these are honestly not very good , either ) , and should disappoint the loyal trekkies , since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts . on second thought , they probably should have completely thrown the script out . that way , they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness .

negativeC,' ( tv-1993 )  - c : bokeem woodbine , michael biehn , craig wasson . yet another in a long line of " hood " movies , and this one is just as bad as the rest . " strapped " tells us the story of diquan , a teenaged ex-con with a heart made of gold and a mind made of cheese . diquan has a pregnant girlfriend and a steady job as a delivery boy . then , his girlfriend is arrested for selling crack ( for the third time ) and she s facing a long stretch in jail . so , you know , he s got to do whatever it takes to get the bail money for her . this means he s got to sell guns to ten year old kids . any sympathy i might have had for this character was gone after that . then there s " the man " , a white police officer ( biehn ) who wants to help diquan get his girl out of jail if he ll give him information as to who s selling guns on the streets to ten year old kids . of course " whitey " is the bad guy here , wanting to get those guns off the streets and all , sheesh . so anyway , by the end of the film diquan is facing with his toughest decision , should he save his crack dealing girl or should he save his gun selling buddy . instead he cops out and comes up with the most ridiculous solution , which then renders the entire film as being completely pointless . first-time director forest whitaker does an impressive job with the film . it s a very well made movie , except that every ten minutes or so the action is interrupted by a few seconds of the main character jumping up and down while listening to rap music . the problem here is with the script . first , you ve got no one to like here . you keep trying to like biehn s character but the film keeps telling you not to , cause he s " whitey " . and diquan keeps an attitude about him like " yeah ? so what if she was selling crack ? she s pregnant ! let her out ! " also , the whole entire movie is basically slang , and it s very difficult to understand . for example , diquan s heartfelt comments to a friend of his that he sees shoot another kid : " yo man you whacked !

negativeC,' written by nicholas niciphor . directed by alan smithee . starring christopher atkins , amanda peterson , mary frann . rated r ( contains violence , nudity , and profanity ) 90 mins . synopsis : valerie , a high school junior who doesn t look a day under 22 , writes bad poetry , complains about how much she hates school , fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women , chooses him as a pen pal , and plays hooky to see him in court . after a jailbreak , the killer puts on big sunglasses , wears a half-buttoned jacket , and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie . comments : " alan smithee " directed fatal charm , which should have been more appropriately titled " fatal bore " or " fatal crap " . if you find out that a film you re about to see is directed by " alan smithee , " then you should seriously , seriously , seriously consider watching something , anything , else . " alan smithee " is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad . frankly , i d be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the " alan smithee " moniker for this film . where to begin with this painfully poor thriller ? let s start with the acting . it s pretty bad . amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don t ) , even though her performance isn t exactly stellar material . she s also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete . her scenes with valerie s mother , played by mary frann , are a joke . the two look as though they re a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn t understand . christopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm . trying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket . if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn t cut it here . early on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom . outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film . they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever . fatal charm s storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills . the script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with . this suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault . even for the idiots who didn t consider the movie s title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up . so , the audience must wait ( if they haven t already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale . the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an " erotic thriller " . a thriller it isn t , and neither is it particularly erotic . i can t imagine , if someone were in the mood for something " erotic , " that he d be happy after watching this fluff . a few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see , they re supposed to be valerie s fantasies -- how creative ) . on a personal note , i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through . it s no wonder why she hated high school so much . as an instructor of english myself , i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature , a teacher would stoop to reading a student s bad poetry ( of course , it s valerie s ) about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem s inspiration . i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students . fatal charm won t charm anyone , unless there s someone that s charmed by boring , lifeless , insipid , suspenseless thrillers . if you happen upon this turkey , just keep moving on .

negativeC,' in one of the most hyped films of the past decade , armageddon is a mega-bust . a disaster flick that is a disaster on every level . not even bruce willis can save this expensive , incoherent , derivative mess . following in the superior deep impact s heels , armageddon tells the mudding tale of an asteroid the size of texas on a collision course with earth . the film fails to mention how this particular hunk of space rock was detected by nasa , or even the inept script-hole that shows a u . s . spacecraft being obliterated in orbit by a comet shower , followed by the destruction of manhattan . oops . nasa couldn t see that ? i guess when you are billy bob thornton ( playing a nasa official ) , you kinda wonder how such a wonderful actor as yourself is reduced to rubish like armageddon . willis plays harry stamper , " the world s best oil driller , " who is called into action ( just like it die hard , mercury rising , die hard 2 ! ) . i have no idea why harry , and his retarted group of drillers , are called for a job that if failed , would mean the end of life as we know it . i guess it would seem cooler to have a bunch of dudes rescuing us from complete death and destruction than some smart , well-mannered scientist-cume-amercian hero . the dvd of the movie is okay . it contains a trailer , i believe a commentary ( i was so looking forward to taking this disc out of my machine , i didn t notice ) , and some other mumbo jumbo . the soundtrack is wide and good , but , like the cast , this disc is just worthless . '
negativeC,' a movie laced with a good blend of action , comedy , and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet , but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way , creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product . eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters , blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed , minus half of its original duo ( the late john belushi ) and nearly all of its original charm . dan aykroyd reprises his role ( as well as his co-writing credit ) as elwood blues , the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self-proclaimed " mission from god " along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago . as we begin , elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother s death in prison years ago . completely on his own , elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood , only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away . but elwood isn t completely without family . it seems he has a half-brother of sorts - not a real brother mind you , just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo-father curtis ( cab calloway from the first film ) , who has also passed on . despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) to do otherwise , elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band . working as a police commander , cabel chamberlain ( joe morton ) , has an immediate disliking for elwood , who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother s affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet . following elwood around is the lonely orphan buster ( j . evan bonifant ) , who quickly learns to become a mini-elwood . when bartender mighty mack mcteer ( john goodman ) joins the group , the blues brothers band is complete , and once again , the group travels the country , crashing cars , blowing things up , and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock . meanwhile , cab s personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next-to-next-of-kin . from this point , the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between . those hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story . only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours . for those people , it may be worth it , for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting , but when the story does intrude upon the festivities , the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes , musicians turned stiff actors , and the pointless 10-year- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing . appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin , james brown , eric clapton , and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film , but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors . blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really , really love this kind of music , you might kind of , sort of like this movie . many , many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny , and if you don t have a passion for very deep blues/rock , you ll be bored out of your skull . much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd s self-serving vanity project , but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this , none of the excitement is passed on to the audience . and seeing three guys in three-piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long . unfortunately , those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film .

negativeC,' note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . ------------------------------------------------------------- at the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . this highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios  heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio s lack of confidence with the picture . and with good reason . this is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year s case study in style over substance , joel schumacher s much-loathed batman & robin . ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) uma thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . unfortunately , the same can t be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they re on board a sinking ship . at this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . the duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they re no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture s caper-esque plot . when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . if nothing else , it d at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . the story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists  superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it s clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . the avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it s all decidedly uncompelling . mr . connery , who s onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . at least it all looks good . this is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . in particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . there are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . by the time the film s climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . not coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie s remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . it s everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . a crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not .

negativeC,' once upon a time jean-claude van damme was a decent action hero . the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films , boasting his spectacular martial-arts ability . some of these excursions were fun . but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore , with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind-numbing action . and when the action goes sour , what is there left to enjoy ? i ll explain . knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong . marcus ray ( van damme ) , a babe-magnet and stylish dresser , heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner ( rob schneider ) . they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans , seemingly by a mole in the business . i m going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph , so if you want a review devoid of spoilers , skip onto the next one . i m not quite sure who gives a crap , but i ll issue a warning anyhow . tommy is really working with the cia . his boss ( a very hammy and flat paul sorvino ) is the mole , and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons . he even stoops so low to put them into children s toys . if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing , then you probably will enjoy knock off . if you think that this ridiculous set-up couldn t even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing , this might not be your cup of tea . knock off sucks . it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares . it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something , simply because van damme is the star . the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind , the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe , and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe . director tsui hark ( who teamed with van damme in the superior , but still lame-brained double team ) is at the helm , and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot . i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work , but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous . the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence , speeds are altered consistently , and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired . it all sounds very cool . trust me , it isn t . as much as it scars me to say this ( har , har ) , van damme is terrible . sure , he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease . he looks like he s doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan , and his performance is stiff and tired . i hate to say it , but perhaps it s time for mr . van damme to give up his day job . it s really a test of endurance watching knock off . i suppose there s some enjoyment derived from schneider s character , who is extremely annoying , but provides the film s better moments . and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie ? hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter . knock off doesn t even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film , like a handful of van damme s others . no , this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking . and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department , that is certainly not saying much . note to self : avoid universal soldier 2 : the return upon release in august 99 .

negativeC,' lauded as a genius by many , stanley kubrick commands a superlative filmography that includes such critically-acclaimed films as " 2001 : a space odyssey , " " a clockwork orange , " " lolita , " and " dr . strangelove , or : how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb . " now , sadly , he s added " eyes wide shut " to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near-flawless copybook . this much-publicized psycho-sexual tease-a-thon , with its star billing of real-life marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman , is nothing more than one long ( two-and-a-half hours long ) boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut . kubrick , faithless to arthur schnitzler s 1926 novella " dream story , " has confused eroticism with nudity . he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly . he has confused profundity with pretentiousness . in addition , the director has made some strange casting choices , leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out . pollack , the director of such box-office hits as " tootsie " and " out of africa , " is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here he s miserably out of his depth . . . and there isn t much depth to begin with ! unhappily , there s not likely to be a director s cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one . in fact , with the exception of the stark black-and-white credits , snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack , and many , many grainy tracking shots down lavishly-decorated corridors , there s none of kubrick s trademark brilliance in this film .

the obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that s the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature . deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer . in fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was . the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore . not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions . we learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers . i suppose deep rising s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn t do much for me . on the surface , and that s about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) . in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin . the film is not humorous , tense , or exciting . in fact , it s downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron s current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie . is it really necessary to say anything about the plot ? probably not , since it s easy to guess , but i ll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis . the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship . in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there s finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat s pilot , who s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o connor ) , the inept sidekick who s supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the " mastermind " ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation . their goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally-acquired torpedoes . the problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste . aside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there s no one on board . the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles . the cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad s cinque ) . williams , once a " can t miss " prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career . famke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams . given her limited acting abilities , it s likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes . unfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of the picture . meanwhile , kevin j . o connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard . these days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer-generated special effects . this is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action jungle book ) needs to learn . the days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past . now , movie-goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that it s impossible to tell where they end and where " reality " begins . in deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing . unfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn t so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) . even once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won t be the last of its kind . like the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush . and that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying .

negativeC,' director : mick jackson writers : jerome armstrong and billy ray starring : tommy lee jones , anne heche , don cheadle , gaby hoffman , keith david there s a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book " screenwriting made easy . " this is funny the first time just  cause it is , but funnier as the film goes on since it s totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it , outlined it and then wrote this film . it s like they took the sub-genre of the disaster pic , which can be fun and hokey at the same time , and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them : the stupid , eccentric characters . yes , " the poseidon adventure " is crap , but it s fun  cause of all the stupid , eccentric characters . and " earthquake , " my god ! " earthquake " has got to be one of the worst movies of all time , but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold . " volcano " takes a semi-intriguing yet stupendously inane plot ( a volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops . . . only it s in , dare i say it ? l . a ! ! ! ) and then puts no stupid , stereotypical , eccentric characters in it . they re just stupid . and the actors are all good ones . tommy lee jones is great , an oscar winner , and a member of the men in black ( my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer ) . anne heche is a good indy actress . don cheadle stole the disappointing " devil in a blue dress " from denzel s feet . and gaby s one of the few good teenage actors . but they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what s going on . they do their best , god bless them , but they re all lost in the fake magma ( only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he s the greatest part of the film ) . there s no real suspense here  cause you don t care about anyone . i actually was rooting for gaby s character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn t have to keep saving her ( he did it like thirty times ! ) . and there are no interesting sites in l . a . that we see get destroyed . part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever . in " independence day , " the best part ( other than judd hirsch ) was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens . that was cool . watching really fake-looking magma plow down the street is not . okay , so the film s not devoid of merit . as i already stated , don cheadle was great and the cast does their best . and there s this really moronic scene which looks cool . john carrol lynch ( norm from " fargo " ) goes on a subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it . he has one guy who s wounded and could make it . he could throw the guy and jump and still survive . but no ! ! ! he has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava . here s the cool sight : he melts . here s the dumb part of it : he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting . cool sight . no logic . but cool sight . the volcano erupts twice and for some reason , the film ends there . they aren t worried about it eruting again , they just go home to their toppled homes . but to tell the truth , i was glad they didn t go on . i was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended . my god , it was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film . i haven t seen " dante s peak " but i ve heard it s a masterpiece compared to this . if you want to see a cool disaster flick that s inane but interesting , rent " the towering inferno " with steve mcqueen , paul newman , and the schweppervescent o . j . simpson ( he saves a cat ) . if you want to waste your time watching a boring , stupid disaster flick ( literally , it almost grossed half of its budget ) , see this . but i warned you .

( the script by de palma and lost world s david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise . only the latter is achieved . ) cage plays rick santoro , a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money . the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held . with a flashy , bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone , rick is an obnoxious cop who doesn t know when to shut up . spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog , he screams such lines as , " i was made for the sewer , baby ! " actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole . sinise plays kevin dunne , a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy , who has come to watch the fight . but most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess . the plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen  that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers . the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again , sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not . although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie . the movie s outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden . the film takes itself all too seriously . at best , it is a 1940s-style b movie . a little humor would have helped the script some , but a complete rewrite would have been better . and , although i hate to say it , a different director would have been the biggest improvement . snake eyes runs 1 : 39 . it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers . email : steve . rhodes@internetreviews . com web : www . internetreviews . com '

" side of things . all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didn t make me feel any more fulfilled . what was hedwig s relationship with that other member of his band ( with the beard ) ? what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie ? ( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy ? ) what ever happened to the lawsuit ? and more . . . all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat . if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his/her sexuality , then that s one thing , but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie , i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well . i didn t get it . the film s humor also didn t tickle my funny bone either . then again , i ve seen many a film in these art-house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter , while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen . some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added " atmosphere " of a plant called marijuana , and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements , in order to jazz up that experience . but being sober as i was and expecting a coherent , funny , musical with a transsexual twist , i didn t leave the theater very satisfied . i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle , wrapped in metaphors , dramatics and more questions than answers . i will , on the other hand , definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film , john cameron mitchell , who is also the man who wrote , directed and created the play on which this movie is based , and the tunes , which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols , david bowie and the whole 70s glam-rock scene . note : btw , it seems as though pretty much every single " mainstream " critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom ( and thought that it was really funny to boot ! ) , so you might want to take that into consideration yourself . but having said that , the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the " official " critics , while i , a regular " joblo " in the audience , just wouldn t get what all the fuss was about . this movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews . where s joblo coming from ? moulin rouge ( 8/10 ) - grease ( 8/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - the opposite of sex ( 8/10 ) - dancer in the dark ( 5/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - love s labour s lost ( 8/10 ) '

negativeC,' silent fall has the shreds and shards of a far better movie lurking around inside it somewhere . it takes the form of a psychological thriller , where the detectives work hand-in-glove with psychiatrists to disentangle the mind of a witness to a murder . the witness is an autistic little boy , and there are strong hints that he is probably the killer as well -- after all , they found him swinging the knife while standing over his parent s corpses . richard dreyfuss is the psychiatrist , and it is to his credit that he does the best job he can in a movie of such abysmal silliness . he has one very nice scene where he uses a deck of cards as a metaphor for how to jog the kid s memory . unfortunately , like so many other ham-handed scripts , the metaphor is hammered on again and again until its initial charm collapses . i had high hopes going into this movie . for the most part , psychiatrists get short shrift in films : they get portrayed as soulless technicians ( one flew over the cuckoo s nest ) , or fiendish maniacs ( bad dreams ) , or goofy and ineffectual softies ( amos & andrew ) . dreyfuss plays a fellow with smarts and presence , and he does a decent job of soldiering on while the film collapses around him . john lithgow gets dragged in for a wasteful little cameo as a drug-dispensing doctor , which reminded me of what a good actor he is when he s not in junk like this . the movie has so few real ideas about its alleged subjects that it s distressing . take , for instance , the murder investigation . if you were a cop , would you let the children of the murder victims live in their house while it would still be a crime scene ? the movie s insights into autism are also pretty much nonexistent . autism , like the rest of the movie s conceits with psychology , are just cheap hooks onto which to hang the rest of the plot . and if there is another thriller out there with a more contrived mess of a plot than this one -- write me , i ve got cigars . the film s big climax has dreyfuss getting the kid to re-enact almost on cue what he witnessed . never mind if the people in the movie watching this thought it was believable : did anyone filming it think it was believable ? really ?

negativeC,' there is only so much star power that you can handle . several films base their success on their main star , thinking that they will be a big draw whether or not the film is any good . i think that this must have been what was on the minds of the people who created payback , a new mel gibson thriller that doesnât really thrill . the public seems to trust mel when it comes to making good action movies , after this i wonder if anyone will . what starts out as an ultra-violent revenge movie ends as an ultra-violent revenge movie with not much difference in between . porter ( gibson , whoâs right for the role but canât pull it off ) was betrayed by his partner and his wife when they all stole $135 , 000 . they leave him for dead in a parking lot . but porter is alive and ( depending on your point of view ) well , he plans to seek them out , retrieve his $70 , 000 , and get some good old fashioned revenge . but in order to find the guy , who know works for a drug lord , heâll have to kill a bunch of people and a bunch of people will have to seriously hurt him and all of them do it as if their having fun . somehow , ( i donât really get this ) they must plan the ultimate plan to get away from the two corrupt cops that are following them and escape from an evil guy ( kris kristofferson ) whoâs son they kidnap . will mel gibson die ? or will he overcome the bad guys ? seriously , does anyone not know the answer to those questions ? payback is an example of what is wrong with out culture . the film is extremely violent , but the thing that bothered me is that plenty of that violence didnât seem to be occurring for a reason . another depressing factor of the film was that everything was shot when it was really cloudy or with no light , there isnât one scene in the movie that has an lighting at all . plus lucy liuâs character , a hooker thatâs into s&m isnât interesting even though thereâs several moments where she could be . sheâs basically the only woman in this that kills a lot of people . i also see no reason why the female characters were in this film at all because they didnât bare their chests , which in this type of movie , seems like the only important thing they could do . the film played to me as kind of an old detective story , you can kind of sense gibson doing a humphrey bogart thing as he narrates a lot of the story . but this film is way too much like twilight , starring paul newman , to be any good . female gibson fans will be treated to only a brief glimpse of his chest in the shower , this is definitely a guy movie . so , if your looking to see a bunch of people get killed , punched , have their feet hit with hammers and whips , spanked , and shot , see payback which gets * star . the young-uns : bloody and brutal violence and shooting accompany almost every scene . s&m sex scenes , heavy smoking , and language also occur . good age 17 & up a review by frankie paiva the 12 year-old movie reviewer e-mail me at swpstke@aol . com visit my website at http : //expage . com/page/teenagemoviecritic '
negativeC,' adrenalin : fear the rush ( 1996 ) a " turkey of the week " film review by justin felix copyright 1998 justin felix written and directed by albert pyun starring christopher lambert , natasha henstridge rated r ( contains violence and profanity ) 76 minutes synopsis : a maniac , crazed by virulent microphage , slaughters more than twenty people , including a street gang and heavily-armed troops , with a small knife . even with a handgun , however , he can t take out the two cops who are after him , despite having shot one of them a total of seven times . comments : the most notable aspect of adrenalin : fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge . not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on ( her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible ) , but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses . this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans , but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive , capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles ( though , i admit , it doesn t show in this mess ) . henstridge , just like every other actor in the film , delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey . ( the cast also includes christopher lambert , who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films . ) how on earth this movie got two big-name stars to appear in it is beyond me . adrenalin : fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future ( 2007 ) . boston has changed dramatically in those ten years . it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with " policia " printed on their doors . some guy has a really bad virus , and he s killing people because of it . so , the brave good guys ( lambert and henstridge ) go after him . that s it . 76 minutes never seemed so long . this is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie . the plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert s character and very little about henstridge s character . the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight . a subplot does exist involving henstridge s character s illegal attempt to get her son out of boston . in her opening monologue , a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards , we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son . twenty minutes into the film , i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot . in a defining scene of the movie , however , i changed my mind . this fake passport drops to the ground . lambert s cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away . must not have been a good fake . this emphasizes another fault with the film . things just defy common sense . lambert s cop , for instance , is shot seven times , yet he is still able to talk and slide about . adrenalin : fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn t seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for . i found myself rather bored with this film , which will disappoint both sci-fi/horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert . don t fear the rush . fear the movie . watch something else .

negativeC,' director : richard t . heffron / screenplay : larry cohen ( based on the novel by mickey spillane ) / stars : armand assante ( mike hammer ) , barbara carrera ( dr . charlotte bennett ) , laurene landon ( velda ) , alan king ( charles kalecki ) , geoffrey lewis ( joe butler ) , paul sorvino ( detective pat chambers ) , judson scott ( charles hendricks ) , barry snider ( romero ) , julia barr ( norma childs ) / mpaa rating : r / review : updating of mickey spillane s 1947 novel " i , the jury , " hard-boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am , dresses like don johnson in " miami vice " with less pastels , and has sworn off alcohol . however , he still smokes his lucky strikes , detests all forms of authority , and kills at a whim . beyond that , the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page-turner by spillane , probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers . the movie starts off with a bang : a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series , complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti ( " rocky " ) . after that , the movie and the book begin the same , with the murder of jack williams ( frederick downs ) , a one-armed detective and hammer s best friend . hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack s death , and with the help of his devoted secretary , the blond and shapely velda ( laurene landon ) , and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers ( paul sorvino ) , he is immediately on the killer s trail . here the movie splits completely from the book , and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia , the cia , one of hammer s vietnam vet buddies , and a kinky sex clinic . many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie , but they take on slightly different roles . for instance , charles kalecki ( alan king ) , a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book , turns into a suave mob boss . and , more importantly , hammer s suspicious love interest , charlotte bennett ( barbara carrera ) , morphs from a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic . " i , the jury " is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane s books ( including a 1953 version which was made in 3-d ) , but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way : it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood s production code . although this takes the 1982 version of " i , the jury " closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book . rest assured , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity , but it is thoroughly violent , especially toward women . it features one woman having her neck slashed , a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia ( judson scott ) , and another woman shot point-blank in the belly by hammer himself . no one would deny that spillane s writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling . it s no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor . " i , the jury " had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn t do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made . the script was written by larry cohen , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies , like " it s alive " ( 1974 ) and its two sequels , " q " ( 1981 ) , and " the stuff " ( 1985 ) . cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director s chair after only a week s worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget . he was quickly replaced by richard t . heffron , who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects . heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent , but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently . it shows in the final product . cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none . he shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull . the movie features numerous car chases , shoot-outs , and stunts , but heffron s background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity , " i , the jury , " takes on the air of a made-for-tv quickie , with no real punch or depth . but the problems in " i , the jury " run deeper than the technical . the central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties . because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer s character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona . we never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don t have hammer in them at all . consequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane s storytelling is lost . the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer s moral code is thrown to the wind . despite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code . the title itself , " i , the jury , " refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law . unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment . in this way , he can be seen as " above the law , " but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality . the movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society s terms , but in any terms , especially his own . if anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful . maybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer s character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie . the blame for hammer s character can t be laid on assante s shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance . spillane never once described hammer s physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him . of course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane s books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963 s " the girl hunters , " is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) . the rest of actors are most un-noteworthy . with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino , everyone who appeared in " i , the jury " were up-and-comers who basically went nowhere . many of them ended up working in television ( like carrera , who had a short stint on " dallas " in the mid-eighties ) , which only adds to the made-for-tv atmosphere of the film . maybe someday , someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book , but this is certainly not it .

negativeC,' the u . s . army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done . one particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting . under the " saluting " section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer . the salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail . in any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group . almost at the very beginning of the general s daughter , we see a general s motorcade passing a work detail . everyone salutes . it looked impressive , but it just wasn t right . that little bit showed me that someone either didn t do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene . in fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie . what results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn t right . the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example . paul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army s criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale . prior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn t the unscrupulous supply sergeant he s supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living . so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we ll just say that it involves propellers ) . brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general s daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base s training ranges . he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder . what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary . it gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he s a little cocky . does the arms subplot turn up later ? no , so why add this extra running time to the film ? the answer : it looked cool . or how about the " atmosphere " ? the beginning of the general s daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music . nice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn t matter , for when the film s plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood . no attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme . did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside . the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie . as i ve already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn t jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty . brenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest " yes , sir " s i ve ever heard . he even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general s daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous . sunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity . both characters are protagonists , but it s hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing . i could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , " let s do it again , but this time , i want more . " i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes . an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general s aide , colonel fowler . i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention . a far cry from his days as linc in " the mod squad " , i can t help but think he was acting from west s direction . a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear . the only two actors who seem to have escaped west s influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth s mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people s minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top . hutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn t overacting . i haven t read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i ll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished . every time we re presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it s the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all . instead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead . the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was . would ve been over in a half hour . the film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning . literally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off . they both seem kind of happy . maybe they were driving away from simon west .

" america -- although a film as blindly patriotic as this would never admit it -- already has enough gun-crazed maniacs . their defence for bearing arms is that 1 ) the constitution allows it , and 2 ) they need to do so for home protection . with scenes like the one above , " the patriot " serves as an incitement of those freaks , and also of the pathetic flag-wavers who wear stars-and-stripes shorts at street parades and recite " we really do live in the land of the free and the home of the brave ! " as if paraphrasing a line from one s national anthem is the same thing as seriously examining one s country . " the patriot " is being advertised as the revolutionary war equivalent of gibson s great scottish epic " braveheart " , but it s nowhere near as entertaining , and does a much more methodical job of demonising the british while glamorising a revolt . the narrative essentially consists of gibson and a small band of merry men wandering around the country discussing " the cause " ; although now and again gibson meets up with his family , or there will be another attack from those horrid recoats . of course there is a token black character among gibson s troupe , who gets some racist comments at first , but then apologies , so none of the americans come off looking evil . when the level of the storytelling becomes apparent , we hold out hope that we can at least expect some spectacular sequences of dumb action . but there is hardly any fighting until the climax , when comes a highly implausible battle scene , with gibson running through the bloody lines unharmed , carrying the american flag . then he thrusts it into the ground and has a ridiculous clash with a british officer ( jason isaacs ) , where each man wields two swords in each hand , and juts them at each other in time to swashbuckler music chords . to picture this , recall the jim carrey comedy " cable guy " , with its parody of the famous " star trek " fight . gibson opens every scene with a flustered , confused expression and then turns it into a frown . it s like " braveheart " going senile but sporadically returning to his old self . the dialogue that he and all the other actors have to speak varies from horribly stilted ( " men ! richly fight for the cause about which you spake ! " ; " father . . . this yonder boy be two years younger than i ! " ) to nonsensical ( " i m a parent , i don t have the luxury of principles " ) to lazy and pedestrian ( " daddy , daddy , come back !

" ghosts of mars " is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry . the film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly . carpenter might like to think he s made a western here but it s a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts . it s just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken . i never thought i d miss the guy but i do . it s not * all * the same , however . dubbed the " one-note wonder " for his minimalist music soundtracks , carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic ( yet effective ) scoring by highlighting his action with loud , screeching guitar work . fortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue . the final exchange between henstridge and , er , cube though is both audible * and * priceless . mars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn " mission to mars " and " red planet " ( with val kilmer ) . " ghosts of mars " sadly adds to those disappointing returns ( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels , among them " american pie 2 " and " rush hour 2 " ) . the irony is that the mars in carpenter s film feels sadly absent . there are occasional references to the red planet , of course , but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth s closest neighbor . two things keep " john carpenter s ghosts of mars " from getting a huge slap upside the head . 1 . henstridge keeps her top on ( miraculously ) , and 2 . the film doesn t pretend to be anything it s not . what that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly out of luck .

negativeC,' have you ever known someone who was so detestable that everyone hated him ? imagine if that person was murdered , who would the suspects be , everyone ? now , imagine if someone , we ll just call him nick , were to make a movie entirely about a person like this ; what kind of movie would that be ? apparently , it would be a movie called " drowning mona " , one of the most despicable , mean spirited , evil little movies i have ever seen . the only thing that saved this movie from a one star rating , was the presence of danny devito as the only likable character in a movie filled with abhorrent people . " drowning mona " managed to cause me to stare , slack-jawed and horrified at the screen during its full running time . there aren t too many films out there which can do that . mona dearly ( bette midler ) is an evil , loathsome creature , whose life is filled with caustic remarks and hate-filled glares . her husband , phil ( william fichtner ) , is a depressed looking man who makes it through life only because of the happiness he finds in his affair with rona ( jamie lee curtis ) , a local waitress . then one day mona s brakes fail while driving along a mountain road , and she flies into the river . of course , everyone in the town is suspect : her husband ; her one handed son , jeff ( marcus thomas ) ; his business partner , bobby ( casey affleck ) ; bobby s fiancee , ellen ( neve campbell ) ; and a slew of other people all had plenty of reason to want mona dearly dead . chief wyatt rash ( danny devito ) , the local sheriff , must try to determine who the killer might be out of the hundreds of possible suspects . it s only march , and already a candidate for worst movie of the year has arisen . seldom have i seen a movie audience so silent during a comedy . on those rare occasions where i was able to tear my eyes from the horrors on display , i would glance about to see other audience members staring at the screen with looks of shock plastered on their faces . " drowning mona " is an amazingly evil , twisted movie , which nearly gives " very bad things " a run for its money as most disturbing film of the past five years . not only is the movie evil , but its attempts at actual humor fall completely flat . i think that " drowning mona " was supposed to be a dark , dark comedy , but it succeeds only in being very dark . perhaps most terrifying of all is that the actors involved appeared to be having a grand old time acting like yugo driving demons ( everyone in the film drives a yugo ) . bette midler is amazingly convincing as the queen of this hell on earth , and her fellow stars , particularly marcus thomas ( " palmetto " ) , are very nearly as loathsome . the running gag with thomas involves him having a stump for a left hand ( pretty funny , huh ? ) . thomas s character , jeff , does wonderful things such as run over his neighbor s dog with a lawnmower and hit on a thirteen year old girl . i think this was all supposed to be funny , but if that s the case it failed miserably . devito plays the only fully likeable character here - the sheriff with a heart of gold . the truth is , devito can t help but be great in any moive , no matter how otherwise terrible it might be ( " war of the roses " , for example ) . " drowning mona " is a waste of both talent and time . i wouldn t wish it on anyone except perhaps nick gomez and peter steinfeld for creating this heap of garbage . i ll grant you , the two men must have talent because it takes some to create a film so thoroughly revolting . the film runs 95 minutes , which is about an hour and a half too long . i don t recommend it to anyone , anywhere . if you re really desperate to see bette midler in something new ( and i mean desperate enough that you re going to die without seeing her ) , i d still suggest you wait for video or at least catch a matinee . with any luck , " drowning mona " will be out of theaters in a few weeks . i give this sorry movie one and a half out of five stars . comments ? feel free to e-mail them to : johnbeachem@dependentfilms . net for past reviews , movie news , and other fun stuff , visit : http : //www . dependentfilms . net * * * * * - one of the greatest movies ever made , see it now . * * * * - great flick , try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie , hits and misses . * * - pretty bad , see it only if you ve got nothing better to do . * - one of the worst movies ever made . see it only if you enjoy pain .

negativeC,' movies can do the two big es very well : educate and entertain . in the best of all possible worlds , they accomplish both . on the red planet , they fail entirely . in the near future , a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth . this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be . after some mumbo-jumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet , the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does . the ground crew of people you couldn t care less about is trapped on the surface without food , water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog . the one potentially interesting character ( carrie-anne moss ) spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer . attempting to graft " 2001 " esque space mysticism with " terminator " robot horror , first time director antony hoffman can t seem to figure out what s going on . neither can we . didn t he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was a coherent story ? couldn t he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter ? there are so many mis-steps . every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction . why introduce the theme of faith vs . science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die _offscreen_ ? the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen . two hours later , they re still waiting . despite our greatest hopes , there is no life on the red planet .

negativeC,' new year , new pile of movies straight from the hollywood dumping ground of badly test-screened , obscure , unfunny , and badly acted garbage . double take is the first pony out of the gate . i don t know which is the worst part of the film : eddie griffin s overacting , orlando jones  non-acting , or the ugly mutt that passes as griffin s sidekick . orlando jones does a better job in those 7-up commercials than in the role of darryl chase , an uptight investment banker set up by a combination of the cia , the fbi , a mexican drug cartel , the federales , and an emu farmer as part of a double murder/embezzlement scheme . running from the law , chase changes clothes and identity with freddy tiffany , a two-bit hustler named played by eddie griffin he encounters on the street . together , the pair travel across the country to mexico , where a certain cia agent holds the key to chase s freedom . and of course , during the journey , darryl chase rediscovers his roots as a black man while freddy tiffany shucks and jives his way through every situation like he s the bastard son of eddie murphy and jerry lewis . after numerous car chases , way too many plot " twists , " the aforementioned annoying dog , the bad acting of vivica a . fox , and too many jokes about a glass eye , the movie becomes a science project left in the school refrigerator to rot over the summer . orlando jones , a genuinely talented actor/writer , seems out of place here , annoyed by the film and especially by his costar s lack of acting ability . griffin has the energy of tito puente , the humor of richard pryor , and the acting ability of former seattle seahawks linebacker brian bosworth . jones deserves better material and collaborators . it s a shame that double take is as bad as it is , because this cinematic travesty was written and directed by george gallo , the screenwriter of one of the funniest films of the 1980 s , midnight run ( the plot of which bears a striking similarity to this film ) . here are a few bonus facts to consider if you haven t bought my evaluation : the film is based on an obscure 1950 s english film starring rod steiger called across the bridge . it took more than a decade to get the green light for production . it describes itself as a cross between " film noir , a thriller , and a comedy .

negativeC,' the most imaginative part of mallrats comes with its opening credits , which are blatantly sexual comic book pictures--and that s not too imaginative either . the biggest laugh in mallrats , from an audience of 11-12-year-olds assembled in rows 15 and 16 , came when the two protagonists-buddies consult a fortune teller who bares her top and exhibits three nipples . ( number three , of course , is a fake , but the boys are taken in ) . even then , it was only size 4 or 5 laughter on a scale of 1 to 10 . the view of american youth in mallrats tries to be funny , which it isn t . it might have been a satire of slackers and mall culture but it isn t that either . it s plain dull and just a series of nails in the american coffin . the filmmaker is kevin smith , whose feature writer-director debut was clerks , an original , plotless comedy of people in and around a convenience and a video store . the absurdist , slice-of-life , desultorily conversational and pointedly scatological clerks was a hit , though i had my reservations about it . mallrats , done in the same spirit and with some of the same actors ( smith himself playing silent bob ) , is a flop . it has something of a plot , vague and disjointed . t . s . ( notice the scatology of the name ) ( jeremy london ) has been dumped by his fiancee brandi ( claire forlani ) for reasons too dull to mention . brodie ( jason lee ) , has been dumped by his girl rene ( shannen doherty ) because , in bed , he is more interested in video-games than in sex . ( let s not even talk about love ) . the two men ( men ? ) find solace in doing what any red-blooded idiots will do . they go to the mall . there , a subplot has them trying to sabotage that day s forthcoming game show , a kind of dating game , which is produced by brandi s father , a youthful but bald creep . the movie s comedy is below sitcom level , the dialogue , action and characters are of no interest , except perhaps to people under twenty with a mental age under six . since those people neither read film reviews nor put any credence in adult judgments , mallrats might just have a career , even though it is exceptionally thin and dull in every way . the best that can be said is that , at the mall , smith places a fat young man who stares at a sort of pointillist painting which , looked at with concentration , reveals a sailboat . but the poor fellow stands there and stands there and can t see a thing . not a bad gag , though thoroughly milked . another " funny " item is about a fifteen-year old girl who is presumably so bright that she s a senior . she is writing a book about orgasms and researches by sleeping with men right and left and videotaping the activities . her language is raunchy even by kevin smith standards , standards that use the alphabet from the a-word to perhaps some z-word , though the n-word is not heard . the fun and games are uncoordinated and slipshod . the film might have used updated marx brothers strategies instead of applying a para-clerks style which relies on frail crutches instead of tempo , energy or the occasional witticism . there are also other inconsistencies . in her letter of resignation , so to speak , brodie s girl lists his defects . brodie thinks that " callow " is the only nice thing in the letter , yet he will occasionally use a hi-fallutin  word . we also think for a long time that brodie and co . are high-schoolers , but are told at the end that they are college students . somehow , comic-book author and icon stan lee shows up , gives sage advice to brodie . it might have been amusing , it is merely artificial . and here and there are tentative take-offs , but these do not take off .

negativeC,' some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning , a live-action version of mr . magoo being a prime example . the cartoon figure mr . magoo , the bumbling blind man , can be quite funny , but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images . if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls , you are right , but there is an even more astonishing selection . for a director they tapped hong kong s stanley tong , whose resume consists mainly of a handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan . the story , such that there is one , is about a large , stolen ruby , which looks a woolworth reject . mr . magoo gets it and , of course , does not realize he has it . mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr . magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased . like home alone 3 but without any class , mr . magoo can only be described as painfully bad . fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity . the movie s humor is pathetically lame , and the pacing is way off . when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture , one looks for some solace . mr . magoo provides only three such moments . the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character , who exudes his usual charm . the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus , the sweet little bulldog . angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture . finally , the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie , which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked . rather than attempt to adapt mr . magoo to a non-cartoon movie , nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon . he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice , and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny . my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie , but i was not so lucky . hopefully , this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not . mr . magoo runs 1 : 37 . it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the movie was good and really funny , but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie . he said he liked home alone 3 much more . his friend maxim , age 9 , said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense . his other friend nickolas , age 8 , said he d give the movie  , but that it was really silly .

negativeC,' over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind s nuclear testing . partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . now it s 14 years after toho s remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . in emmerich s godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms . when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states . meanwhile , tatopoulos s college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter . she d like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break . of course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor " animal " palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey s trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place . together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla . with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation s premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla . he didn t . right up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history . the plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it s up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down . the script , however , is painfully bad . it s fraught with lines so corny , they don t even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , " you idiot , " or " you stupid girl . " i suppose when you ve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well . why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? why do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? okay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll . broderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he s weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . hank azaria does what he can , but don t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . like broderick s , azaria s character is quite simply lacking in color . what really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . casting must have been asleep on this one . the one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we ve seem him do in the past . although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . the entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . this results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? if we can t take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don t care what happens to them . godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be . far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here s a behemoth running through the city ! there s bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i . joe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm s way just in time . in a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire . none of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers . it s as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . consider another punch pulled . through creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn t just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently . it made me want to gag . emmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film . with an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . however , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn t work . now if they only had raymond burr . . . .

negativeC,' it s difficult to write a review of  in and out  without giving too much away . when i first heard about this film that bills itself as a comedy i was afraid that it might be offensive to members of the gay community . i don t know how some will react but as a straight person , i found it had many problems which i will describe later on . it s about a small town english teacher ( kevin kline ) whose former student goes on to win an academy award and during his acceptance speech thanks everyone who helped him make it possible and in his thanks he singles out kline as his former teacher and declares at the end of his speech that kline is gay . needless to say this causes the usual uproar of intolerance within the community from the close minded while it shocks and surprises many others . kline insists he is not gay but it s hard to convince everyone and his wedding is in three days ! two of the best films i ve seen in recent years dealing with homosexuality were  kiss of the spider woman  ( 1985 ) and  longtime companion  ( 1990 ) . what these films had in common is that they both took a forward look at their subject matter without making more about their themes than was necessary . they were extremely well acted ( william hurt won the oscar for  kiss of the spider woman  ) and they were memorable . what  in and out  does is take this very sensitive subject matter and treats its second half by being flagrantly condescending . to tell you anything more than that would spoil the film but its climax is disappointing and the entire film has frumpy humor to boot and doesn t quite know in many scenes when to make its point and leave . when the credits roll up the screen there are many unanswered questions and  in and out  is a true disappointment and believe me if you ve laughed at the coming soon attraction of this film or the television commercial advertising it , then you ve already seen most of the funny moments .

negativeC,' what were they thinking ? nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough , but do we really need an eighties film ? robbie hart ( adam sandler ) used to want to be a rock and roll star , but in 1985 he s singing at weddings and having a good time . a romantic at heart , he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his high-school sweetie . when she leaves him waiting at the altar , his tune changes to " love stinks " . he meets waitress julia ( drew barrymore ) who is engaged to a junk-bonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together . in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie . sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role , but there is no spark . barrymore doesn t seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it : beauty but no attitude . both characters are just there . bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show . the eighties are shoved in our face . references to deloreans , madonna , " dallas " , ivana and donald , burt and loni and " miami vice " get old fast . the filmmakers must have realized that there wasn t much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions . they re not funny and it doesn t work . with change on all fronts accelerating more and more , nostalgia appears to have a great appeal , but don t you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past . maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino .

negativeC,' director : simon west cast : john travolta , madeleine stowe , james cromwell , timothy hutton , clarence williams iii , james woods , rick dial , leslie stefanson screenplay : christopher bertolini , william goldman ( based on a novel by nelson demille ) producers : mace neufeld runtime : 120 min . us distribution : paramount pictures rated r : graphic sexual violence , nudity , language copyright 1999 nathaniel r . atchesonthe general s daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters . director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth . what s worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm . john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . brenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth s mentor , colonel moore ( james woods ) . soon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who . ebert s law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story . perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it s painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something . on a story level , the general s daughter is ineptly constructed . the film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille s novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and " shocking " plot developments . having not read the novel , it s difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree . scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines . ( sunderland actually asks brenner , " why was she killed ? " to which i would have answered , " if i knew , then the movie would already be over . " ) only after we ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored . not that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot . in one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask . she sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring . instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner s houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap . this scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it s gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film s complete disregard for the characters and the audience . it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise . i realized that these constructs on screen aren t actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story . this would have been bad enough without the west s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . compelling films about sexual crimes don t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don t show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be . in addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it s a perversion of everything we know to be pure . this standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up . as it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . perhaps the only positive elements in the general s daughter are a couple of the performances . james woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety . i also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous . nonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . the general s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments .

negativeC,' the most absurd remake of 1998 ? it s a toss up between gus van sant s psycho and mighty joe young , the new disney picture based on the old rko picture . ( i knew i was in trouble when a polished , computer-generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits . ) there is no great demand for another giant ape movie-make that ape movie , period . ( witness the quick deaths of buddy , born to be wild and congo . ) and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable , it s also an assembly line product through and through , lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it . theron is jill young : as a young girl in the wilds of africa , she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers . that baby gorilla ( nicknamed joe ) grows to immense proportions , and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him , playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers . enter conservationist greg ( paxton ) , who convinces jill to move with joe to california , where they can protect him better in a controlled environment . joe is restless at first ; no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l . a . , plotting joe s demise . suffice it to say , the movie could have been called " joe : ape in the city . " theron ( so good in devil s advocate ) and paxton ( so good in the recent a simple plan ) are fine actors , but not fine enough to transcend the material , a paint-by-numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising . the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg s the lost world than the 1949 original , with the computer-generated t-rex-i mean , joe-wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore ; the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third , with jill shouting , " look , joe s headed for the movie theatre ! " followed by a shot of joe scaling mann s chinese theater ; a moment later , jill shouts again something like " look , joe s headed for an amusement park ! " and what do you know , there s joe at the pallisades carnival , scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers . the seams of last-minute edits to mighty joe young show-unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves . the movie sure feels uneven , regardless : act two is underdeveloped , while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long , long way . underwood ( tremors , speechless ) was perhaps not the director for the job ; even the plentiful , untamed landscape looks dull in his hands . ( capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style . ) i did enjoy certain sequences , especially the demoliton of a black-tie dinner sequence ; and the prologue , however implausible , is touching . ( as a tyke , joe acts just like e . t . ) rick baker s make-up effects and puppetry are outstanding , the real star of the show-yet , for all its technical flawlessness , the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love . ( his facial expressions are variations on a scowl . ) to be fair , i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children-it s a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue . it s certainly not a film for very young kids-intense fighting scenes may scare them , while any time joe s not on camera may bore them to tears . ( note : older boys are more likely to be dazzled by theron s colourful array of tank tops . ) i suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing , but they sure don t make em like they used to .

negativeC,' capsule : this super-light situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems . the script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television . the characters are paper-thin and the interesting ideas purely non-existent . this is a decrement-life-by-90-minutes card . rating : 4 ( 0 to 10 ) , 0 ( -4 to + 4 ) jalla ! jalla ! is basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen . it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love . the film is set in sweden where roro and mans ( fares fares and torkel petersson ) are custodians at a public park . roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely , mans is a swede from a much more liberal background . they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park , cleaning up after dogs . roro and mans each have girlfriends , but each has a problem . roro ( nicknamed " jalla " ) is having family problems . it seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman , yasmin ( laleh pourkarim ) , but he is already in love with lisa ( tuva novotny ) . yasmin likes roro , but does not want to get married either . mans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence . the two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other . mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers . the one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them . roro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other , but then plan to break up before the wedding . not too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected . the plot turns in several places are contrived . one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen . lebanese-born josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer . when things start to get slow , he just adds throws in another story . for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film . characterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function . we do see some of roro s family life and his concerns . that may be because roro s background is a lot like that of the director . while the story was entertaining , i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film . it was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life . one does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this . i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

negativeC,' director : jon turtletaub cast : anthony hopkins , cuba gooding jr . , donald sutherland , maura tierney , george dzundza screenplay : gerald di pego ( based on the novel by daniel quinn ) producers : barbara boyle , michael taylor runtime : us distribution : buena vista pictures rated r : violence copyright 1999 nathaniel r . atchesonyou know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man . while watching instinct , i couldn t help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies . even beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn t a very good film . it s painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly . i didn t hate it -- it s simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good . but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved . i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it s pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams . things start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) . caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous . the subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years . powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it s now caulder s job to find out of he s mentally competent enough to stand trial . through a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell . even though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting . as i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he s on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he s not acting , that he s actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas . the character himself isn t very interesting -- he s just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action . gooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual . the screenplay , written by gerald di pego and " suggested by " a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he s obsessed with his work ) . nonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . unfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting . turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct s artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots . first , we have the prison warden subplot . the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder s progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that s fine . there s also the prison guard subplot . the prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he s instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion . then there s the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man . if some of this stuff sounds familiar , that s because they re all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films . the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here . the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo s nest had . ashton s evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown s in the shawshank redemption . hopkins  performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs . and then there s the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film . perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth . the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are " takers , " that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas . i can sympathize with that , but only when it s in a compelling film . this is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards . what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ? if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today . if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn t rely on the strength of its actors .

negativeC,' _dead_man_on_campus_ ( r )  ) while i am not fond of any writer s use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) . so here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival . strait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout )  s blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life . with the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good-hearted slackers to do ? easy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student s ( or students  ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as . so instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends . director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper s diabolical plot . until then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar s sitcom-bred mugging . that said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it . the introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) . one wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for . not surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty . the same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ . whatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go . _dead_man_ doesn t grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through . as it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . . like a zombie .

negativeC,' john carpenter s ghosts of mars ( 2001 ) . starring ice cube , natasha henstridge , jason statham , pam grier , joanna cassidy and clea duvall . written by larry sulkis and john carpenter . music by john carpenter . directed by carpenter . rated r . the red planet runs redder in john carpenter s ghosts of mars . those who enjoy watching decapitations and body limbs being hacked off will go orgasmic over this cartoonish piece of unoriginality . this pulplike outing is sloppy and derivative , owing much to carpenter s first big hit , assault on precinct 13 . so many parts of this movie go haywire that finding a starting point is difficult . first , carpenter offers a crash course on martian colonization , explaining that the colonists established a matriarchal society . this is merely a setup so the audience won t be shocked when they see female cops bossing men around . big deal . then , there s the confusing story structure . the film is told in flashback by lt . ballard ( natasha henstridge ) , the sole survivor of a team set to a distant mining town to check on a disturbance and bring back and well-known criminal named james " desolation " williams ( ice cube ) , whose characterization is most reminiscent of carpenter s napoleon wilson from precinct 13 . cube s williams even cribs some dialogue that is similar to lines spoken by wilson in the earlier flick . it seems that every major character must be given his or her own flashback , explaining events we are watching as they do voice overs . it becomes most repetitious and boring . carpenter takes too long in building up the suspense , and the payoff is a big let down . the martian ghosts - really dustlike particles that take over humans - create an army of zombies who run around shouting and killing colonists . the army also is a rip-off of the anonymous gangbangers who were mowed down during precinct 13 . even what is supposed to pass for witty repartee between henstridge s ballard and ice cube s williams seems forced . the chemistry factor is zero . carpenter does add a couple of interesting touches . ballard and her mouthy subordinate , jericho ( jason statham ) sneak off into a store room where jericho suggests they have one last fling before facing the overwhelming odds against them . instead of acting insulted or slapping his face , ballard pauses , agrees with him and begins sucking face . before anything can happen , though , those rude martians begin attacking again . ghosts of mars is one of carpenter s weakest efforts yet , and he has helmed a bunch of howlers . and carpenter doesn t help with his obnoxious , pulsating and loud score that blares every suspenseful piece of business as if it was the most important bit of action in the movie . this is one of those watch movies . no , you re not watching the screen , but checking your time piece to try to determine when it will all end . ghosts of mars is a snoozer . only the explosions may interfere with your napping . bob bloom is the film critic at the journal and courier in lafayette , in . he can be reached by e-mail at bloom@journal-courier . com or at bobbloom@iquest . net .  other reviews by bloom can be found at www . jconline . com by clicking on golafayette . bloom s reviews also can be found on the web at the internet movie database : http : //www . imdb . com/m/reviews_by ? bob + bloom '
negativeC,' call it a road trip for the walking wounded . stellan skarsgård plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it s difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . yet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . that s an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsgård ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . they haven t spoken in years , and wouldn t even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren t for kaisa s mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . in a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . ( only in the movies , right ? ) too blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . loathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . despite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn t fallen very far from the tree . kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . ain t they a pair ? unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . by the time they reach the hospital , it s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . this revelation exists purely for its own sake . aberdeen doesn t know where else to go . weak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . if lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . headey s too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . if she were paying any attention to skarsgård , maybe she d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . it s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter s captivating signs & wonders . it s not just because skarsgård and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . in aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . despite skarsgård s solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . there s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . nossiter s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . if signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it s willing to stretch beyond what we ve come to expect from traditional drama . aberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan s trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin s hollywood mogul pronounces , " all of life s riddles are answered in the movies ! " even foreign films are taking that advice to heart . '
negativeC,' directed by paul verhoeven . screenplay by andrew w marlowe from a story by gary scott thompson and marlowe . starring kevin bacon , elisabeth shue , josh brolin . running time : 112 minutes . rated r for extreme violence and offensive language throughout by the mfcb . reviewed on august 7th , 2000 . what would you do if you could turn invisible ? the possibilities are virtually limitless . there are the cheap , visceral thrills , such as sneaking into changing rooms and dormitories . there are more noble pursuits , like acting as a genuine force for good in your community . perhaps you could offer your services to the government as a crack espionage agent . well , if the makers of " hollow man " are to believed , you d probably take a page from any generic slasher movie of the past twenty-five years and start hunting down your friends in gory , if not particularly imaginative , ways . uh huh . inspired by , though not really similar to , hg wells  novel " the invisible man " , " hollow man " is about a team of scientists trying to create an invisibility formula ( here it s described as " going out of quantum synch " with the universe , but of course that s just the technobabble explanation ) . the project head is dr sebastian caine ( kevin bacon ) , an arrogant genius with more than a slight streak of megalomania . his assistants include ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) and matt ( josh brolin ) , who are sleeping together behind sebastian s back . in fact , the team has already figured out how to make people become invisible -- the problem lies in trying to reverse the effects . in a flash of inspiration one night , sebastian thinks he figures it out , and indeed their test gorilla isabelle is successfully made visible again . without informing his superiors , sebastian decides to proceed to the next stage of the experiment and test both serums on a human subject : himself . but although he becomes invisible without undue difficulty , the antidote proves to be useless on humans , and sebastian is trapped in his phantomlike state . soon , the tantalising possibilities invisibility offers become too much for sebastian , and he begins to succumb to his base desires . " hollow man " falls short in all moviemaking fundamentals : plot , characterisation , atmosphere . even paul verhoeven s directorial flair , striking in " total recall " ten years ago , is absent here , as the director continues the downward spiral most recently evident in the tedious " starship troopers " . i find it appalling that a movie can take such a great , multifaceted concept -- invisibility -- and hogtie itself to a standard old slasher storyline . and " hollow man " isn t even a particularly good slasher film , because we re not so much as afforded an interesting death sequence . sebastian s murderous rampage , when it finally comes , is without tension , excitement , or invention . it s just an invisible guy killing people , as if that single gimmick would somehow enliven the entire film . there s no effort to create any suspense , or to really shock the viewer ; it just feels like the filmmakers are going through the motions , and rather feebly at that . personally , i m more interested in special effects where i can see something , rather than those where i can t . sure , a good job is done to achieve the appearance ( as it were ) of invisibility , and i m sure it took a lot of hard work , but the gosh-wow factor is exhausted pretty quickly . the same goes for the scenes where sebastian suddenly becomes semi-visible , when he is immersed in water or smoke or whatever . the first such sequence is appealing ; the concept gets tired soon thereafter . indeed , the only effects which really left an impression on me were the scenes where the invisibility formula and its antidote are employed -- first on a gorilla , then on sebastian . instead of taking effect all at once , the serums work layer by layer , giving us a view of the inner workings of the bodies like an anatomy textbook brought to life . beyond this , there is little to recommend " hollow man " . kevin bacon does a reasonable job in a role in which his voicework is paramount . but sebastian caine is a desperately uninteresting character . we are robbed of the chance to investigate whether or not it is invisibility which has affected his mind , because he s clearly on the edge even before the experiment . a far more interesting approach to have taken would have been to give us a less unscrupulous character and really delve into the temptations he experiences . sebastian is already such a bastard that his swift decision to abandon his already loose morals comes as little surprise . i realise that " hollow man " is , first and foremost , a thriller , and i am not suggesting that it should have been bogged down in ethical posturing . but i think a more clever movie could have balanced its protagonist s inner turmoil with the requisite action scenes . to make matters worse , the screenplay by andrew w marlowe ( from a story co-conceived with gary scott thompson ) doesn t even come up with interesting things for the invisible sebastian to do . indeed , of all the scenes involving sebastian s abuse of his power , the only one that s at all intriguing is the very first one , where he molests a co-worker ( kim dickens ) , with her being only barely aware of it . there is a definite eroticism to this scene , not the least because of the conflict previously established between the two characters . but it s all downhill from there -- we subsequently get another excuse for partial nudity , and then it s slasher time . that such a fantastic premise is so thoroughly wasted is the surest sign of the sheer creative bankruptcy of the movie . amongst the supporting cast , shue and brolin try gamely to play the heroes , but neither of their characters have much personality to speak of . the film s engagement in a bit of role reversal , casting shue as the more proactive of the pair , is but a minor triumph . most of the other characters are simply there to act as cannon fodder , although dickens and joey slotnick make the most of their small roles . no fair guessing who survives and who doesn t , though . in order to surprised on that point , there would have to be some imagination behind the movie . on the set of " hollow man " , it seems that bodies weren t the only things made to vanish . copyright © 2000 shannon patrick sullivan . archived at the popcorn gallery , http : //www . physics . mun . ca/~sps/movies/hollowman . html _______________________________________________________________________ / shannon patrick sullivan | " we are all in the gutter , but some of us \ | shannon@mun . ca | are looking at the stars .

negativeC,' in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french-canadian co-production by max fischer . the movie is set in paris where its hero , struggling american author david mirkine ( judd nelson , at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity ) suffers a terrible writers bloc . he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle ( laurence treill ) . unfortunately , she hangs out in jet set circles , which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous . her connection with powerful david caravan ( pierce brosnan ) would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events . although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller , drama would probably be more appropriate genre label . pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers , and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments . low budget also becomes painfully visible , and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film . unfortunately , this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes , so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed . instead , they would have to settle with pointless , slow scenes involving nelson , brosnan and laurence treill s attempts of serious acting . all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone s precious time .

negativeC,' rated on a 4-star scale screening venue : odeon ( liverpool city centre ) released in the uk by uip on january 21 , 2000 ; certificate 18 ; 102 minutes ; country of origin usa ; aspect ratio 2 . 35 : 1 directed by rupert wainwright ; produced by frank mancuso jr . written by tom lazarus , rick ramage . photographed by jeffrey l kimball ; edited by michael j duthie , michael r miller . " stigmata " starts as a badly made film , proceeds as a muddled one and ends up as psychotic . the final moments of this movie attack the roman catholic church in the manner of a deranged ex-girlfriend -- wasting our time , solemnly declaring ridiculous accusations , making a lot of noise but no sense . the first act introduces us to frankie paige ( patricia arquette ) , an attractive pittsburgh hairdresser who exists in one of those fairytale movie worlds where , at work , she walks in to find everyone greeting her like she s just come back from holiday , and , at night , she always gets to her favourite night club to find her friends already waiting there . there are lots of lingering close-ups of her drinks and cigarettes ; look , kids , she s naughty . . . this is what big grown-up people call a  wanton lifestyle  ! meanwhile a priest played by gabriel byrne , father andrew kiernan , is travelling around the world investigating reports of miracles . he s an objective , scientific fellow , we learn , who would never be taken in by a hoax . but when he assesses a statue of the virgin mary that cries blood , and comes to the conclusion that the relic is genuine , the cardinals at the vatican don t pay it any mind . instead , they just send him on another assignment , this time to examine frankie . she has been seen reacting to hallucinations and displaying signs of stigmata , a phenomenon whereby christians with strong faith and empathy with jesus will break out in the wounds their saviour suffered on the cross . but frankie is an atheist , and the pointless middle of " stigmata " , which is a battle to stay awake through , mentions this discrepancy a lot without actually explaining it . instead , every " how could this happen to me ? " moment is interrupted by jarring music chords and fits of screaming , as frankie freaks out like linda blair in " the exorcist " . is she possessed by something evil , as blair s character was ? i m still not sure . if i followed the movie correctly , the soul of a dead catholic priest has invaded her by storing his soul in magic rosary beads , to use her as a messenger and announce his discovery of christ s own version of the gospel . the stigmata is a side-effect of all the holy phenomena floating around , and this joyful miracle only seems like an attack by a demonic force because the priest is so darn angry at the state of the vatican . this is ridiculous , but gets even more farfetched , when the film explicitly accuses catholicism of being a conspiracy against god . just before the end credits , factoids and statistics appear onscreen to tell us how many reports of miracles the vatican have dismissed as fake . that the director , rupert wainwright , could think this is serious evidence of corruption suggests he s the kind of guy who would look at the circus antics of a kooky talk show like " jerry springer " and declare them to contain compelling social exposé . even his visual style gets on my nerves -- from the outset he keeps switching between grainy documentary realism and saturated slow-motion montages of bad dance music , which play like demented coca-cola commercials . watching gabriel byrne in this movie , i pondered the possibility that he enjoys deliberately appearing in bad religious pictures . only a few weeks ago he played satan in " end of days " , which , like " stigmata " , used half-baked knowledge about catholicism as an excuse for a lot of ugly gore and noise . byrne is a good actor ; if you ever pass by a film set and see him , try to get his autograph . if you see a crucifix anywhere nearby , though , ask him the title of the movie he s working on and tell all your friends to avoid it . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantganiplease visit , and encourage others to visit , the uk critic s website , which is located at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic '
negativeC,' to watch a steven seagal film , one must fully suspend all disbelief . and to fully enjoy the audacity of seagal , one must ignore all of the consequences associated with the following : starting fistfights with large men in flashy nightclubs , destroying everything in sight along the way . surviving every semi-automatic gun battle and car crash without a scratch . purchasing italian racing cars with bundles of $100 bills stuffed in a gym bag . actually being able to cash out stock options from a dot-com and then creating a private surveillance unit devoted to uncovering a ring of corrupt detroit cops involved in smuggling heroin inside of sweatshop-produced t-shirts . ok . . . maybe that corrupt cops thing is a bit hard to swallow . i remember a time when i used to enjoy seagal . such films as above the law , hard to kill , marked for death , under siege , and out for justice are all solid action films from the  90s . under siege is even kind of good . but lately , films like under siege 2 , fire down below , and the patriot have shown the age of the italian stallion of aikido . now , exit wounds stands as seagal s biggest failure , a pitiful reminder of the death of the american action film . by overextending the violence , the ludicrousness , and the sheer improbability of everything , exit wounds plays out like a circus of the damned with tom arnold working the tilt-a-whirl . ( speaking of tom arnold , it s always a bad sign when his thespian attempts at comedy are the most memorable parts of a film . ) exit wounds is bad -- really , really bad . should you care about the plot , the mighty steven plays orin boyd , a burned out cop without his trademark pony-nub who gets reassigned to a tough detroit precinct after saving the vice-president s life during a michigan militia terrorist act . apparently , this particular precinct is filled with police officers who use the gym way too much , use stun guns in strange naked homoerotic bonding moments , and routinely steal heroin from police labs to fund those out-of-state fishing trips so popular among detroit city cops . then there s dmx , the hardcore rapper-turned-actor who does a better job in his music videos than in this role as a stereotypical drug dealer/club owner/martial arts master/dot-com entrepreneur . seagal and dmx team up to stop the corrupt cop ring , run by michael jai white ( spawn ) . the gratuitous violence of exit wounds would have made peckinpah cringe and reach for the stop button on the remote . in earlier seagal films , you got brief moments of violence that made the films memorable and not so gory . exit wounds overflows with carnage -- people being bloodied by fists wrapped in chains , body parts being impaled on exposed bolts and pipes , people being crushed by oncoming cars and buses . and every single car involved in a chase sequence erupts in flames , of course . the biggest shame of the film is the misuse of seagal . instead of having seagal demonstrate the prowess and speed of a 7th dan of aikido , shown off so well in his earlier films , he ends up being nothing more than a patsy , used to connect the dots of all the inane plot points in what stands as a truly rotten film .

" evolution " is a movie more concerned with its special effects ( which are quite good ) than anything resembling a consistently funny script . it has its moments ( a scene in which jones  body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining ) , but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour . moore is totally wasted , her clumsy shtick getting very old , very fast . duchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with . and the story is so formulaic , it could have been written by monkeys . part of what made " ghostbusters " so wonderful was a combination of a great script and characters the audience could root for . " evolution " is so mind-numbingly tedious that it s difficult not to start cheering for the aliens . copyright © 2001 shannon patrick sullivan . archived at the popcorn gallery , http : //www . physics . mun . ca/~sps/movies . html | shannon patrick sullivan | shannon@mun . ca | + --------------------------------- + --------------------------------- + / doctor who : a brief history of time ( travel ) go . to/drwho-history \ \__ we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars __/ '

" bless the child " is yet another shoddy and uninteresting movie about dark forces -- throw it onto the pile with " stigmata " and " book of shadows : blair witch 2 " . basinger stars as maggie o connor , a psychiatric nurse left to raise her young niece cody ( holliston coleman ) when her heroin-addicted sister jenna ( angela bettis ) skips town . the child is quiet and withdrawn -- autistic , everyone assumes , until she s kidnapped by a gang of satan-worshipping child killers who have discovered she s the second coming , and want to use her power for evil . the first half of the movie involves basinger s raising of the child ; it s dumb in its hammy dialogue and cliched , obvious scenes of creepy noises coming from nowhere clear , but so familiar it s somewhat involving , and contains the potential to turn into good pulp fiction . structural elements are stolen from " the exorcist " , and hey , if you re gonna steal , steal from the best . ah , but it turns to vinegar . it s annoying stupid , not fun stupid . there are a parade of vulgar scenes depicting the kid s greatness , showing her bring birds back to life and light candles through telekinesis , during which i thought , shouldn t the child of god be a wise and kind-hearted revolutionary , rather than a smug little kid pulling houdini tricks ? several moments defy common sense , such as one in which a cult defector sits in a cafe giving basinger information , and in run a bunch of satanists who give the defector chase and don t think to touch basinger at all . the movie wants us to take it seriously , and yet there are sneering villains , guns waved around , and cars dangling off bridges . it s funny at times -- how could it not be when one of the baddies is a ludicrously stone-faced mrs . danvers clone , the climax takes place in a cobweb-filled haunted house , and at one point knitting needles are used as murder weapons ? at other times it s just sick -- you can t laugh too hard when you re watching devil-worshippers burning homeless people to death and committing ritual infanticide . one other thing -- the special effects are terrible . they look like pieces of cartoon superimposed over live action . five years ago movie visuals were so perfect that mentioning them in reviews seemed redundant . nowadays they almost always suck . a sign , perhaps , that the digital revolution ain t all it s cracked up to be ? copyright 2001 ian waldron-mantganithe uk critic is located at www . ukcritic . com '
negativeC,' capsule : repugnant , overlong anime that makes it clear how the genre sometimes gets its bad name . anime , like any other genre or group , gets an undeservedly bad reputation from its worst members . aside from the wretched and overrated overfiend , there s other culprits : the insanely dull odin , for one . and angel cop , which is just plain vile . what can you say about a story where the title cards are spelled out in splattered blood to the sound of machine-gun fire , and then goes downhill from there ? angel cop is like a bad version of sylvester stallone s cobra fused with a really low-rent rip-off of the first power and some robocop thrown in for good measure -- which is really saying something , since first power and cobra were wretched to begin with . any association with robocop is a slur on that fine movie . the whole thing clocks in at slightly under two and a half hours -- edited together from five half-hour pieces , but while they were doing that , they could certainly have brought the story down to a less painful length . the plot : an avowedly communist cell named the red may are trying to destabilize japan through acts of terrorism . to combat this threat , the police have created a black-bag ops group who work above the law . ( yes , i m quoting pretty much word-for-word . ) their leader s so macho he doesn t bother wearing a shirt , but this has to be the first anime where i ve seen a normal guy who looked like he had more scar tissue than healthy flesh . oh , i m sorry -- that s chest hair , combined with particularly bad character animation . he is assigned a new partner , a female cop named angel who s probably even more violent and undisciplined than he is . in a scene where the partner s got a gun to her head , she blows away one of the other terrorists in the room , splattering brains and bone all over the wall . in detail . part of the story ostensibly concerns how angel goes from an unfeeling bitch to someone with a bit more heart , but the way angel cop plays that point off is by giving her the nerve to ultimately blow her partner s brains out ( and all over their enemy ) . oh . angel is , as are the rest of the characters , mostly nonentities who do what the plot and the screenplay tell them to do -- which is shoot people , blow things up , fall out of windows , and karate-chop people to death . their enemies are not much better , although they get a few allies who are marginally interesting ( before they get killed rather unceremoniously ) . i wish there was more to leave out , but i ll sum by saying angel cop is a good way not to introduce someone to anime .

negativeC,' in dreams reviewed by jamie peckrating :  dreamworks skg / 1 : 40 / 1999 / r ( violence , language ) cast : annette bening ; aidan quinn ; stephen rea ; robert downey jr . ; paul guilfoyle director : neil jordan screenplay : bruce robinson ; neil jordan  " in dreams " might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . no , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie s brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . the big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind " the crying game . " he s no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . things start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji s stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat . this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there s even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn t deserve so good a polish , it s this one . don t knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue . annette bening , another asset " in dreams " shouldn t be so lucky to boast , gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn t do much for her in return . she plays claire cooper , a massachusetts children s book illustrator who s plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children . she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible , soon-to-be-committed crimes , but neither her ho-hum husband ( aidan quinn ) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously . this being a thriller , we know that she is , in fact , on the money , and it s a credit to bening s acting that she delves equally into claire s madness and compassion . but as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims , " in dreams " trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense . scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition . subplots appear and disappear . when claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer ( robert downey jr . ) , it turns out his name is vivian , he s clairvoyant and he s got some major issues with mama , a la norman bates . " in dreams " reaches its absurdist zenith here , and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists . some questions , then : what s with the garbage disposal retching applesauce ? are the drawings on the wall blood or paint ? who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own ? what about the computer ? does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers ? why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan ? is the woman in australia integral to anything ? and the aforementioned flooded city - what function does that _really_ serve ? sigh . at least in my own dreams , i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn t go to waste . © 1999 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/ " like so many horror films , this one is set on a national holiday - the fourth of july . christmas and graduation day are also popular , although thanksgiving now seems reserved for movies about dysfunctional families .

negativeC,' how could a g-rated disney film based on meg cabot s novel " the princess diaries " be anything but cute , harmless fun ? easy . take all the cute , harmless fun out of it . and while you re at it make it borrr-ring . that s what director garry marshall , screenwriter gina wendkos and , not to be outdone , producer whitney houston have done with the g-rated disney film " the princess diaries . " you couldn t tell it from the audience though , a braintree , mass . of growing , glowing pre-pubescent girls ( and the odd parental , popcorn perched about their persons ) , who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ( ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy-duddy old me ) . well , i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over , but that would have been too obvious . too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall s film ( garry made a couple of other " princess " movies-- " pretty woman " and " runaway bride " --but this one s way without julia roberts so maybe * that s * its problem ) . in addition to being predictable as molasses , " the princess diaries " has hardly got a laugh in it ( it s a comedy ) , could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long , long stretches , and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we haven t even seen yet ( and probably never will except , perhaps , in the dvd edition ) . marshall should take virtually all of the blame here , since he s been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two isn t working . . . and hardly * any * of " the princess diaries " works ( " works , " alas , implies cleverness and there s none of that here either ) . newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis , a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom ( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall ) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of ( the filmmakers go out of their way * not * to call it serbia , which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words ) and now she , mia , is next in line to rule " genovia " ( hence the headphones/tiara combo in the print ads ) . julie andrews , with the luminous factor cranked to 11 , plays mia s grandmother ( aka queen clarisse renaldi ) , who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating , talking , and looking like a princess department ( although mia s big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan ) .

" zardoz " is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman s . his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even " the wizard of oz , " a book which figures into the movie s plot . but , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling . the events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found . in fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions . it s more middle ages than space age . the world of " zardoz " is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life . these immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society . however , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years . if someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals . one of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed . like " the wizard of oz , " he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head . ( this flying head is one of the movie s opening images , and it s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . ) calling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can t procreate and take up more resources . from inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , " the gun is good . the penis is evil . " that line alone is worth the movie s cult following . one day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz s flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex . once there , the immortals label him a " brutal " and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them . they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up . i say " hilarious " because that is exactly what " zardoz " is . it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of " deliverance , " which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort . he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( " 2001 " ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in " zardoz " besides the inadvertent humor . sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . he got exactly that in " zardoz , " and it s a wonder it didn t end his career . i m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? or is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . come to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy .

( of course , the boyfriend s original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger . ) if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful , then it fails . there are surprisingly few tense moments in this film , and nearly all of them come at the final minute . by that time , however , the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them . no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception . if the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous , then it also fails . i found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed , at times , to be played for laughs . if the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic , then , once again , it fails . the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting . finally , if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating ( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning ) , then it fails as well . the dream sequences aren t erotic ; they are too brief and , outside of one very short scene , contain no nudity . i can t completely trash this movie . the first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film , and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight . the other 79 minutes , though , are a drag . silverstone s character , at the end of the movie , turns to her boyfriend and asks " what were you thinking ? " i asked myself the same question , having spent 99 cents renting this turkey . '

" ) , the temptation was great to hang up my liberal conscience and join charlton heston s merry men at the nra . i had to remind myself , " it s only a movie , it s only a movie " '
negativeC,'  runaway bride  is such a bad film that it s difficult to know where to begin . the poster for it certainly made it look like it was more interested in showing the physical attributes of its stars rather than their talents . their smiles , their smirks , their way with each other that was all seen in 1990 s  pretty woman  . the mismatched man and woman who dislike each other at first but later fall in love in such an unconvincing manner that not only is it an insult to the audiences intelligence but takes two very serious subjects like prostitution ( the background subject of  pretty woman  ) and libelous journalism ( the background subject of  runaway bride  ) and sugar coats them in a shameful manner . if you re going to make a film like this , why inflate it with such an overblown cast of characters who mean nothing to the story except to the actors playing them as well as the people calling the shots ? i think if you asked most movie audiences , they probably would have wanted to see a sequel to  pretty woman  nine years after the original with more admirable qualities rather than another pairing of its two leading stars in a movie with different material . look at 1997 . the cast of 1988 s  a fish called wanda  teamed up for  fierce creatures  an abysmal attempt to go home again and capture the magic of the original chemistry that  wanda  was able to project . better yet , how about a prequel to  pretty woman  showing how the character s lives progressed into their eventual choices to make a living and eventually meeting each other . but no , director garry marshall chooses to take his skill that has never really amounted to anything above the level of television entertainment and make a movie that appeals only to a certain audience and has very little to offer to anyone else . in  runaway bride  , gere plays ike graham , a journalist for usa today who writes a story that causes a firestorm of controversy . his source , an intoxicated guy in a bar , tells ike that there s a woman in small-town america named maggie carpenter ( julia roberts ) who has developed a habit of being a man-eater . she has allegedly dumped several would be grooms at the altar and earned the nick name " runaway bride " because she literally runs away , bridal dress and all and one incident shows here managing to escape on a horse at full charge . after writing an anti-female article that knocks maggie at every turn , women rap ike on the head with a copy of the newspaper as he walks the big city streets and his editor and ex-wife ( rita wilson ) fires him after she says that the stuff he wrote is " actionable " on the part of its subject . determined to stand by his story win vindication for himself and investigate maggie herself , ike travels to her small town and encounters its culture with all of its people and , of course , ike and maggie fall in love but do they stay together ? you ll have to see for yourself .  runaway bride  had me wanting to scream in disgust at many of the obvious phony scenes of a relationship that is not in the least bit convincing and its climax which involves the news of how the two leads lives turn out for the moment , has all of the films characters receiving the news one way or the other and projecting their reaction to it like you would react to a plot twist in your favourite soap opera . to further complicate things , there are even some in-jokes about  pretty woman  which aren t even funny . the most manipulative film in the last ten years is 1989 s  dead poets society  which saved itself by giving the audience an original story to fall back on and the outcome was both believable and flowed naturally and didn t look manufactured . when a film can manipulate its audience and disguise it as genuine entertainment , it s still sort of a cheat but at least it can make up for its shortcomings by injecting a sense of convincing traits . the manipulation here is both obvious with no redeeming qualities and a style similar to fast food which is digested quickly and forgotten even faster .

negativeC,' underwater science fiction stays submergedone of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents . you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered . psychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash . when he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years . having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship . his group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist . unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team . " after all , " he explains , " who reads government documents ? " lead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel . once there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still-operational ufo . discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere . when adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds . a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer . " my name is jerry . i am happy " flashes across the screen . this is unsettling for the psychologist . " what happens if jerry gets mad ? " he asks . barnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can t put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry . then the situation turns bad . deadly beasts appear from nowhere . a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel . lethal sea snakes attack goodman . a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading " 20 , 000 leagues under the sea " . the suspicious scientists turn against each other . this has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man s science fiction film . however even the finest ingredients don t go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn t seem to care about his product . director barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn t engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes . the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification . it s much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances . it doesn t get any better when the action scenes begin . while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat . oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them . after adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened . their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited . even goodman and halperin s ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing . her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing . there s a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending , but here they are far too obvious . when an emergency mini-sub is explained , you know what s going to happen . the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting . chapter headings that divide the movie have no function . the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos . much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow . although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable , a great deal of it isn t . even a science fiction film must be internally consistent . there s too much here that doesn t make sense . are the manifestations real ? the jellyfish kill queen latifa ( in a throw-away role ) and the squid nearly destroys the outpost , but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect . a scene in the sub suggests that it s illusion , but earlier episodes indicate that it s not . not everything has to be explained to death , but there are major questions that the film never answers . where the ship came from is clarified , but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to . even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll . the climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale . after pre-release audience testing , the actors were called back to re-shoot the ending . it s difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse . following the recent tradition of lengthy films , this weighs in at over two very long hours . the weak scenes could have been cut , but then there wouldn t have been much left . the movie was supposedly held up by effects work , but there s nothing special on the screen . we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm . stealing from " alien " , " the abyss " and the disastrous " event horizon " , this film has learned nothing from them . remarkably levinson and hoffman s other currently showing film is " wag the dog " , a smart and entertaining piece of work . this one could have been titled the same sans one word .

negativeC,' director : john bruno cast : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland screenplay : dennis feldman , jonathan hensleigh producers : gale anne hurd , mike richardson runtime : us distribution : universal rated r : sci-fi violence/gore , language copyright 1998 nathaniel r . atchesonthe most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes . alas , it refers to our heroes ! as it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further . after all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one . but the human race doesn t have much to worry about . after all , there s a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus . she s the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus ) . they re all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous , abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters . lucky for us , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board . the evil captain everton thinks he s going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there s going to be big money , so they try to salvage the ship . soon , however , when it s apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power , they realize that something bad must have happened . finally , they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship ! it s creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race ! virus is a truly dumb action thriller , one of negligible intelligence and innovation . when considering the entire film , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene . it s a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens , the abyss , and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly , it s basically the same movie as last year s deep rising . i liked deep rising simply because it s funny -- it knows it s silly and derivative . virus takes itself seriously . and , in the most serious manner possible , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre , showing you countless familiar scenes , and sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming . but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out . okay , let me get this straight -- the alien race ( which is never really explained ) is basically sentient electricity . they need to make themselves physical , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water , but who cares about that ) . on the ship , they make a bunch of clunky , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people . after that , they start using the dead people to create half-human , half-machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around . the leader , of course , is a big creature . every film like this has a big creature at the end , but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around . virus is indeed a cliched film , but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn t very threatening . it s established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it , but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there . on one level , virus is almost passable fun . it s really gory , and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal ( the director , john bruno , worked on a lot of cameron s films ) . there s also a nice array of actors , even though none of them do any acting ( except for donald sutherland , who does a lot of very bad acting ) . the bottom line , however , is this : virus is a bad movie . it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing . in that order , i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films , simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes .

negativeC,' before the remake of psycho appears , we ve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder . as usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars , and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing . the film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen )  having fun  in an loft apartment . the problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) , who is not too happy when he discovers this affair . if i was paltrow , though , i d definitely go with mortensen . less wrinkles . anyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition : he ll pay him to kill his lovely wife . mortensen agrees , but the murder goes awry , and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses . unfortunately , the film dosen t progress very fast . in fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s-l-o-w . ) the plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts . not too good for a  thriller .   also , the performances , apart from douglas , are below par . paltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie . mortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role isn t meaty enough to show all his talent . which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is does . however , i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside . also popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective . again , it s not a character we re seeing on the screen , it s david suchet . the director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom-in s , quick cuts , etc . the lighting is also interesting . however , looks can t save this film from the depths of mediocre , and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway . the screenplay is o . k , but there s some hackneyed sub-plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched . the characters also make incredibly dumb moves , especially paltrow , and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel . with a combination of no tension , drama , or decent characters , a perfect murder is a failure all round , and an incredible disappointment . there are a few bright moments , but they are far and few between . the last thing a thriller should be is boring , and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas , you wouldn t be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder .

negativeC,' directed by brian robbins . cast : james van der beek , jon voight , paul walker , ron lester , amy smart , ali larter , scott caan . 1999 - 104 minutes . rated r ( for profanity , sexual situations , and nudity ) . reviewed january 9 , 1999 . " varsity blues " is the best film of 1999 thus far . unfortunately , it is also the first film i have seen from 1999 . it is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-heartedfrom 1999 . it is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-hearted protagonist ; a rough and meanspirited coach ; and the " big game . " by the end , will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph ? will everyone in the town turn against the coach ? will the team win the climactic game ? do cats bathe themselves regularly ? the so-called " hero " in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town . at least he s got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming . heck , in one scene , the front page of the town s newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers  big win the night before . when the team s star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team s leader , but his few minutes of glory do not last long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter ) . and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the " bad guy " ) . worse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john s scholarship chances if the badgers don t win their final game . the plotting of " varsity blues " is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book . admittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . throughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983 s " all the right moves . " one of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not john , who , played by van der beek ( of tv s " dawson s creek " ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities . while i probably shouldn t blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and " by-the-numbers " screenplay by w . peter iliff isn t of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in " all the right moves . " the story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama . the romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don t think i ve seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence . smart does not allow her character to become the " passive girlfriend , " instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions . it s too bad the camera didn t linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts . the adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football . john s relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance . his father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn t want any part of that . his mother stands beside her " big , strong husband " and is a passive female . finally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional . saving " varsity blues " from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me . the scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn t overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to . but leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ? i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood . do we really need another high-school sports film ? no , we don t , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films . " varsity blues , " no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts . - copyright 1999 by dustin putman dustin putman s film haven  '
negativeC,' robin williams , this time without a beard , returns to drama in this sloppy , sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects . he plays chris nielsen , who meets annie ( annabella sciora ) and promptly marries her . they have two great kids , who sadly die in a car crash . just when it couldn t get any worse , chris gets killed in a car crash , and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert ( gooding jnr . ) annie can t take the grief anymore , and kills herself . ( all sounding like good fun so far ? ) the  penalty  for suicide is to go to hell , and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller ( max von sydow . ) based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson , what dreams may come is clunky , manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar . this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made . everything is wrong about this movie : the performances are forced , and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters . williams puts on a convincing upset face , but that s all it is : a face . there s no emotion behind it . sciora s performance is lazy , and bogs down the whole film . she may look pretty , but she can t act . max von sydow is o . k as the traveller , if nothing special . cuba gooding jnr , thankfully , adds some bounce to his performance , and is certainly the best performer in the film . it s a shame that his character is so flat and 2-d , and offers no room for improvement . all the performers have to work with a soppy script , that tries it s best to get some emotion going , but never takes off the ground . there are _some_ scenes which could be real heartwarmers , but the faceless characters don t help to get anything out of the performers . while films like e . t used great actors , music and direction to pull of a masterful heart-tugging scene , what dreams may come is haphazard , expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically . instead , it s all rather boring . sure , the music is pretty ( by michael kamen ) and the cinematography isn t bad ( by eduardo serra ) but there s something lacking . the script doesn t help , filled with hopeless romantic clichés , and dud speeches . richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories , sadly this novel would look embarrassed in a bargain bin , let alone being converted into a $70 million vehicle for robin williams . despite being set in heaven , what dreams may come is mightily depressing . the film rushes a happy ending , but everything before this is very , very sad and black , which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid . but there s one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie : the special effects . heaven and hell are truly incredible places , and the actors fit perfectly with the virtual sets . but despite this , what dreams may come , proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of 1998 . instead of raising questions about existence , it raises boredom . sadly , i recommend you give this film a miss . better luck next time , robin .

( just to make an idle point , i did like " toy story , " but that was good ) also , i have this aversion to bad french farces , and if they remake them into american films . well , this is my excuse : it was prom night , i m not a prom person , my best friend and i impulsively went to the drive-ins where they were playing " grosse pointe blank " - wouldn t mind seeing it again - but i had to suffer through this first . i agreed to go . ugh . in all fairness , i can say that at least this inane plot wasn t dreamed by an american . it was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of " little indian , big city " ( french title - " un indien dans la ville " ) . i stayed away from it like it was limburgher , and according to roger ebert , that was a good idea . but i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement . the stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his current marriage . let me clarify : his wife ( jobeth williams ) left him years ago , and i mean years - around 13 or so - and went to an island in the carribean or something . he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this . . . thing ( played with an emphasis on over-done by lolita davidovitch , who is usually good ) . she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off . he meets him , he has a weird name ( mimi seku , i think . . . or as the bad joke goes - " mitsubishi " - laugh track cue ) , he knows english , they fish , more bad jokes , pirhanna joke , the kid has a pet spider , he makes a promise to take him to the statue of liberty . . . you know the drill . now this is where the plot complicates ( well , complicates for this one , at least ) : the fish-out-of-water joke switches from tim allen on an island to his island son in new york city . tim is a stock broker and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasn t able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is - martin short . a russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere ( how come in every hokey french import , there is a mob ? ! ) tim learns a lesson of life from his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries . the story is crap , the jokes are hokey and not really funny , and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting . but the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldn t help it . the whole time , i kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up and several more grown people had to do this . at the end of filming , did they all scream out , " we ve made a great movie , guys ! " i sure hope not . big question to get from this film : why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if they re just going to do it the exact same way ? huh ? my rating ( out of 5 ) : ( for some of the actors  names and a joke or two that made me chuckle , i guess . . . okay , so i really feel bad for it , so i only gave it one star ) '
negativeC,' the outrageous antics of comedian rodney dangerfield are seen in such hilarious films as  caddyshack  ( 1980 ) ,  easy money  ( 1983 ) and  back to school  ( 1986 ) .  back to school  is probably the funniest and most likable of these films but dangerfield ( who is 75 ) has lost his way pretty much with  meet wally sparks  . rodney portrays an unorthodox tabloid talk show host who becomes mixed up in one wild situation with a southern governor and his family who are extremely conservative . dangerfield s son becomes romantically involved with the governor s daughter and a television executive s assistant who s trying to have rodney fired is in tow and gets exactly what he deserves . throw in a political sex scandal and a head butting feud with dangerfield s television boss ( burt reynolds ) and you have the makings for a trivial and desperate comedy of enormously bad proportions . someone should have told dangerfield ( who co-wrote the picture ) that less is sometimes more and that good comedy doesn t necessarily include throwing in everything but the kitchen sink in order to make people laugh and the film degrades not only itself but the audience . furthermore the film is bogged down with dangerfield s one liners that are growing tiresome . it s slapstick humour is both juvenile and self defeating . given the limited release this film had , i suspect that it may have been considered at some point as a direct to video release . dangerfield s fans will be pleased but others may feel that even though we somehow know what to expect going in , we don t expect the humour to hammer us over the head like a baseball bat .

negativeC,' apparantly money talks . . . and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so ! i ve always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess , whether in language , violence , sex , or what have you . i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard , and money talks definitely does ! it s not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly ( and i mean constantly ! ) , but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged . perhaps if one character were foul mouthed , but in this film , everybody swears nearly every other word . money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett ( played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker ) . franklin is your typical con-man and ends up with more than one person out to get him . when the plot finally gets underway , there s no less than three people ( or groups ) that want him , dead or alive . the frenchman who s somewhat responsible for franklin s escape from a prisoner-packed bus , a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand , and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder . franklin s only hope : james russell ( charlie sheen ) , an investigative reporter for the local news who s out to prove himself a worthy journalist . james offers to help clear franklin s name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week . both of these elements are completely lost along the way however , and never do reappear . as expected , the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end , which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way . there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film , and so many developments are either non-relevant , or just plain forgotten about . money talks is a paint-by-numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience . frivilous dialogue , a predictable , flat storyline , and two-dimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money .

negativeC,' director :   woody allen cast :   hank azaria , kenneth branagh , judy davis , leonardo dicaprio , melanie griffith , famke janssen , michael lerner , joe mantegna , winona ryder , charlize theron , dylan baker , screenplay :   woody allen producer :   jean doumanian runtime :    113 min . us distribution : miramax rated r :   language , sex , drug use copyright 1998 nathaniel r . atchesonif you re going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ? if you re going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? while watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people . what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation . celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he s familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows . allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more . branagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery . the usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another . unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it s not likely that you ll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity . aside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless . branagh proves once again that he s a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly . the problem is that he s the same character allen always plays , a character who s getting more than a little dull to watch . i mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ? -- he hates his work , and he can t be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved . he brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he s receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it s pretty hard to care about him . in addition , isn t allen capable of creating characters who aren t just like him ? i know he is , but he didn t do it in celebrity . the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances . davis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie . some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they re not likable people . only famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon s new novel , has any life . the men in the picture don t do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging . what s really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its " themes " are . allen seems to think that he s making an insightful movie about the way " normal " people look at celebrities . the main problem with this is that the character with whom we re supposed to identify , simon , is not a " normal " guy -- he s just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters . the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic , interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue . in addition , allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin , in this scene , says something like , " it s interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! " ) . celebrity is arguably allen s biggest misfire to date . it does have a few good scenes -- theron s super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two . but celebrity is a failure at the core , unless allen s point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends . if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke , then he succeeded in that . i , for one , don t enjoy feeling like an outsider .

negativeC,' mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival . as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival . it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . something else is what he did . the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life . she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep . meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada . she wants to build a career as an actress . betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow . she does not know who the woman is . she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is . they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not . meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own . he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) . these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong . there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion . in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits . a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun . lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film . he just chooses not to . as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason . there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches . the film is a little long for the subject matter . toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot . unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers . i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to + 4 scale . mulholland drive spoiler warning . i have rated this film fairly low . you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film . david lynch is in large part a dark satirist . most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside . in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . the audience expectation is that they will add up . but he has given clues that are self-contradictory . lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . mad magazine called it a poiuyt . other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . look at small portions of it and makes sense . look at the whole figure and it does not . this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar .

negativeC,' directed by mark tarlov . cast : sarah michelle gellar , sean patrick flanery , patricia clarkson , christopher durang , larry gilliard jr . , dylan baker , betty buckley . 1999 - 95 minutes . rated pg-13 ( for profanity ) . reviewed february 6 , 1999 . blatantly borrowing elements from 1993 s " like water for chocolate " and 1991 s " the butcher s wife , " " simply irresistible " attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy but , more often than not , comes off as laughable , leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar ( t . v .  s " buffy , the vampire slayer " ) would choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on . things get off to a bad start right from the onset as amanda ( sarah michelle gellar ) , a young woman who runs her late family s struggling new york restaurant , runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs on her and then vansihes into thin air . while out shopping , she also meets tom ( sean patrick flanery ) , a charming , handsome man , who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the department store he works for , and later when he decides to drop by her dive , called southern cross , for lunch , she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him , even though she is known to not be a very good chef . suddenly , amanda finds her restaurant , on the edge of foreclosure , rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food , which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths . are amanda and tom destined to be together ? and is it not just because of the magical food , but because they really , truly like each other ? and what exactly is going on with the food she is making ? does it have anything to do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food preparation ? " simply irresistible " is a ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic fantasy that s as flimsy as a slice of bologna . it takes one joke---that people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways---and recycles it over and over again until the film has reached an appropriate running time of 95 minutes . add in a music montage every ten minutes ( these are actually the best scenes in the movie , which certainly tells you something about the film itself ) , and what you ve got is an utterly empty , if not necessarily boring , excursion . the cast of " simply irresistible " is fairly good , but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting . patricia clarkson ( 1998 s " high art , " in which she played a drugged-out lesbian ) is a standout as tom s colleague , and is thankfully given a few funny lines of dialogue . also of note is larry gilliard jr . , as amanda s cooking assistant and buddy , who is allowed to create a seemingly full character out of only a handful of scenes . of the main stars , sarah michelle gellar is fine , but really does often look like she s struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material , and if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future , he has certainly got to pick better projects than this . the bottom line is that " simply irresistible " is the exact opposite of its deprophesized title , and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in mid-air ( an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid last scene ) , my mind checked out from the characters and the romance . when i think about it in hindsight , i should have checked out in the very first scene , where the point of the action was for gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical crab . now , that certainly is what i d call magical ! - copyright 1999 by dustin putmam http : //hometown . aol . com/filmfan16/index . html '

" wrongfully accused " meshes together the premises of " the fugitive " and " patriot games , " casting its always game star as ryan harrison ( get it ? ) , a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress ( kelly le brock ) . she , however , sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband ( michael york ) - a crime actually committed by a one-armed , one-legged , one-eyed man ( aaron pearl ) . harrison is arrested , found guilty and sentenced to death , but escapes from a prison bus , of course , and then is pursued by a determined u . s . marshal named fergus falls ( richard crenna , unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones  already smirky oscar-winning role ) . there s also a mystery brunette ( melinda mcgraw ) and an assassination subplot involving the u . n . secretary general , but like any of it matters . " wrongfully accused " gets off to an assured start , with an in-concert nielsen , touted " lord of the violin " by bare-chested posters , pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo-clad mosh in front of the stage . nice touch . most of the scenes that follow , however , never top the opener . ( hysterical exceptions : the mentos and " baywatch " goofs . ) movie parodies are crammed in at an almost-subliminal rate , but most are empty . when a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la " anaconda " or baseball players disappear into a " field of dreams " -esque cornfield , there s really nothing to laugh at . other moments , like an interlude in a fishing shop , are so unfocused that you re not sure what you re supposed to be laughing at . there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send-ups here , so it s possible that director/writer pat proft , by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two , guarantees something is sure to stick . and what does stick sticks well , particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard-boiled dialogue , what those " naked gun " s ( which proft collaborated on ) did great ; these bits are so on-target that they allow you to remember " wrongfully accused " as an almost-halfway-there spoof instead of a lame-brained failure . the movie might have been cursed to begin with , opening fast on the heels of " mafia ! " , from proft colleague jim abrahams , and " baseketball , " from proft colleague david zucker , but it s a strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing " wrongfully accused " of being nielsen s funniest . © 1998 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/ " the plot of jungle 2 jungle  has been removed from a french film called little indian , big city .   the operation was a failure and the patient dies .

negativeC,' susan granger s review of " jeepers creepers " ( mgm/ua entertainment ) this nasty , little horror film begins as a bickering brother ( justin long ) and sister ( gina philips ) are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped-up bodies down a drainage pipe . when long decides to investigate , there s nothing but trouble . " you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it ? - well , this is it ! " philips warns . what he finds in the basement of an old , abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying , jagged-stitched incision from his neck to his navel , plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies , stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry . long flees but now the monstrous , winged creeper ( jonathan breck ) is after both of them ! eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle , a psychic who explains the evil creature s bizarre feeding habits . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " jeepers creepers " is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion , giving new meaning to the old song " jeepers creepers . " and now - as paul harvey would say - for the rest of the story . what s more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer/director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 year-old actor in california . sentenced to three years in prison , he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992 . when salva made " powder " ( 1995 ) , the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities , disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile . and now , once again , in this mgm/ua film , that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio .

( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog , though -- something that s rarely seen in movies these days . ) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a " bad movie " sort of way , but that s a dubious distinction . ultimately , it s an unfortunate effort , for , while it isn t unbearable to sit through , it isn t a howl , either .

negativeC,' `bats  is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan . to pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines . something like the underground worm thriller `tremors  had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun . with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , `bats  mainly plays it s premise for straight-arrow horror . judging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move . the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock s `the birds  , but fails miserably . done right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema . unfortunately , `bats  is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong . the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be . i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats  is aimed toward . those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats . these bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people . boy , are these bats ugly . they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart . they ve got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all . a whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats . they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it s sorta hard to do . the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good . but no , `bats  is probably too violent for pre-schoolers . the film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores . on the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations . but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude . even the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed . the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc . . . ) . the scientist is dr . sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field  . meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable , but everything about dr . casper is recycled beyond recognition . her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper s tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws  . everything revolving around `bats  is tired drivel , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up . the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw , with voices dubbed in later . in fact , that may have worked out better in the end . take one glance at casper s bat-loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) , and you ll have immediate deja vu - he s the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie , constructed specifically for timed comic relief . unfortunately , none of his comic interludes are funny . in the role of deranged mad scientist dr . mccabe , the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch . mccabe `accidentally  released two experimental test subjects , and the virus spread to other bats . the entire town of gallup , texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures , but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else . something like : `when is the damn movie going to be over ? ? i just want my money .   the bats are ugly , i must say . there s the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing , but mainly , the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery . only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been , but by the absurdly stupid climax , it s way too late in the game for a decent recovery . characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire . let s explore the logic there : is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population ? ? you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one , and after that there are only 18 , 000 more of them . this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind `bats  .

" so when she catches her hot man dancing at a bar with a smart and sexy rival , gabrielle union , she devises her own version of " the rules , " a 10-day " tough love " emotionally punishing plan to get him back . unfortunately , writer/director mark brown ( " how to be a player " ) breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy : you have to like the protagonist - and shrill , self-congratulatory shante smith is a smirking , superficial , spiteful shrew who doesn t realize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love . having her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the " day one , " " day two " title-card device underscores the tedium . comic anthony anderson scores as chestnut s boisterous best-friend , and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic who s given a smooth makeover by ms . robinson . but the out-takes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " two can play that game " is smarmy if slick 4 , filled with misogynistic attitude and blatant product placements ( coca-cola , miller genuine draft ) but little else . in this r-rated ( for explicit sexual language ) , pseudo-hip battle of the sexes , the audience loses .

negativeC,' the word `unfilmable  is often bandied about over cult classic books . that never stops people from filming them . witness the english patient , which turned out to be filmable after all . and then there was fear and loathing in las vegas , which wasn t . but maybe unfilmable is the wrong word . breakfast of champions might have proved filmable , but it sure isn t watchable . this , of course , saddens me greatly . kurt vonnegut is my favorite author ever , and breakfast of champions was his first book that i read . it made enough of an impression for me to track down his entire oeuvre , which i have devoured . this film just shouldn t have been made , sadly . take cat s cradle ( his second-best work ) next time  that ought to make a great film . why is this breakfast so bad ? because the book is about craziness . dwayne hoover ( willis ) is a crazy auto salesman , married to a crazy wife ( hershey ) , and he becomes obsessed with a crazy sci-fi writer named kilgore trout ( finney ) . trout s sales manager ( nolte ) is also a crazy guy that likes to dress in women s lingerie , and his secretary ( headley ) isn t all together . oh , and trout s son ( haas ) wants to be a lounge singer named bunny . what made the book so good is that you can go inside these characters , heads , plus vonnegut s writing style is so nutty that it all actually works . director rudolph tries to do this , too , with wacky camera angles , digital effects , and other tricks , but none of this works . in fact , it s just annoying and is barely entertaining for even a minute . a couple of wisecracks aside , this breakfast is unedible .

negativeC,' " virus " is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it . strangely enough , on the same mid-january weekend last year , another film was released like this , " deep rising , " about an ugly monster on a cruise liner . prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989 s " leviathan , " 1989 s " deep star six , " and all four " alien " pictures . " virus , " in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn t include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on . based on a series of comic books , " virus " concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon . after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen . once the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted . after turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship , and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself . one survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) , who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out . if " virus " sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies , you re correct . although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life , the film itself doesn t appear to have a brain in its head . the film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the " creature " genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film . the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past , but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play . in her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it . although 1998 s " halloween : h20 " was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here . donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994 s " the puppet masters , " although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic " invasion of the body snatchers , " where he was fabulous . the last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do . basically , " virus " is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one . it is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ? as long as some of them keep making money , i suspect the answer is never . - copyright 1999 by dustin putman http : //hometown . aol . com/filmfan16/index . html '
negativeC,' adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy , the wedding singer . unfortunately , that also has the effect of softening his edge . he s nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore , not that it was much of one . he s certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot . the year is 1985 , letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia . adam sandler is nice guy robbie , the titular wedding singer , who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits . robbie s life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee , linda ( angela featherstone ) , leaves him at the altar . however , things are looking up when he meets julia ( drew barrymore ) , a waitress at the hall . she s the perfect woman , but for one small flaw : she s engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king , glenn ( matthew glave ) . so , most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love , and his attempts to stop the wedding . as far as plots go , it s a pretty thin and tired one . to fill the gaps , the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia . from boy george to michael jackson , from miami vice to dallas , from the first cds to the last rubik s cubes , this film revels in all the minutiae . and then there s the music . . . learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank , and romy and michele s high school reunion , this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow . as a result , most songs get maybe a lyric or a half , but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives  eyes : the wedding singer vols . 2 , 3 , and 4 ! while the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring , at least they distract you from the plot . at least last year s my best friend s wedding stirred up the standard " keep your true love from marrying someone else " plot by making the rival a nice person . here , glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what julia saw in him . barrymore , on the other hand , is simply charming as julia . which leaves us with adam sandler . he s at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little ( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception ) . when he s in full nice-guy mode , he s more pathetic than endearing . the film boasts several cameos ( most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz ) . but none of them work well at all . buscemi s role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous . lovitz , on the other hand , as a rival wedding singer , makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live , where he was actually funny . the only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker during the film s finale ( surprisingly , one of the only plot-related scenes which actually works . ) adam sandler still has some work to do before he can become a dependable leading man . while he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer , the end result is no net gain .

negativeC,' part buddy comedy , part fish-out-of-water story , part nature tale , meet the deedles is not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes . in fact , it is an invitation you ought to disregard . phil and stew deedle ( paul walker and steve van wormer ) are the twin sons of the famous millionaire , elton deedle ( eric braeden ) , founder of deedle enterprises . elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his fortune . . . instead the two are careless hawaiian surf bums . to set them straight , he enrolls them into a strict wyoming boot camp , to which the pair inevitably go . after several misadventures in wyoming , where the duo is stunned to discover there s no surf , the brothers deedle stumble upon a routine mistaken identity plot . they arrive at yellowstone national park , where they are believed to be two new park ranger recruits . rather than slinking back home and disappointing their dad , the deedles play along . phil , actually , has other motives : the beautiful park ranger jesse ( a . j . langer ) , who unfortunately happens to be the beloved stepdaughter of the overprotective park ranger captain douglas pine ( john ashton ) . yellowstone has a problem . it s only a week before the famous geyser old faithful celebrates its one billionth birthday , and the park is being overrun with prairie dogs . not just one or two . . . thousands of them . the deedles are assigned to eliminate the p . dog menace , not knowing that it all is part of a fiendish plan by disgraced former head ranger frank slater ( dennis hopper ) . the brothers deedle aren t supposed to be out-and-out stupid , like the team from dumb and dumber , or bill and ted . instead , their brains just operate in a different , simpler , realm . a more accurate comparison would be with carrot top in chairman of the board , a film which , unfortunately , this one resembles in several hideous ways . the central problem with meet the deedles is that it simply just isn t funny . there s a moment when phil utters the line , " insert laugh here " , which nearly sums up the entire meet the deedles experience . the result isn t bad in a run-shrieking-from-the-theater type of way . instead , it s merely bad in an excruciatingly boring sort of way . the cast seems decent , but they re never asked to do anything remotely interesting . instead , the film inundates the audience with countless shots of people and/or cars rolling downhill in the forest , and with constant annoying references to other disney films . you ll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf in wyoming than finding entertainment in meet the deedles .

negativeC,' it happens every year -- the days get longer , the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big-budget blockbusters . this year s crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997 s lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world . the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( " heeere , lee-zerd , lee-zerd . . . " ) , which doesn t make me optimistic about future summers . godzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner-owned cable stations . that this big-budget remake won t rise above its roots is fairly obvious . the credits show us the origin of godzilla . in five words : nuclear explosion creates giant lizard . sounds like an enquirer headline , doesn t it ? the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable " discovery " sequence . this time , a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling ( if that ain t a stereotype . . . ) when he discovers the telltale radar blip . people die . cut to our protagonist , played by matthew broderick . he makes his first appearance wearing headphones , warbling along to " singin  in the rain . " it s a none-too-subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie . no dice , bueller . from the beginning , poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla s enormous footprint . every disaster movie has to have a know-it-all scientist , and this time broderick is it . as the world s leading expert on radiated earthworms ( and wouldn t you love to have that printed on your business card ? ) , broderick is invaluable to the government . he immediately dispels vicki lewis  theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because , hey , you can t take seriously the intellectual arguments of " newsradio " cast members . broderick instead hits the nail on the head , announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard . " the radiation isn t an anamoly , " he announces , and lightning strikes . " i believe this is a mutated abberation , " he continues , and lightning strikes again . it s vocabulary lightning , you see , activated by words of four syllables or more . meanwhile , we re introduced to our new york cast , headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist ( maria patillo ) , broderick s former love . gee , what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time ? poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer . italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she s not ruthless enough : " nice doesn t get you anywhere in this town . it s dog eat dog . " actually , it s lizard eat city , as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple s core . the filmmakers provide us with a one-note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla . " i think i ve got a bite , " he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him . you can guess what happens next . similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city . hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps , one new yorker remarks , " please don t tell me that s another parade . " please don t tell me that s the best line you could come up with . mayor ebert is not pleased . played by the principal from " head of the class , " he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option , and bickers with his assistant gene . i guess the filmmakers knew they d be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didn t even bother to kiss ass . the problem is , if you re going to attack siskel and ebert , you should at least make it funny . dialogue like , " didn t we agree that we weren t going to have any sweets until after the election ? " followed by , " back off , gene , " just doesn t work for me . other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character s last name and frenchman jean reno s inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york . there s even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses . as the beast heads back into hiding , broderick suggests the military lure it out with food . cue twelve dump trucks , all dropping fish into a new york intersection . ( broderick : that s a lot of fish . ) that ambush fails , but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying $50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them . yep , godzilla s with children , which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla . that s until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually , like linda tripp . godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day , so it has a lot of dumb action scenes , destructive special effects and shallow subplots . look no further than patillo s betrayal of broderick ( patillo : what have i done , animal ? what have i become ? ) and the climactic " godzilla s nest " sequence in madison square garden . the main difference is , independence day was about the experience . it had a real global , patriotic element to it , and some genuinely fun characters . godzilla has lots of rain and lightning , reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak , blockbuster , juicy fruit , swatch , sprint and bumble bee tuna . yes , bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla . that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie . visit the movie critic at large homepage at http : //www . missouri . edu/~c667778/movies . html close to 1 , 000 reviews with a comedic flair . . .

" jermaine shares his desire with co-worker terrence ( smith ) , who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter . the woman , jade ( palmer ) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine . jade , at one point was a college student , too . unlike jasmine , she found herself pregnant , dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet . to further reinforce their differences , it s revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son . inevitably , through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaine s part , the forbidden act is consummated . the aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaine s property with the hint that the violence may escalate . by this point , trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama : a fatal attraction without the social significance . the exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical . jermaine comes off as insincere , sexually driven and selfish . jasmine is bland and subservient . jade comes off a bit sympathetically , but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy . yet another tale of a sexually aggressive " dog " of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating , innocent mate . the last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve , but by this point , will you even care ? if the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending , perhaps there could have been some freshness to it . as it stands , trois is pretty standard fare .

( don t ask ) . i ll skip the itinerary . by going to a legal , open-to-the-public island neighboring their destination , the idiot three manage to swim the waters leading to paradise . the first thing they see is an immensity of cannabis plants . the second is a bunch of sinister , heavily armed locals , whom they evade . next stop is a commune of perhaps two dozen non-angels . they live --or so they think -- an idyllic life , are sort of self-sufficient ( but not really ) , play a lot , do soccer , cricket , smoke dope by the ton , tattoo themselves and presumably have mucho sex . but there are no scenes of copulation . and rather coyly , hardly any male or female naked bodies ( where it matters ) . it  s no topless french riviera . absent too are : aids , pregnancies , doctors , dentists , condoms , you name it . from the air ( don t ask ) the island looks like a lamb chop . i don t think this symbolizes anything . newcomers and resident aliens are all constantly dumfounded by the scenic beauty of the place . there is even a waterfall whose top comes in handy for a butch cassidy mega-jump . they commune-ists have made a deal with local peasants ( the heavily armed guys ) who live off the lucrative sea of grass : the foreigners can stay , but never , never add new people to the commune . why the locals have settled for this arrangement makes no sense . the commune is sort of led by a gal called sal . not particularly pretty , thirty-something , therefore older than the other womens , she is the top ( and sole ) authority . the three new people are accepted . richard and francois become a twosome , to the detriment of her french lover etienne . richard becomes a hero for battling and killing a shark . ( a kill-joy point out it was a mere baby shark ) . he makes a dumb " philosophical " speech about sharks and how to face them . ( do not try this at home or underwater ) . all is hunky-dory , except that bugs ( note the cartoonishness of names - pure infantilism ) . who is sal s man , does not like richard who in turn mistrusts him . lisa takes off for one her periodical trips to the nearest town , called something like kopenyang . i can t remember . she asks for richard to go with her . the commune people order all sorts of things , from vittels to body oil to cigarettes to tampons and more . fact is too that the town is full of sleazy youths of all sexes , from the west ( or the east , if you think of america ) who are carousing , dancing , making out , drinking and doping . richard calls his folks , at home . where does the shopping money come from ? never mind . coincidence ! it goes without saying that you ve been expecting it . the two boys for whom richard left a copy of the famous map are there , with two girls . how to prevent them from going to paradise ? never mind . richard and somewhat spinsterish-looking sal have sex . it is prudishly shown on a tent s surface like chinese shadows . here comes the great line of this cinematic masterpiece . sal , about to go to sleep , tells richard to do the same " because tomorrow morning i may want some more sex . " the island starts becoming paradise lost upon ther return from the shopping trip . francoise smells a sexual rat ( r & s ) , is not pleased . richard lies . someone has a terrible problem with a tooth . ( or perhaps that was before the trip ? ) two or three men are attacked by sharks . a survivor , horribly mauled , disturbs the happy family with his cries . of agony . so they put him in distant corner of the beach and resume their fun and games . in spite of abundant christian symbolism ( prayers , crosses , etc . ) the men and women are totally self-centered . ( richard s compassion will however , illustrate his humanity . after all , he is leonardo ) . the two couples with the map s copy camp across the water . they are a dangerous no-no . sal mercilessly orders richard to guard the beach , keep an eye on the potential intruders , keep them away no matter at what cost . richard , alone in his outpost , goes bananas , hallucinates , eat a bug , has visions , also goes native a la kurtz in " apocalypse now , " a film referred to more than once . but he is a sub-kurtz . the four kids raft over . the farmers with automatic weapons take care of them . oh , the horror , the horror . but worry not . an exodus from paradise finds mr . dicaprio alive and well -- well , alive anyway -- and ready for another astronomic paycheck . this movie about post-hippie retards is ludicrous and unpleasant . the exotic photography is fine . the music is not . it loads on generic-romantic sounds which come up on the least provocation . it s like the experienced person who gave this advice to a new director : " whenever you don t know what to do , throw in the hallelujah chorus from handel s " the messiah .

" anyone who s seen this film can back me up on this : this is the worst of the " great " disaster films , and that s not really saying a lot for this film . " earthquake " is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured . on video , it s a bland and slow-moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters ( the disaster film requisite ) , then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster . while this worked in , say , " the towering inferno , " it doesn t here for one single reason : we don t care about any of the characters . the film gives us charlton heston ( in one of many crap 70s films he made , including " skyjacked " and that classic , " soylent green " ) as a rich man married to ava gardner , who is having a little affair with a young single mom ( genieveve bujold ) ; a renegade police officer on suspension ( george kennedy , in his least humored performance ) ; in the second weirdest subplot , a motorcycle stuntman ( richard roundtree , right after his " shaft " thing ) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down ( yea , snore ) ; and the weirdest subplot : a military man/bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal , and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair ( ! ! ! ) . in smaller subplots , there s a pointless bit about people who are flying over l . a . ( the city in the film , by the way ) , one who s playing cards and married to a boring non-acting husband ( you think this one can go nowhere ? guess again . he gets interested in the final frames ) ; there s genieveve bujold s moron son , who has a little adventure with wires ; and for some much-needed comedy , there s walter matthau ( billed as walter mutha . . . . - the only laugh in the film ) , as a wild drunkard , who s big moment is a dance he does at a critical time . as for the actual " earthquake , " it s rather a let-down . there s a full hour of character-setups , none of which is interesting , then about 10 minutes of shaking , crumbling , and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold ( narrowly missing ) . this film needed that whole theatre-shaking : they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored . there s little suspense following the quake , although this film tries for it . there s an adventure in a crumbling high-rise office building , the wires with the kid , and the movement of people who are all injured . but none of these are all-too suspenseful . the finale with the heston/gardner/bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flip-of-the-coin bit , which brings out a big let-down . and there s no real finale . even " volcano " ended nicely , and that movie really sucked . not only is it hokey , but you don t care about any character . who cares if heston dies ? who cares if he choses bujold or gardner ( although i would have chosen gardner , mainly on the basis that she can actually act ) ? who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid " stunt ? " who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires ? and who cares about that whole plane spiel ? if anything , " earthquake " is worth a viewing for the same reason " glen or glenda ? " is . i mean , i laughed at this more than i did at " bio dome . " but that s another story ( and review ) . in short , " earthquake " gives disaster pics a bad name . '

" a la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life . beck s wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children . she will not even allow him to wish them " merry christmas " by telephone . but beck s family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang . beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop . his investigation starts in l . a . and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp . virtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective . the plot is incoherent and full of holes . the movie depicts beck s investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions . the action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense . i certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii . in all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction . dead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting . according to the movie s production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck . you would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable . most of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above . william forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who s offended by beck s foul language and unorthodox methods . forsythe s lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable . dead-bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( " wkrp in cincinnati " and " frank s place " ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains . the sole function of penelope ann miller s character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less . i guess the film s title refers to this love scene since it s definitely a dead bang . the only real virtue of dead-bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie s pitiful script . johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life . and i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments . the funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him . but when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie s in trouble . the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen . but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make .

" hanging up " is not the worst movie i have ever seen , but it is the only one i can think of that made me want to pull out a gun and start shooting at the images onscreen . it s a horrible experience , as if somebody had discovered my pet peeves and decided to devote a whole film to winding me up . although i own a cellphone and am acquainted with whiny women , they are both things i detest , and for emergencies only . watching them for 95 minutes is not my idea of a good time . the film is supposed to be the story of a man s family reacting to his descent into death . it s actually just an irritating bunch of phone conversations between three witless sisters , who might actually develop personalities if they cancelled their at&t subscriptions and lived in the real world . meg ryan plays eve , the one who stays by her father s hospital bed , deals with his eruptions of dementia , and calls up everyone else , trying to get them to visit him . maddy ( lisa kudrow ) , the youngest sibling , is an insecure little tramp who complains that nobody will take her seriously ; she doesn t think it odd that at age 29 she was still dreaming of becoming a rock star , and in her mid-30s she expects she s going to be an actress . georgia ( diane keaton ) , the eldest , is smarmy , dishonest and lies about her personal life when it will bring her gain . so much of " hanging up " takes place on the phone , with the annoying trio barking insipid platitudes down receivers , that when i left the cinema my ears were still ringing from clicks , beeps and dial tones . perhaps this movie was inevitable , such is contemporary society s obsession with telecommunication . delia and nora ephron , who wrote the screenplay , and diane keaton , the director , seem to think this presentation of people is normal , and that s rather sad . worse is the grating nature of the performances . keaton plays her detestable character with the kind of glee that shoves right into our faces and makes us want to scream . ryan is unconvincing , because she uses the same disorganised comic presence as in " when harry met sally " and " joe versus the volcano " , and expects it to work when her character is supposed to be a cornerstone of emotional stability . as for lisa kudrow , well , she s a joke , who exudes stupidity from all of her phoney body , dead eyes , and flat , sarcastic whimper of a voice . you know when you re on a crowded train , and you re wedged into the window seat when three other people need to sit in the same booth as you ? " hanging up " is a lot like that , as long as the three people are vapid yuppie bitches whining and crying about their boyfriends and families into mobile telephones that play a little tune when they ring . this is a film that could get gandhi s blood boiling . if it becomes your wife s favourite video , no sane jury will convict you of domestic abuse . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantgani please visit , and encourage others to visit , the uk critic s website , which is located at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic '

negativeC,'  note : this review contains one or two of those words some people get upset over . read at your own risk . except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy , that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through . bette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan , actress and author , once married , now violently divorced , and back together one last time for their daughter molly s ( paula marshall ) wedding . lilly and dan hate each other passionately -- so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again . each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the other . molly , married now only 24 hours , runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith ( jamie denton ) tries to console the abandoned spouses . in molly s search for her parents , she somehow falls in love with lilly s paparazzo joey ( danny nucci ) . meanwhile , the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan s wife rowena ( gail o grady ) in bed . the audience i saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious . i m no dan quayle , but i thought it was a bit creepy . the message seemed to be " ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish . " " family values " aside , there s something cruel about all this . perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy , but the movie is a romantic comedy . we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps . reiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable . lilly s husband is a new-age flake who rambles about " emotional valet parking , " so we can write him off as irrelevant . dan s wife is vain , manipulative , and jealous so we can write her off as a bitch . molly s husband is a career-conscious , self-centered republican politician who thinks she s too fat ( and just for good measure , he also fucked dan s wife ) , so we can write him off as a prick . everyone else falls in love . but still , that somehow doesn t justify the actions of the movie s main characters . " he s a prick " or " she s a bitch " is no defense . the movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog -- often during heated arguments -- and by above-average performances by midler and farina ( breaking out of his character-actor mold ) . other than that , it s a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes '

" i mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned production that made me smile . based on an incredibly popular video game , " lara croft : tomb raider " is a lousy movie . the structure goes like this : poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , etc . etc . , the end . basically , the film exists to showcase angelina jolie s puffy lips and enhanced tits . close-ups are framed oh-so-carefully to include her million dollar bazooms . running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage " baywatch " fashion . there s even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them . but the filmmakers are so inept they can t even flash the audience correctly . the one extended display of nudity is of - get ready for this - a guy . for no particular reason , a muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds , with each shot composed to barely cover his package , à la " austin powers . " now , i enjoy a good looking male body as much as the next gay guy , but what the hell is beefcake doing in a t&a flick aimed at heterosexual males ? of course , what else should one expect in a film that does virtually nothing right ? " tomb raider " sets up elaborate action set pieces , then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing ( a promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts ) . it promises a series of exotic locales , then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies . throw in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons . intended to be a rousing " indiana jones " style adventure , " tomb raider " lacks any sense of tension . the low point comes when lara is " threatened " by statues of monkey warriors and a giant multi-armed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi . easily the lamest menaces i have ever seen , the creatures move like snails and fall apart with a single shot from a gun . if you ever have to be chased by monsters , pray that you get the monkey warriors . " tomb raider " tells a story , sort of . once every 5 , 000 years , the planets align . a group of very bad men are out to find two halves of an object that , if reassembled just as the planets align , will give them control over time itself . lara s goal is to stop them and rescue her long-missing poppa ( jon voight , jolie s real life dad ) . none of this matters though , because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of " lara croft : tomb raider " is as lame as ever other aspect of the film  except angelina jolie s lips and breasts .

( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . ) they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user s answer to deep impact . bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond " zero barrier " and destroys our planet . why an oil driller ? they require someone experienced with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid . ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his own blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it . we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids ? ) harry assembles the obligatory " ragtag " bunch of " cowboys " , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) . once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes . whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal . nor will you care . i will say this : you know you re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope . willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck . their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material . steve buscemi s character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic . " rockhound " , as he s called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film . so why did they bring him up there to begin with ? rather , why write him into the film ? -give his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . i m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father s band s ( " aerosmith " ) songs grace the soundtrack . director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen . ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate s brain . ) whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out " we lost ( insert dead person s last name here ) ! " i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses  faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework . it has a vivid soundmix . but at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever . bollocks ! the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler . remember a little film called jaws ? in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . they didn t much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . one of jaws  great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before " action " was called . a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don t bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery . to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn t build a birdhouse . and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life .

negativeC,' " tina ! ! ! fetch me the axe ! ! ! " a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands . it wasn t just the film s disappointing box office performance . indeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times . no , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year . in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : " mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! " . executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late . mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history . unfortunately , faye dunaway s energetic , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film s only redeeming feature . based on daughter christina crawford s trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother . if you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania . the film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother s will . joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see . but that s about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film s end . the script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum . frank perry s direction is no more than competent , and dunaway s bitchy lines aside , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving . in fairness , the film s second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters . when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina s own acting and career ambitions . crawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain . you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers . ah , but there is dunaway s performance . and what a delicious piece of campery it often is . having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds , crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden . she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she s making . spotting a young tree she doesn t like the look of , she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line " tina ! ! fetch me the axe ! ! " with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling . in the film s most outrageous scene , joan realises that some of her daughter s clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers . oh dear ! sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum , doesn t it ? this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst : " no . . . wire . . . hangers . . . . ever ! ! ! ! " . and later , when the board of her late husband s company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship , she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring : " don t fuck with me , fellas ! ! " . oh joy ! something of a camp classic , then , but if that s not you re cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn t have too much to recommend it . better you see the real crawford in the women ( 1939 ) , mildred pierce ( 1945 ) or whatever happened to baby jane ( 1962 ) . great films distinguished by great performances , and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry s shrieking piece of tabloid froth .

negativeC,' by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . i love ralph fiennes . i love uma thurman . i love sean connery . hell , i m even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . the film i saw today didn t even meet those expectations . this is a lousy , incoherent mess . i would slam it harder , if it weren t for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired . that s the main problem with the avengers : for all it s hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . it s like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making . it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . this is just plain depressing . the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i ve never watched an episode . i wasn t alive then . i don t even watch television now . i m very sorry that i don t have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i ve already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse . i didn t know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . they are to work together , under mother s orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) . it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . his name is de wynter ( connery ) . he is a crazy scottish guy . our heroes had better stop him , or else . . . the weather will keep getting colder until they " have to go to hell to warm up " ( one of the film s few funny lines ) . along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense . for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . now , killer bugs don t really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film . the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . they re never even directly connected to de wynter ( they re controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . the special effects aren t bad , but they re loud , obnoxious , and intrusive . like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . and i guarantee you , it will wane . i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn t do any good to think . the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn t tell us what happens . there are several scenes in the preview that didn t make the final cut . in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) . the scenes that don t feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . they aren t . the action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . they aren t , either . and what about this wasted cast ? oh , it makes me weep with disappointment . we re talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . i love the guy . i ve loved all his films , until this one . he seems like he wants to understand the film , but he s as lost as we are . and thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can t manage to look at home here . ( i don t blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . ) connery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter . who is to blame ? is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . is it the actors ? for god s sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling . i blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn t have been given the task to begin with . his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . add to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory . if the avengers has a saving grace , it s the set design . the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . i like the final set-piece , on de wynter s island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense . i admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . i also enjoyed michael kamen s music score , particularly in the opening credits . but this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there s a lot more that needs to be here . inspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . or a sense of purpose . most of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . damn this movie for not giving them the chance .

negativeC,' there are some actors that you just look at and will automatically see them as the famous character they play . fran drescher will forever will the nanny , bob denver will always be gilligan , and don knotts lives forever as barney fife . all these people are television actors who appear on their show , week after week playing the same character , so it is hard for this to translate into celebrities who appear in movies . anthony hopkins on the other hand apparently wants us to always think of him as a crazed madman behind bars . this is the only reason i could come up with for him to take the leading role in instinct , a new movie that re-defines cliched and painful . it does not matter if the prison inmates are tough praying on the few weak ones , or that the guards give new meaning to police brutality . you could probably withstand all of the above material on a good bucket of popcorn and a very large soda . but the movie can t even be even fun and smart on a summer movie level , and fails miserably to make us excited or scared in any way . dr . theo calder is a young psychologist who is very high in the areas of self-confidence and self-assurance . he wants to begin seeing a crazed scientist who recently was transported from a prison in africa to one in the states . ethan powell ( hopkins , playing the role of hannibal lecterâs non-cannibal cousin ) was a scientist who disappeared in the forests of africa in 1994 . he lived in the forest with the gorillas he studies for two years before killing two park rangers and injuring two more while trying to protect his gorilla family . in the first interview theo learns some problems that may hinder the investigation of ethan . one , he doesn t speak to anyone at all . two , he hasn t experienced human interaction in so long he responds to almost everything with violent outbursts . three , the doctors at the prison just don t care . how dramatic , how thrilling , how ( inserting snoring sounds here ) . eventually he does get the man to finally utter a few words , but the psychiatrist soon finds himself to be the one whoâs being taught a lesson . thereâs some message about how no human actually has control , they just think they do , that is what powell teaches him . dr . calder soon expands his horizons as a realizes that is may not be the people in the prison , but the prison itself . the problems with the inmates must live with are guards that are not fair to them and treat them with harshly and violently . plus , oh my god ! everyone in the prison is not being treated with proper respect . ok , let us take a poll : who would ever really care about what happens to any of the people in this movie ? see it and if you donât come out disgusted then i will personally pay for your next outing to the cinema . ( note : the preceding sentence was just to prove a point that this movie is bad , i will not pay for your next movie so donât e-mail me asking for money . ) the acting in the film is just horrible . hopkins does nothing in the role that he is accustomed to , and cuba has some keen intellectual ability to pick bad roles that will make him lose his star status . this is not entirely the actorâs faults though . the script could easily have been written better if the proper time was taken with it . the soapy emotion that floats up near the end of the film also doesnât make any sense with all of the happenings in the beginning of the picture . the setting is uninteresting and the story has too many side plots that they do nothing with which just seem to be there to add to the running time . you could rip up all of the copies ( with gloves on so as not to burn your fingers ) of this movie at your local video store . you could warn people who try to rent it , or you could make a big bonfire and burn all of the copies in the neighborhood . whatever you can do to help make sure that no one on earth will ever have to experience this film ( i believe ) would be greatly appreciated by the american public . so if you havenât gotten the message yet , avoid instinct , which gets 1/2 a * . the young-uns : the film contains some suspenseful scenes and strong language . it is also senselessly brutal and violent in some scenes . good age : no one who is sober/anyone who liked chill factor a review by frankie paiva the 12 year-old movie reviewer e-mail me at swpstke@aol . com visit my website at http : //www . homestead . com/teenagemoviecritic/mainpage . html '

negativeC,' conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children s items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years after the item was made . that s when the kids of that time have jobs , disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives . check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you ll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks . there s a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen . boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work-a-day world for a long time . they d like to re-capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore . hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them . directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time . and for the most part they re messing it up . " mission impossible " , " lost in space " , " godzilla " , " zorro " . none of these successfully capture the originals . none of these are even good films . you can now add " the avengers " to the list . the british television series began in 1961 . super secret agent john steed ( then-patrick macnee ) and his third partner , emma peel ( then-diana rigg ) are the pair that the american audience fell for . surrealistic and witty , the series fit the mood of the times . the leather-clad rigg probably didn t hurt the ratings either . after all it s not a coincidence that you can t pronounce her character s name without " appeal " . now we re in the nineties . steed ( now-ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now-uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england s weather . that s about as much of a plot as we have . there s some footage about a lot of other things that either don t make sense or make even less sense . we get betrayal for some unknown reason . evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film . remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason . there s a high tech hot air balloon , but i have no idea why anyone s in it . the spy agency is run by a man called " mother " who is in a wheelchair and a woman named " father " who is blind . . . at least in some scenes . there s probably a reason for all of this , but we ll never know it . macnee makes an appearance of sorts . he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing . a group of villains sits around a table , all clad in huge pastel-colored teddy bear outfits . at first it s humorous to watch the teddies waddle around , but then it becomes goofy . the movie is a medley of clutter , confusion and wrong decisions around every corner . it feels like major portions of the film are missing . the storyline jumps rather than flows . reportedly the film was re-cut several times . this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing . there s one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher . other than that , the effects are second-rate . the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes . thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesn t work . she looks good , dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there s no spark . fiennes fares even less well . macnee s steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor . fiennes  agent comes across as a dour kid in grown-up clothes who has never been out of his home town . even connery , one of the greatest living actors , doesn t have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes . the action scenes are difficult to follow . director jeremiah chechik ( responsible for the atrocious remake of " diabolique " ) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn t be . things happen , people move around , but even if , with the utmost effort , you were able to care about any of it , the scenes are bewildering . the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads . witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination . admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film , but there s no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever . one of emma peel s first lines of dialog is " rules are made to be broken . " it doesn t get any better . advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone . the release date was changed several times . connery refuses to promote the film . there was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers . at least this way , they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out . admittedly i haven t seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades . my guess is that it would be severely dated now . no matter how antiquated it might be , there s no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing . there s no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie . no reason at all .

negativeC,' in 1970s , many european intellectuals , especially those on the left political hemisphere , became obsessed with the rise of fascism . which wasn t so hard to expect , because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies . in such times , when political involvement could be associated with noble passion , many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany . of course , there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other , less noble reasons . for them , moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era . which , naturally , made some of those films very popular among teen audience . one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass , who later made career shooting expensive , stylish soft porn . salon kitty , his 1976 film , is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern , book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2 . in 1939 , walter schellenberg , one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite , exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats . none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents , and that all the rooms happened to be bugged . the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty , nominal madame of the brothel , didn t know the real purpose of that enterprise . screenplay by tinto brass , of course , simplifies the story and changes few names . schellenberg is now wallenberg ( helmut berger ) , ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top . kitty kellerman ( ingrid thulin ) , apart from being madam , has a second job as a cabaret singer . caught in the net of depravity is sweet , innocent girl margerithe ( theresa ann savoy ) thrown into brothel . there she falls in love with customer hans reiter ( bekim fehmiu ) , disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe . when margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel , she finds out that the place is bugged . she informs the madam of the real situation , and both women decide to confront wallenberg . those who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film , that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation . but , although salon kitty doesn t happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn ( although not very successful ; some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing ) , it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict - this time between power-hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty . unfortunately , brass seems to overuse other cinematical references , probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino visconti s the damned , but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulin s unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minelli s musical numbers from cabaret . all in all , salon kitty is failure , although with some very interesting moments .

negativeC,' back in the early years of his career , eddie murphy was afflicted with what roger ebert termed " star magic syndrome " , where a hot young star is shoved blindly into one ill-conceived production after another , in the hopes that name-brand recognition will make up for shoddy writing or inept concepts . after the surefooted fun of doctor doolittle and the nutty professor , holy man is a step back to the golden child for murphy . murphy plays a guru/swami-type figure named g ( yes , just " g " -- [g]andhi ? [g]autama ? we never find out ) , whose idea of mysticism is parlor tricks and whose expoundings on philosophy are torn wholesale from sub-robert bly self-help books . he s the kind of character that desperately needs an edge , a twist . i kept thinking back to my own readings on zen buddhism , in which the masters slapped their disciples around mercilessly , insulted them , posed impossible riddles , and did all kinds of other off-the-wall things in the name of enlightenment . no two ways about it : g is boring . g wanders into the lives of two tv execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston ) , who are the manufactured romance for the movie . they re a little unnerved by this guy , even when he repairs the flat tires on their car . every time they look at g , their faces seem to say something like : " what if he s one of those wackos who insinuates themselves into your life and kills your dog ? " now right there is something more interesting than anything that actually happens in the movie . see , the execs are in charge of a rapidly-failing home shopping network which hawks various utterly unsellable products . they desperately need to revamp things . one day , on a whim , g wanders onto the set and does his thing -- and suddenly , merchandise is blowing out the door ! this guy s a kick-butt salesman ! this leads to him getting his own show ( named , with agonizing predictability , " the g spot " ) . why isn t any of this funny ? probably because we can see it coming a billion miles away . nothing happens in this movies because it s human nature -- certainly not the cardboard romance , which has preston and goldblum fighting , making up and getting back together in scenes of leaden predictability . and g isn t a counterpoint to anything : he s his own straight man . he has a bunch of unedifying little speeches and one long one that s not only unedifying , but dishonest , because it s a parable that we ve heard way too many times before . the writer , tom schulman , has indulged in this kind of sappiness before . he penned the insufferable dead poets society , which indulged in the insincere fiction that poetry and writing need to be " sold " to students with flashy technique instead of cherished on their own . here , he s no better : he gives g nothing of importance to do , surrounds him with a setup that s bloodless and uninvolving , and fills his mouth with thimble-deep pop-psych blather . suggestions for the rewrite : either ditch the romance or make it more bloodthirsty . and as for g , give him some actual attitude instead of just a smile . here s one role where eddie murphy should actually have let the more scatological , scabrous side of his personality out of the closet . failing that , maybe they should have case chris tucker . he would have been funny just standing there in swami pajamas .

negativeC,' " goodbye , lover " sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may , and one look will tell you why . it s a mess . and that s * way * before ellen degeneres shows up . the film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters . i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller , one wrote a murder mystery , and one wrote a comedy , then director roland joffé tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment . i didn t laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to ) . degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair . either degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn t yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist . every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid . her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is " at least she died healthy . " and that s one of her wittier asides . degeneres  sgt . rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of . . . wait . to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple-crosses . it s best described this way : sultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake , a " creative yet unfocused " ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep , played by dermot mulroney . sandra likes to act out her deep-seated sexual fantasies and jake s brother ben ( the suave-as-ever don johnson ) likes to help . ben is also coming on to his petite , mousy co-worker peggy blaine ( mary-louise parker ) and someone , somewhere , is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his . the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again . although there are some genuine surprises , the plot twists get too contrived too quickly . probably around the time degeneres  gumcracking gumshoe appears . at least the former " ellen " star is going for something a little different . arquette turns in yet another of her stiletto-heeled , platinum blonde bombshell roles ( see : " lost highway , " " true romance " ) while quoting embarrassing lines like " i m not wearing any underwear . " i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this . here s an example of some of the film s flat-out stupidity . sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film s duplicitous lovers . she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite " the sound of music " on her car stereo , intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims . so what was the point of the wig and the car ? " the sound of music " stuff might be a reference to " the wizard of oz " allusions in david lynch s " wild at heart , " but if so joffé must have forgotten that " wild at heart " was a despicable movie . it s hard to believe that " goodbye , lover " was directed by the same person who made " the killing fields " and " the mission . " it s not , however , hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long . it should have stayed there . '

" oh yeah , i ve just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered , but hey , i ll crack jokes anyway . after all , it is in the script . the film s only saving graces are a few well-executed suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the " re-animator himself , jeffrey combs . he brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie . way to go , jeffrey . i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept it s head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson . with " scream " and even it s sequel , he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter . his ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers , and i think " i still know " has really suffered by not having him on board . the cool atmosphere is still there this time around , but i just didn t like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one . even though the movie doesn t have williamson , it still has a hacky ending , trying to do what kevin did with the first two " scream " s by ( some may consider this a spoiler , but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever , then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes ) having two killers and , this time , having one of them being a family member to the other . i think someone in the audience put it best when , after the movie had ended with another " the killer is back ! " cliffhanger , he said " who is this time , the grandma ? " all in all , " i still know " tries to be as successful as the first the film was , but really fails in the attempt . i mean , it s okay when slasher movies rip-off each other , but when they start copying themselves . . . * find all of jason s reviews at http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/boulevard/7475 * * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas at http : //www . movie-tickets . com '
negativeC,' it s hard to approach the good and bad in this film without being caught up a discussion of the message of bosna ! , for this is a film that explicitly sets out to convert its audience to its side , to make people aware of the war and to try to influence them to pressure their governments to intervene . it s a film that s very aware of itself , of the process of its making and of the influence it might have : for example , mitterand s visit to bosnia is portrayed as an outcome of information given to the french president by the director , bernard-henri levy . the film is full of very disturbing images : a mother and child fleeing from snipers in sarajevo ; bodies littering a street after a shell has landed on a bread queue , many of them with legs or faces blown off ; starving prisoners staring at the camera through the barbed wire of a concentration camp . it s impossible not to be moved by the suffering of these people , and difficult not to feel anger at the inaction of the diplomats who do little but talk while people are fighting for their lives and homes . the film makes much of comparisons between western indifference to bosnia today and western indifference to czechoslovakia and the spanish republic in the 1930s . there is , suggests levy , the same denial , the same explanations that it s all much too complex to get involved in . in 1945 people saw pictures of the concentration camps in poland and said " never again " , but now that the camps are back it seems that we would rather deny them , or suggest that there s fault on both sides , then determine to stop the atrocities . if there is anything i don t like about bosna ! , it is the incessant wordiness of the voice-over . perhaps levy was so anxious to persuade that he didn t dare to let the audience come to their own conclusions . at times sounding like a biblical prophet , at times hectoring us , at times reflecting on how the war affects our image of ourselves as europeans , the narration never lets the eloquent pictures speak for themselves , pictures that have more than enough power to move and to persuade on their own .

negativeC,' rating  length : 93 min ( 1 : 33 hours ) director : les mayfield producer ( s ) : john hughes , michael polaire cast : robin williams , marcia gay harden , christopher mcdonald , raymond j . barry , clancy brown , ted levine , wil wheaton , jodi benson ( voice ) as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding , especially three times . but , alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber . it s amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything . the whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful . this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor . well , this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded . along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber . thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience . the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber , but it seems to have a life of its own . this is there strictly for the kids . the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs . although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone . the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at , get his fiancee back , finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire , and do all this in the funniest way possible . admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original ( the absent minded professor ) . the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable . the basketball players , stereotypically unqualified for the sport , somehow manage to bounce , fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning ? this just sounds too bad to be true , the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance . as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie . giving life to the flubber , which is so poorly executed that it s best forgotten , and prof . brainard s flying robot weebo . giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasn t for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie . the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well , but it wasn t and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good . now , weebo is a totally different story . it s a robot that prof . brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too . this is a really original idea , well maybe not , but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie . yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters . the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all . the acting by robin williams ( prof . brainard ) seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced . most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12 . people when stood up at the altar , don t usually give third chances . or for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards , but what can be expected this is a children s movie . flubber , as a movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect . with the best character in the movie being something of a prop i doubt that many people will find it all that great . it does have its amusing moments and it is a good story in the end , but it does not wash up to the original . kids should find this movie amusing and fun and they ll probably enjoy the whole movie . as a movie it s just a kids movie and not the best of ones at that .

negativeC,' roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . . ben kingsley ? " my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles . the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious . that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast . gary " gal " dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain . life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing . but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch . the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa . the second punch comes from gal s past . back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv s lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal . he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal . don will accept any decision gal makes from " yes " to " certainly . " however , if gal says " no " don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy s ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) . in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody s skin . kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness . there are some serious problems in louis mellis s and david scinto s script that should have been caught before filming . when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success . beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him . any local hood could have done what gal is needed for . additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault . no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar . i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade . the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability . the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git im . it is not a great plot . in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards . perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film . it is an old plot dressed up to look new . if the plot is old , at least the style is creative . this is director jonathan glazer s first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes . we see one side of a person s faces . but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit . half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden . us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog . at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language . sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film . the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western . further respectability comes from ben kingsley s high-powered performance . i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

" robert de niro ( " taxi driver , " " raging bull " ) , billy crystal ( " city slickers " ) , lisa kudrow ( " the opposite of sex " ) , and director harold ramis ( " national lampoon s vacation " ) . these are usually reliable filmmakers ( well , okay , crystal has been in a sizable slump lately ) , and tellingly , the first half-hour of " analyze this " was very funny . unfortunately , as the running time ticked away , i began to think that the first thirty minutes had , unbeknownst to me , been rewound and were being replayed another two-and-a-half times . the film has obtained a clever premise , but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen . middle-aged psychoanalyst ben sobel s ( billy crystal ) life is finally going very well . although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents , especially his father , who is also a psychiatrist , ben has an easy-going teenage son ( kyle sabihy ) and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend , laura ( lisa kudrow ) . in little but a flash , however , ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti ( robert de niro ) , who desperately wants counseling , even though he himself won t even admit to having anxiety attacks . ben tries to help paul , mostly so he will get him off his back , but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding , which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death . it seems to ben that no matter what he does , paul vitti will not go away , and the more they become involved , the more ben s potentially happy life gets into danger . " analyze this " has a few laughs sprinkled throughout ( mostly in the first half ) , but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan , ramis , and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke ( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles , while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal ) and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106-minute running time . admittedly , de niro is very funny here ( and i can t remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him ) , and crystal is in top-form , but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them , including a substantial plotline . since " analyze this " bills not one , not two , but three writers , you d think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws , but they must have all been on auto-pilot . one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters , all of which have next to nothing to do and aren t even given multi-dimensional characters to attempt to develop . coming off of her oscar-caliber work in two of last year s best films , " clockwatchers " and " the opposite of sex , " lisa kudrow s throwaway " girlfriend " role is an incredible step down . sure , kudrow s fellow " friend " jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in " office space , " but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston . kudrow , meanwhile , mostly just stands around , no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place . chazz palminteri , as rival gangster primo , fares even worse , in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character . finally , molly shannon ( rising film star and cast member on " saturday night live " ) has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal s patients and then completely disappears . too bad , considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal . once " analyze this " approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow s laura standing alone at the altar once again , i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone , and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most , ben . afterwards , the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul , became a real laugh-free dead-zone , losing its last remaining comic punches . " analyze this " proves that talent can certainly help any film out , but when the written material isn t up to their level , what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air . - copyright 1999 by dustin putman  "  http : //hometown . aol . com/filmfan16/index . html '

" i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism . sure , there s a lot of sex and nudity , but it s almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions . anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater . i suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly ) . although the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone . this creature , dubbed " eve " by its creator , dr . laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile . meanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars . a team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them . ross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he s soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session . his intention is obviously world domination . standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick s fellow astronauts , dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) . but when patrick learns about eve , a female of his kind , there s no damping his ardor . i m not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) . michael madsen and marg helgenberger , both back for a second round , are clearly on hand to do as little as they can , grab the money , and run . ditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick s father -- " underused " is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( " invisible " would be more like it ) . george dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general . meanwhile , justin lazard s performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge s limited abilities look good by comparison . the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick . complete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics . director peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness . do i recommend the movie ? absolutely not , but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn t try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do . here s hoping there s no species 3 .

negativeC,' senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one-joke concept a bit too far . director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this , having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies . marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon , a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage . however , he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition , scott thorpe ( david spade , in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep ) : an athletic record , sponsorship by a fraternity , and , most of all , a wealthy family to back him up . in fact , darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet . but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel . he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university s dr . wheedon ( brad dourif ) . as a result , his senses are magnified tenfold . using his newfound abilities , he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job ( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side-effects to having super senses ) . naturally , marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle , giving jim carrey-ish amounts of physical humor . the problem is , aside from a few genuinely inspired bits , there s not much that s funny here . the film has it s one central gag , and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor . there obviously wasn t much thought put into the plot . the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous . i mean , why the emphasis on extra-curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single-elimination quiz anyhow ? and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester ? to give it credit , senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl s roommate , tim laflour ( matthew lillard ) . apparently , he is supposed to be faddish , but the film never does anything with him , leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie . his " intervention " scenes with darryl , however , do provide a rare , and welcome , laugh . and then there s the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one . in this case , the object of darryl s amor is janice ( tamara taylor ) , a fellow student who won t have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super-senses . needless to say , the romance is completely extraneous , and adds little to the film . this is a film that desperately needed something else . be that a good plot , more jokes ( or simply funnier ones ) , or a strong character or two , anything would have helped senseless get off the ground . as it is , all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can t help marlon wayans get this one off the ground .

negativeC,' these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes . but , only a few years ago , before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice , sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers . sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south . the way to regain popularity and prestige , they thought , was the use the same formulas , characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place . one of such celebrity was eddie murphy , black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade . in order to return to the spotlight , he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film , beverly hills cop , 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 . seven years later , for the third instalment , he used the directorial service of john landis , another fading star , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in trading places and coming to america . this time , however , third time wasn t the charm and beverly hills iii was failure . eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback . eddie murphy here plays axel foley , fast-talking streetwise detroit policeman , who raids illegal chop shop . the routine police action ends in tragedy , when the criminals kill foley s boss . determined to bring the killers to justice , foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald ( timothy carhart ) . when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles , foley goes back to los angeles . there , with the help of his old friend , local policeman rosewood ( judge rheinhold ) , foley would clash with money counterfeit ring . ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different . in this decade , the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills , which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film , simply doesn t work . screenwriter steven e . de souza provides another conflict , this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business-like professionalism of the bad guys . since foley belongs to the former , his character had to watch his language , and the tone of the film in general is more infantile . unfortunately , this film still belongs to action movie genre , and there is too much violence for little children . nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning , which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath . unlike donner with the lethal weapon series , landis simply can t balance the comedy with " regular " action , and the result is a film that fails in both aspects . action scenes are sometimes interesting , but not too spectacular ( at the end , scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself ) ; humour , on the other hand , falls flat . to make even worse , some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure ( especially art expert turned into arms dealer , played by bronson pinchot ) . in the end , although the film provided some entertainment , viewers , at least critical ones , would probably be happy to know that there aren t any plans for beverly hills iv .

negativeC,' in michael corrente s " outside providence " , the first image we see is that of a boy on his bicycle . behind him , tied to his bike with a rope , is a kid in a wheelchair , throwing newspapers to people s houses . tied to the wheelchair is a three-legged dog , limping for his life . we ve seen this picture before , now haven t we ? if " we " have seen a film by peter and bobby farrelly , then yes , we have . but then again , the farrelly brothers  three films ( " dumb and dumber " , " kingpin " and " there s something about mary " ) all had something going for them . a hilarious sense of humor and an aura of unpredictabililty . " outside providence " , which is based on the " semi-autobiography " of peter farrelly , shares neither of these two qualities , and doesn t have much to offer . peter farrelly s alias in the film is tim dunphy ( shawn hatosy ) , a teenager who lives in 1970 s pawtucket , rhode island with his wheelchair-bound little brother and his alcoholic , aggressive father ( alec baldwin ) , who refers to tim as " dildo " . tim lives a somewhat bored existence in pawtucket , where he spends his time going to parties and getting high with his friends . however , when he accidentally crashes into a parked police car , he is given no choice but to spend his senior year at cornwall academy , a strict co-ed private high school . tim makes a few new friends , and manages to break just about every rule the school has . but it isn t until he meets jane weston ( amy smart ) , the best-looking and perhaps smartest girl in school , that he begins let go and just try to have fun . and of course , through jane , tim learns about real love , and starts to do better in school . " outside providence " also relies on a small subplot which has old man dunphy ( alec baldwin ) and some of his buddies sitting around playing cards . in one particular scene , a guy named joey ( george wendt ) admits to being gay , and the guys kick him out of the house . this scene and another awful subplot involving tim s dead mother make up the dramatic core of the film , which is not good news . not only is " outside providence " a story we seem to have seen before , it is also a very poorly made film . it s predictable , corny , unfunny and gratuitous . why do i have a good feeling that the farrelly brothers were forced into adding a three-legged dog and a barfing scene ? maybe because i took a look at miramax s marketing push behind the movie . the acting isn t very good either . shawn hatosy and amy smart are one-dimensional as the leads , and even a " different " performance by alec baldwin , who surprisingly takes a supporting role here , is only marginally good . " outside providence " , the book by peter farrelly , was blasted by critics , so it doesn t surprise me that the farrelly brothers would be the ones adapting it for the screen . being a farrelly brothers movie , the movie obviously has some fun scenes , but the film as a whole feels pointless , and without direction , thanks in a large part to first-time director michael corrente . miramax films has made some very smart moves in the past few years , and financing this piece of recycled trash was not one of them . a review by akiva gottlieb , the teenage movie critic akiva@excite . com http : //teenagemoviecritic . 8m . com this review is also featured at http : //jump . to/moviepage get free voicemail , fax and email at http : //voicemail . excite . com talk online at http : //voicechat . excite . com '
negativeC,' old soldiers never die , they just turn into clichesthe warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body . jungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it s difficult to integrate both . often we ll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung s magician , sit around imagining grand schemes . without the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams . warriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy . they don t care enough about anything to know what s worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle . this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies . america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers . todd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype . chosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine . his childhood is cruelty and competition . he is indoctrinated with the big rules . never question authority . winning is everything . strength beats knowledge . a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he s obsolete . a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger . left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he s unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world . obviously our hero is still alive . he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health . when the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world . they are the other good guys . these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons . todd finds himself in the role of protector . what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon . the effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion . the plot is old hat . we don t get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers . hardly anything makes sense . the film s science fares badly . with all the remarkable advances we ve made in just 37 years ( the film takes place in 2036 ) , we re still stupid . after conquering the stars , for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away . even stranger , the garbage barges appear to double as time machines . virtually all the trash is vintage 1960 . there is nothing in the story that is not predictable . the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra ( connie nielsen ) , the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him . it doesn t take a genius to foresee that her husband isn t going to be around much longer . is it a shock to find out that the film s climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine ? who would you guess wins ? some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy . todd s first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie s nipple poking through her thin blouse . later as he sits by his lonely campfire , a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion . supposedly this cliché isn t meant to be humorous . dastardly col . mekum ( jason isaacs ) with a pencil-thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash . responsible for last year s quirky and visually enticing but problematic " the fifth element " , director paul anderson sees the film as " shane " in outer space . maybe , if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode . the movie doesn t even work as an action film . there is never a question as to the outcome . somehow the new superior soldiers don t prove much of a match for todd . the acting isn t anything to write home about . nielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim . russell is buffed-up and does a credible job but it s not much of a challenge . uttering around 100 words during the film , mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space . gary busey as todd s commanding officer is completely wasted in his low-key role . everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool . sometimes the sets are impressive . unfortunately " occasionally " and " sometimes " don t make a film . most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote " blade runner " , possibly the best science fiction movie ever made . sharp-eyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film . peoples says that this is not a " blade runner " sequel , but a " sidequel " that takes place in the same universe . although that may have been the intent in his original script , the result is more like a bad television series that the " blade runner " replicants watch to pass time . perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining .

negativeC,' directed by dominic sena . screenplay by scott rosenberg . starring nicolas cage , giovanni ribisi , delroy lindo . running time : 121 minutes . rated aa by the mfcb . reviewed on june 11th , 2000 . movies like " gone in 60 seconds " boggle my mind . here we have a cast of academy award-winning actors . we have a scenario that promises lots of high-octane action and excitement . we have a screenplay written by scott rosenberg , who penned the entertaining " con air " . we have that film s producer , jerry bruckheimer , who has also overseen such thrilling fare as " the rock " , " crimson tide " and " beverly hills cop " ( although , it should be noted , also masterminded that most gratuitous waste of celluloid , " armageddon " ) . and yet despite these promising ingredients , we have a movie that just doesn t deliver . " gone in 60 seconds " feels like it can barely get out of neutral , let alone shift into high gear . nicolas cage plays " memphis " raines , formerly california s best car thief and now retired to run a gas station and go-kart track . unbeknownst to memphis , his brother kip ( giovanni ribisi ) has followed in his footsteps and is trying to make his own name boosting autos . but kip messes up one night while on the job for raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) , who took over when memphis left town . contacting memphis , calitri informs him that he needs to steal fifty rare cars in the space of four days , or kip will be killed . reluctantly agreeing to reenter his old profession , memphis starts getting back in touch with members of his old gang , including mentor otto ( robert duvall ) and ex-girlfriend sway ( angelina jolie ) ; kip brings along his own young accomplices to fill out the ranks . but by the time the team has been assembled and the reconnaissance carried out , only twenty-four hours remain before calitri s deadline , forcing memphis and his friends to boost the fifty cars in a single night . and to add to their troubles , they must contend with veteran cop roland castlebeck ( delroy lindo ) , who missed his chance to nab memphis once , and does not intend to let it pass him by again . " gone in 60 seconds " is based loosely on the popular 1974 drive-in feature by hb halicki , and i headed into the theatre expecting one of those movies which sacrificed plot and characterisation in favour of relentless excitement . i was half right : there s not much plot and not much characterisation , but it takes an hour and a half before the film even starts trying to get the adrenalin pumping . the big problem with the movie is that it feels like it was made from the first draft of the script rather than the final version . rosenberg s storytelling is extremely clumsy . after a mildly entertaining opening bit , we are sucked into a dull and overlong middle section in which memphis brings together his team , checks out the cars , and reencounters old sparring partner castlebeck . not only is all this extremely tedious , it feels almost unnecessary . rosenberg is obviously trying to give each of the players a distinctive personality but lacks the skill to do so , and would have been better off spotlighting just a handful . the result is that memphis  team consists of a dozen people all with minimal characterisation , and none of whom we end up caring very much about . this is particularly unfortunate because it means that some very talented actors like duvall , ribisi and jolie are pretty much wasted in roles that struggle for screen time . duvall , for example , is consigned to standing around a warehouse most of the time . jolie appears just long enough to remind us of the tremendous charisma she brings to any role , and make us wish her part was more significant . eccleston , as the malevolent calitri , seems like he could have been a delightfully cartoonish sort of villain , but appears only briefly , in the film s first and last half hours . cage , meanwhile , seems to be on autopilot as memphis ; he does what he can with the paltry material , but there is no real enthusiasm to the performance . cage lowers himself to the standards of the script , rather than trying to bring it up to his own level . examples of these low standards litter " gone in 60 seconds " . there are some sequences which are so contrived , and feel so obviously shoehorned into the plot , that i found myself shaking my head in the theatre . for example , late in the film , one of kip s friends -- a computer wizard who usually stays behind a laptop rather than heading out into the field -- suddenly demands to go on a heist . that he nearly screws everything up should come as a surprise to no one . rosenberg s dialogue also verges on the excruciating at several points ; calitri is described as coming after kip " like stains on a mattress " , for instance . " gone in 60 seconds " finally gets moving when after an hour and a half -- gasp , shock -- we finally get some car chases . these are undeniably engrossing , although i was disappointed that they weren t a little more inventive . certainly , they are inferior to such memorable chase sequences as , say , gene hackman s in " the french connection " . they are also somewhat hamstrung by dominic sena s otherwise competent direction . more than once , sena is unable to keep the depiction of the car chases fluid and coherent , and this difficulty in following the action works against its entertainment value . but perhaps the worst thing that can be said about the car chases is that they lead up to the film s routine , lacklustre and faintly ludicrous conclusion . it is here that the laziness of rosenberg s script is most evident , giving us an ending which not only steals from every other b-grade action movie , but also totally dismisses one of his principals  established characterisation . as mindless summer entertainment , " gone in 60 seconds " isn t bad , but even the most avid action fan is likely to be turned off by the movie s lethargic pacing . compared to the film s two hour running time , the twenty minutes or so of car chases seems paltry , given that the anticipation of these scenes is the movie s main selling point .

" joe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . he runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . he picks things up and stares at them pensively . he breaks things on accident , because he s just too big to avoid clumsiness . joe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . as a character , he doesn t quite register . and the story he s been put in is as limp as they come . the words " family entertainment " have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . the picture is a remake of the 1949 film . it s mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . the main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . as a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . specifically , she s out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . soon , zoologist gregg o hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill s mother . so , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . in addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . and , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill s mother . jill , of course , doesn t recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . the movie isn t really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . but the story is really dumb , there aren t any characters , and the film isn t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . the movie also has bad dialogue . if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it s only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like " joe isn t happy ! " and " joe isn t safe here ! " " we need to get joe out of here ! " " joe is way too big for that cage ! " i don t know if these phrases are word for word , but they re close . as i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . sadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . there are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . it s certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . but adults in the audience aren t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla .

negativeC,' starring-joshua jackson , paul walker , leslie bibb , craig t . nelson , hill harper , william peterson , christopher mcdonald and steve harris director-rob cohen canadian rating-pg released by universal pictures - 03/00 `the skulls  is a laughably bad thriller , a teen-orientated doppelganger of `the firm  so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor . certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter . i chuckled incessantly , all the way home . let me share . the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i m sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college ) . luke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report . despite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization . soon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account . yeah , dude , pretty good deal eh ? but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating ; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable . the premise , although lacking in originality , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense . unfortunately , `the skulls  is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting . it s just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars . . . . but not the script . `the skulls  is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers . first off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm . afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar . will they never take this watch off ? and what if they forget it by their bedside ? perhaps their secret  society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed . on top of this , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters . gee , why not member t-shirts ? but my favorite bit is this : the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual agree  or disagree  notions when making collective decisions . they are given official skull paddles . when flipped to one side , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal . facing the opposite way means a disagreement . wouldn t they merely express themselves verbally ? hell no . they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote , and maybe afterward they can play ping-pong . i m still chuckling about these ludicrous details , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest . the cast , meanwhile , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `dawson s creek  crowd , and fuses the two together , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout . but not entirely . accomplished actors like craig t . nelson ( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake ) and william peterson ( as fellow board member senator levritt ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures , and look suitably embarrassed handling them . and then there s christopher mcdonald , who has the capacity to be a fun , exciting actor . mcdonald s charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role ( yes , pogue makes it a hat-trick ) . i pray it was a `snatch-the-paycheck-and-run  exercise for all these actors . the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better . let s cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character . paul walker , the strapping quarterback from `varsity blues  , is bland but passable as caleb mandrake - the judge s son . walker preserves a straight face , even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie ( `dad , i just killed a guy in the ritual room !   ) . some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb , who plays luke s longtime chum chloe , and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics . it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one . or maybe not minute one , thanks to a decent set-up from director rob cohen , who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style . it makes you wonder why he didn t flee indefinitely from the project , because while enjoyable cheese like `dragonheart  and the moderate stallone thriller `daylight  aren t superior cinema , they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash . aside from unintentionally humoring the audience , `the skulls  gets little accomplished . the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical . the story is stuffed with ridiculous , formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick . instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization , we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage . we ve seen it all before , and better . `the skulls  is a feeble little circus of stupidity , so miscalculated that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like boneheaded  seems just too generous .

negativeC,' directed by luis mandoki . cast : robin wright penn , kevin costner , paul newman , jesse james , illeana douglas , john savage , robbie coltrane , viveka davis . 1999 - 126 minutes rated pg-13 ( for profanity , mild violence , and sexual situations ) . reviewed february 13 , 1999 . director luis mandoki s last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama " when a man loves a woman , " but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , " message in a bottle , " which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up . everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there s an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , " meaningful " statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through . " message in a bottle " begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day . inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper . soon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message . of course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa s age and played by kevin costner . she is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett s late wife who died a few years earlier . do you think you know where this is headed ? most likely you do , and i wouldn t call it giving away anything to say that by the picture s end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn t buy for a second . if there are any positive things to say about " message in a bottle , " it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett s stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , " shaggy dog " love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city . meanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has made recently . it seems that with such bad luck , he wouldn t want to make another movie set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea . the other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the " friend " roles , here playing penn s confidante and co-worker at the tribune . the first half of " message in a bottle " plays like a hum-drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time " getting to know " garrett , with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining . usually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt " written , " and not as if people were really " talking . " when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not particularly interesting themselves , you know immediately that you are in trouble . i swear that while watching " message in a bottle , " i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i m not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks ) . always one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing . nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa s secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after . this same exact problem occurred in last year s very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicolas cage romantic drama , " city of angels . " although theresa is deeply touched by the " heartfelt " letter that she finds in the bottle , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own , preferably before filming began . it should have read , " memo to screenwriters : use you brain !

( all this is later reported on tv with amusing black , media-satirizing humor ) . in a roadside gas station the brothers add to the body count . it s so gratuitously , crazily shown that the violence is stylized and surreal . as they re fleeing to mexico , another in-joke , a kind of x-ray of their car s trunk , reveals momentarily their trussed up hostage . someone has been watching godard and truffaut movies ; someone ought to have learned from them more about substance and subtexts . a family of three in an rv are the next hostages . the parts are performed with unusual calm --another in-joke . harvey keitel is a widowed pastor who has lost his faith . in another joke on the audience , keitel s daughter juliette lewis , whom we would expect to join the brothers as a natural born killer , does not . in a logic-defying gag , chinese-american ernest liu plays the son . clooney wonders : " how can he be your son ? he looks japanese . " " no " retorts keitel , " he looks chinese . " of such bits is the first part made . they are sort of promising , although for a good , oddly lyrical yet based-on-fact killing spree movie i would recommend " badlands " ( 1973 ) with martin sheen and sissy spacek . entering mexico , the brothers rendez-vous with their mexican contacts in titty twister , a huge , crass , baroque , surreal strip joint in the middle of nowhere . it is full of nude dancers and swarthy , murderous-looking mexican bikers and truckers . ( texican rodriguez keeps perpetuating movie cliches ) . one of the customers has a miniature cannon strapped to his private parts . the joint almost makes you smell sweat , body odors , and think of v . d . violent things happen . after a lull , satanico pandemonium ( beautiful salma hayek from " desperado " ) does a number with a huge snake . suddenly she morphs into a ghoul --as does everyone else . becoming allies , captors and hostages unite against an onslaught of vampires , the undead , monsters . the struggle goes on forever . how long is " forever " ? my stopwatch  s battery got so fed up that it died . at the start of this second half there are sporadic gags . " does anyone have a cross ? " ( to stop the vampires ) . " no , but two pieces of wood would do . peter cushing does it all the time . " a disquisition on vampires follows . " we need a book , a real book " " like a time-life book ? " cheap humor , but still preferable to the mayhem . interminably , the morphing and re-morphing disgusting vampire critters attack . the lurid , incoherent hodge-podge of massacres is an orgy of gore and dismemberment . it also kills whatever character development was present earlier . unrelieved , very dull , this becomes a second , tacked-on , irrelevant movie . the visuals and other special effects are skillful , but so what ? it s all deja vu . the only original , also surreal gag , at the very end , when we see the back of the joint . it is built like a mexican pyramid . the fortune all this cost could have rodriguez s parents , nine siblings and extended family live in comfort for a lifetime , with money left over for another ten generations . this flick is not merely over-the-top , it tops the topper . it is not plain old pulp fiction either . much of it is what happens to pulp after it s been digested .

negativeC,' actually , i m fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie . " baywatch " babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d s on the small screen . at least there you don t have to pay to see her cleavage . and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless , hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire . you wouldn t be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in . i can t go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there . they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude , it s so quick you can t even tell for sure whether you re seeing her andersons or not . a nipple hallucination sort of thing . barb wire was adapted from a comic book , interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life , even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions . yes , like the mona lisa , pamela anderson is a man-made beauty , probably in more senses than one . she is a definite beauty , though , and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience . you d just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn t have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie , because it s obvious she wasn t pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills . i mean , she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler s convention . the movie is set in the year 2017 , " the worst year of my life , " pam says . ( " the worst movie of the year , " i say . ) america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think ) . she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right , posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute . but don t call her " babe . " she hates that , and reminds us of that fact way too many times . imagine , a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist , demeaning term . a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn t have to hear words like " babe " during a strip tease , especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success . the plot ( ha-ha ) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate s retina scanners . in the words of one of the characters , they re " more than meets the eye . " reminds me of the " transformers " cartoon , and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent , but that never happened . no , the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van-damme , big-busted kickboxer , and her resistance accomplices , ex-boyfriend axel ( tamuera morrison ) and cora ( victoria rowell ) . thank god they didn t name her cora reef . one bad character name is more than enough . pamela originally doesn t take sides , giving some speech about she s only loyal to the money they pay her , but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother , jack noseworthy of bon jovi " always " video fame . i still don t know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy , but he definitely is nose worthy ( even if he isn t sponge worthy ) . pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi-automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest . it s not rambo . . . it s bimbo ! mark my words , barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year . it s got all the elements of the direct-to-video releases featured on hbo s bastard cousin , the cable channel i d never watch if it didn t somehow come free . it s got the non-titillating scenes of voyeurism , laughable flashbacks , bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo . there s even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie s premise while the words scroll up the screen . someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain t star wars . if you ve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years , you ll recognize plenty of lifted elements . barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over , car crashes , explosions , broken glass and slow-motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death . this is one of those automatic-pilot movies anyone could write or direct . barb wire has only two things going for it . . . and i think you know what those two things are .

negativeC,' polish wedding ( pg-13 )  ) in this year s summer movie preview issue of _entertainment_weekly_ , theresa connelly described her writing-directing debut , _polish_wedding_ , as " a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would . " one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film , a comedy-drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements . the family at the center of _polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks , which consists of mother jadzia ( lena olin ) , father bolek ( gabriel byrne ) , sole daughter hala ( claire danes ) and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness . it s a large family , but there s not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch , certainly not in the primary trio . jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family , but she s kind of a hypocrite since she s carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija ) . her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek , who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration . also , how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy , sexy jadzia ? hala is a spoiled , self-centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy . with such an unappealing set of characters , it s no surprise that _polish_wedding_ s plot complications are far from involving . naturally , jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop , russell schuster ( adam trese ) , who fathered the child , but he refuses to make such a commitment . ho-hum . another complication , involving the decidedly un-virginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary , is first played for laughs and then , inexplicably , as a profound statement in the film s climax--which , ironically , is funnier than any of the film s lame attempts at humor , such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell . that scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly . the jadzia-bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers . the hala-russell conflict isn t resolved in as contrived a manner , but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something . and then there s some atrocious dialogue , which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound : " look at all these pickles . just looking at them gives me such great sadness . " as misguided as _polish_wedding_ is , the affair is something of a letdown , considering the strong performances by byrne , danes , and especially the fiery olin . they obviously believed in connelly and her material--a faith that audiences will be hard-pressed to share .

negativeC,' one of the 90s  most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave : it s the " ___ from hell " movie ! starting in the early nineties , we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships-from-hell ! there were boyfriends from hell , friendly neighborhood cops from hell , nannies from hell , and even secretaries from hell . but hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush : the mother-in-law from hell ! ! ! ! ! the mother-in-law in question is martha , played by jessica lange . she has been single-handedly running the family horse farm , kilronan . her son , jackson ( johnathon schaech ) and his girlfriend , helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , live in new york , and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan . but those intentions are about to change . you see , martha lives by manipulation . she has used it in years past to breed many championship horses . now , she believes she can use it to breed herself a grandson . though at first , helen finds martha charming , soon she is caught in the domineering martha s web of deception . it s hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to martha  schemes . as written , most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted . but then , the film even treats the audience like idiots . it tries to get away with things ( like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place ) without even batting an eye . then again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isn t one that s likely to question details . jessica lange s martha is the only semi-developed character in the film , and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can . a character that could have been simply awful is merely groan-worthy . gwyneth paltrow doesn t have much to build upon , as helen s only character trait seems to be " daughter-in-law " . still , she fares better than johnathon schaech , whose character is so nonexistent , he s inexplicably missing for much of the film . still , there have been much worse " ____ from hell " films . even with its paper-thin characters and ludicrous setups , hush manages to create a few thrills in a color-by-numbers fashion . you know what s coming , but occasionally the film will deliver a shock or two . the old formulas are around for a reason , but that doesn t mean they taste fresh .

( mgm/uip ) director : scott silver stars : claire danes , giovanni ribisi , omar epps , dennis farina , josh brolin , michael lerner , steve harris , richard jenkins . another old tv series is revisited and updated for the  90 s . however , this lacklustre big screen version of the mod squad , which originally ran from 1968 to 1973 , joins other dud adaptations such as the beverly hillbillies , lost in space and the recent my favourite martian . the original series centred around a squad of delinquent teenagers put back onto the streets by a tough but sympathetic cop , who used them to infiltrate seedy bars and clubs and street gangs in an effort to fight crime . this big screen version takes the same premise , but basically trashes it with a formulaic and unoriginal plot that involves crooked cops and illicit drug deals . this  90 s version also loses the rebellious anti-establishment undercurrents that were prevalent in the  60 s and  70 s , and which gave the series an unusual edge . this new look mod squad is little more than an average television movie , and is unlikely to appeal to the same audiences that remember the similarly themed 21 jump street with more affection . the script is trite and predictable , the dialogue terribly clichéd and the characters one dimensional . scott silver s direction is pedestrian . the three stars lack rapport , and their performances are uncomfortable , flat and uncharismatic . claire danes does the best she can with the undemanding role of julie barnes , the street wise former drug addict . giovanni ribisi ( from the other sister , saving private ryan , etc ) brings an intensity to his performance as pete cochrane , the rich kid turned bad , that seems misplaced given the almost comic book quality of the material . omar epps ( from higher learning , etc ) gives his linc hayes all the life and energy of a lump of wood . veteran dennis farina is wasted as the squad s mentor adam greer , whose murder kick-starts the plot . the ending conveniently leaves the way open for a sequel . however , if prolific producer aaron spelling was hoping to turn the mod squad into a successful new movie series he has sadly under estimated the intelligence of the audience and over estimated the quality of the banal script .

negativeC,' in times of crisis people are driven to desperate measures . of course what constitutes a crisis differs from person to person . what may be a disastrous situation for one , may be seen as a challenge to another . as deepak chopra is known to say , " it s not the ride , it s the rider . " unfortunately clear-thinking is not always the reaction to problems . wall street wheeler dealer steven taylor ( michael douglas ) is a man with troubles . he s sunk his money in illegal financial activities and it s blown up in his face . in a matter of days he will lose it all . his wife emily ( gwyneth paltrow ) is a highly-placed un interpreter and is not happy with her life either . her marriage is cold and unfulfilling . unknown to her , her new lover david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) is not only a painter , but an ex-con with a history of bilking wealthy women of their money . emily is a prime target : she s worth over $100 million . steven s solution to his predicament is to offer david half a million to kill his wife . the artist accepts and the movie is underway . drawing from frederick knott s play and loosely based on hitchcock s dial m for murder , this is all-too typical of summer releases . all style and no substance . and there s really not much style . director andrew davis ( the accomplished witness and best-forgotten other films ) has made exactly the wrong choices at almost every turn . douglas and paltrow have both shown us that they are skillful actors in previous films . mortensen showed promise in the past . here all three are walking uninterestingly through their roles with oddly waxen faces . the only person who shows any sense of life is david suchet as new york detective mohamed karaman . he s only on-screen long enough to make you think that there might be a likable person in the film and then he disappears . the first concern of a suspense film is to create suspense . surprises are important . in this movie the audience keeps waiting for something to happen . and nothing ever does . nearly every event is telegraphed in advance . close-up on this object or that action and it s easy to guess what s going to happen . as the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion you keep expecting a plot twist to make the movie worthwhile . it s a hopeless quest . the story doesn t make much sense . steven s wife is loaded . even with unfriendly relations , you d think that he could have talked to her about his difficulty rather than deciding to kill her . when he does decide on the dire plan he makes an unreasonable choice . if you were going to hire someone to kill your wife , would your first choice be her lover ? no matter how sleazy he is , i would think there might be a chance that he would turn down the opportunity . why would steven plan the murder as a break-in in their apartment ? why not just take her out as she was walking to david s loft in a bad neighborhood ? while deciding among the numerous summer films , you might do well to skip this one . you ll find more suspense than this movie offers by watching the weather channel .

negativeC,' cast : rentaro mikuni , choichiro kawarazaki , kazuo kitamura , kazuko okiyama , yasuko matsui , yoshi kato , hosei komatsu , kanjuro arashi , chikako hosokawa , chikage ogi , jun hamamura . credits : directed by shohei imamura . screenplay by shohei imamura and keiji hasebe . adapted from the 1962 play paraji . cinematography by masao tochizawa . music by toshiro mayuzumi . art direction by takeshi omura . shohei imamura has always liked making " messy , really human , japanese , unsettling films . " and he has done exactly that in kamigami no fukaki yokubo ( the profound desire of the gods ) , a film he made in 1968 that had to wait two decades to be released in its full 170-minute version in the united states . using vivid color and and magnificent cinemascope photography , imamura reaches back to ancient myths to explore the incestual origins of human society in the tiny island paradise of kuragejima , in the ryukyu islands . imamura coalesces all aspects of the film into a coherent whole with a supreme confidence that permeates virtually every shot of his film . not until the short epilogue at the end does this rare sort of masterful filmmaking go slightly astray . the film is defined by its six main characters , who form a microcosm of both the island s past and its encroaching future . four of them are members of the futori family , which has a long history of engaging in taboo practices ( like incest ) and being punished by both the gods and their fellow island residents . because of this , they are commonly considered little more than animals by the other islanders , and they are treated accordingly . twenty years ago , nekichi futori ( rentaro mikuni ) was discovered having an incestuous relationship with his sister uma ( yasuko matsui ) . according to legend , the gods showed their displeasure by hurling a huge boulder onto the island during a terrible storm . the islanders then chained nekichi for his crimes and put uma in the care of the local noros ( shamanesses ) . to appease the wrath of the gods , nekichi has been digging a pit for the boulder to fall into for the past twenty years , and the job is nearing completion . nekichi s son kametaro futori ( choichiro kawarazaki ) is understandably confused about his heritage , since nekichi is the son of his own grandfather . kametaro is also uncertain about his future career plans . kametaro s sister toriko ( kazuko okiyama ) is mentally retarded and is quite content to wander around in a burlap sack and to be used sexually by island men . the other two main characters in the film are the village headman ryugen ryu ( yoshi kato ) , who manages a sugar mill on the island , and mr . kariya , an engineer from tokyo who is sent by his company to construct a water source for the mill . kariya is , of course , the representative of civilization , and he finds the local traditions and myths that obstruct his task to be incomprehensible . ( as may be expected from this culture clash , imamura draws a few comedic moments with kariya . ) also in the film is grouchy grandpa futori ( kanjuro arashi ) , who eventually dies and returns from the grave in a night-time vision seen by many of the islanders . finally , tokuri the balladeer ( jun hamamura ) imparts the film with much of its mythic proportions through his storytelling and songs . for most of the film , imamura calmly and casually explores the idiosyncratic world of the futoris and their life on kuragejima with an almost documentary-like style . but all throughout the film is an ongoing subtext that ultimately relates back to the film s title . furthermore , that subtext is the heart of the film and is crucially dependent on imamura s camerawork . typical of how imamura constructs his shots is one scene where kariya , ryugen , and kametaro ( who has become the engineer s helper ) inspect a cliff for sources of water . most of the scene is shot matter-of-factly from ground or eye level . however , as the three begin to inspect a hole already dug in the rock , imamura abruptly shifts the camera angle to an overhead shot . on one edge of the cinemascope frame is kametaro and on the other edge are ryugen and kariya . because the sudden cut is deliberate and repeated throughout the film , the scene strongly implies that the three men are being watched by hidden , unseen forces . and because the camera photographs the three men precisely on the edges of the frame , it seems as though the hidden forces are watching them through a perfectly situated window that leads from one world to another . the question of who or what these hidden forces are -- the key to the subtext -- is answered by numerous stylized shots of owls , lizards , birds , snakes , and other animals . ( these shots are , by the way , good examples imamura s fascination with hybridizing documentary and dramatic styles . he first explored documentary authenticity in his 1963 film nippon knochuki [the insect woman] . ) the common factor linking most of the animal shots is that imamura repeatedly focuses on the animals  piercing eyes . that -- and the fact that imamura includes them in the film at all -- transforms the creatures into physical extensions of an omnipresent divinity constantly observing the island from all directions . this is especially apparent when an owl with bright yellow eyes gazes steadily at the characters as they bumble around in a forest late at night . the cinematic link between nature and divinity is the underlying structure that the entire film is based on , and indeed it is the key to beauty of how imamura documents the vagaries of human interaction and the worlds in which they live -- the issue with which imamura is ultimately most concerned . one should note that imamura s camerawork both raises the sense of watching through a window and also conveys a sense of the animals -- actually legendary gods through the film s identification of divinity with nature -- as the ones doing the watching . what the film s title , content , and structure emphatically exclude is the possibility of equating the film s " gods " with the film s audience . it would be smug and arrogant to assume that the film s viewers are meant to be gods . because imamura s camera often switches focus from the human characters to the animals and back again , it is clear that the camera s field of view does not singlemindedly represent any one particular perspective . and even if it were imamura s intention to make viewers into gods , so to speak , the viewer-gods would be necessarily impotent and ineffective , since the viewer is at the mercy of imamura s cinematic and narrative judgment . to the other hand , one could conclude that the film is little more than an indulgent effort to equate the real god back to imamura himself . while imamura has played similar tricks in his other films -- most notably in his 1967 film ningen johatsu ( a man vanishes ) where imamura surreptitiously photographed a woman who is searching for her missing fiance and who falls in love with the fake interviewer-investigator imamura paid to accompany her -- there is no such sense of egotism in kamigami no fukaki yokubo because imamura never calls undue attention to his camera tricks . he also does not carry anything to gratuitous extremes . imamura is certainly fascinated by the dirty laundry of humankind , and it is therefore only natural that he would be attracted to the themes of incest and lecherous gods that kuragejima has to offer . but in this film at least , imamura wants to examine and learn from those themes , not exploit or revel in them . the abrupt epilogue of the film somewhat disrupts the flow of the film , but it does effectively address how these concerns have changed the community five years after the main events of the film . kariya , the engineer , returns with his family to visit , as does kametaro , who has become disillusioned with life in tokyo . although western influences have transformed the island ( coca-cola signs are everywhere ) , new indigenous legends are also emerging . imamura implies that such folklore will always find resources to survive in the face of encroaching realities . what is most striking , though , is how strange and foreign the visitors seem on the island . not having witnessed the events that led to the creation of the new myths , the visitors will never consider the rock named after the now-deceased toriko to be anything more than a curiosity . kametaro is best qualified among the visitors to realize the full import of the changes , and it is therefore appropriate that he is the only one who sees a vision of toriko dancing on the train tracks ahead of the locomotive pulling kariya s train . this is a rather clumsy method , but imamura makes his point : kametaro ( and the audience ) are well on their way to realizing that the story of toriko has now become intimately anchored within the village s traditions and collective mythology -- just as a large rock hurled onto the island became a part of the local lore twenty years earlier . imamura is in this film concerned with the symbiotic relationship among individual humans in a primitive society , as well as the dynamic tensions between civilization and mythology . he has managed to explore the relatively isolated world of kuragejima with both his and the residents  integrity intact . not once does imamura patronize the villagers . and his filmmaking is near the height of perfection . imamura s documentary-style footage is in fact decidely manipulative , but it is also disarmingly laidback and easygoing enough that that neither the narrative impact nor the cinematic illusion ( except during the epilogue ) is ever lost . kamigami no fukaki yokubo is another of imamura s excellent films , one that has endured two decades of obscurity in this country . the full length version will undoubtedly transform that situation for the better .

negativeC,' starring : keanu reeves , james spader , marisa tomei . when i first saw the previews for joe charbonic s new serial killer thriller , i thought " hey maybe keanu might come out with a somewhat decent movie " . i was somewhat disappointed with " the matrix " though i liked it never-the-less . i went into " the watcher " expecting a somewhat good serial killer flick and walked out with a headache , some confusion and wondering why they wanted to make this movie in the first place . i may be the only one to give this movie this low of a rating , but when you have to sit through a movie , checking your watch every five minutes to see if it is over yet , then it is definately bad to me . james spader plays a detective who has been haunted from memories of his past . a killer has been following him trying to latch on to him , after he did something horrible to his girlfriend . he has a therapist ( marisa tomei ) who is trying to help him through all this trauma he is going through . now the killer ( keanu reeves ) is sending him pictures of the girls he is going to kill , and spader has one day to try to find them before its too late . now all of new york city has to strap down and try to find these girls before the body count becomes bigger . jumbled plot ? bad writing ? sloppy direction ? flat acting ? thats pretty much what all this movie has in it . first of all the plot , if that is what you want me to call it , is so underdeveloped that is painfully confusing and so predictable that by the end of the movie i leaned over to my girlfriend and said " let s go " . i wasn t going to be insulted anymore , but she insisted on staying saying it has to be good somewhere somehow . of course when i left the theatre she thought it was good , while i thought the opposite . i had to wonder why keanu reeves a somewhat talented actor chose such a terrible role as a serial killer , who isn t believable as a serial killer , nor does he fit the serial killer role . james spader has never been someone in hollyweird i have liked , and in " the watcher " he doesn t prove to me he can really be anyone i will like , after starring in the huge flop earlier this year " supernova " he really hasn t had much in the way of a job . his character is completely and utterly underdeveloped and we know nothing about him to like or dislike . marisa tomei is one of the top-billed stars and has around fifteen minutes of total screen time . joe charbonic s direction is not good either , and some of the sloppily made scenes in the movie are so dumb that i started to get a pounding headache . a five year old could have made a better film than this mess . the script is somewhat good , but the dialogue that comes out the actors mouth is stiffly said , and doesn t make much sense sometimes . could " the watcher " have been a good movie ? its highly doubtful and in the end product it clearly shows that hollywood is starting to run out of steam in their movies . with " almost famous " coming out in a few weeks , i m highly waiting for a really really good movie worth the watch , and worth the wait of a trip to the movie theatre , until then though i tell you to avoid " the watcher " if anything possible , go see " the way of the gun " its not great but at least its better than this .

negativeC,' seen with tony in june 1995 at the angelika . you very well might have missed party girl , which came and went from theaters quicker than you can say " library card . " while many reviewers judged it mainly on the merits of lead actress parker posey ( tales of the city , dazed and confused ) , with entertainment weekly and people magazines giving it " b " ratings , this fun little film rises in ratings appeal when seen from the librarian s point of view . [inline] our protagonist is mary , a doyenne of the downtown scene . when her latest illegal rent party is busted by the police , she is bailed out by her godmother ( played by sasha von scherler ) , a nypl librarian . to pay off her debt , mary becomes a clerk at a branch library ( a jersey city library posed as a nypl branch for this film ) and is immediately challenged as irresponsible and not up to the " challenge . " mary eventually memorized the ddc20 and begins her quest--better living by getting an mls . along the way , mary is also involved in helping her disc-jockey friend , leo ( guillermo diaz ) get a job , and in a romance with falafel vendor mustafa ( omar townsend ) i noticed that the scenes i reacted to most did not concur with the audience s . those who reacted along with me must have also been librarians and other likeminded people . hearing the librarians  professional bickering , seeing the fans blowing on water-damaged books , and other little touches would most likely only be best appreciated by those in the know . scene to watch for : mary confronts a patron who reshelves a book improperly . what really makes party girl stand out , from the mls ( masters of libary science ) point of view , is that becoming a librarian is seen a constructive , positive objective , rather than a punishment . fifty years ago , the worst thing that could have happened to mary baily in it s a wonderful life is to have become a librarian . after decades of hollywood showing the profession in the most unflattering poses , party girl shows us a hip downtowner deciding to improve her life by getting an mls . a nice change of pace and certainly worth looking for in the videostores . basically , if you are somewhat familiar with libraries , falafel , the dewey decimal system , house music , babganoush , or new york city , you will probably enjoy this movie . the perfect break for those times your not at the library yourself . note : this review originally appeared under this title in keywords , the newsletter of the queens college graduate school of library and information studies student association . reprinted with my permission ( since i wrote the review and edit the newsletter ) . librarians will also enjoy desk set ( 1957 ) . _________________________________________________________________ copyright ( c ) 1997 seth j . bookey , new york , ny 10021more movie reviews by seth bookey , with graphics , can be found at http : //www . geocities . com/athens/2679/kino . html '

"   the film is outright stupid , but some of the elements are subtly horrifying .   for instance , take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo , and then feels really guilty .   this is a serious problem in real life , but six days , seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device :   his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford .   in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety , i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story . this is summer movie season , but that doesn t mean our movies have to be dumb .   1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters .   when i was in line for six days , seven nights , i heard the woman in front of me ask for " two tickets to that new harrison ford movie . "   why didn t she know the name of the film ?   i suppose she just didn t care .   what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big-budget pictures don t realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves .   good actors should sign to good scripts , and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash , they least they could do is assume that we d like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents .

negativeC,' directed by steven zaillian . cast : john travolta , robert duvall , stephen fry , william h . macy , james gandolfini , kathleen quinlan , tony shalhoub , dan hedaya , john lithgow , mary mara , kathy bates . 1998 - 115 minutes . rated pg-13 ( for profanity ) . reviewed january 10 , 1999 . since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993 s steven spielberg drama " schindler s list " and directed 1993 s intelligent " searching for bobby fischer , " his new film , " a civil action , " should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . what doesn t make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . the film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . based on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , " a civil action " is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children s death from leukemia due to unknown causes . jan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families  homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city s drinking water . suddenly , after hearing about the families  heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . also figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods  corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . coming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , " a civil action " is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . watching the film , i couldn t help but notice its similarities with 1997 s far , far superior film " the sweet hereafter , " which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home . not only was the plotting similar to " a civil action , " but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . considering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful " a sweet hereafter " was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm s character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . in " a civil action , " however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . we do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . through its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta s lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn t appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . every scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . you ve got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents  plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what " a civil action " does . to be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . aside from one flashback to when a man s young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . i could say the performances were good , but who s fooling who ? since every character is one-dimensionally written , no one s acting abilities are challenged in any way . travolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that s about all he does . duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets . and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture s final scene , as a judge ? she appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? finally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ? abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , " a civil action " seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with . - copyright 1999 by dustin putman dustin putman s film haven  '
negativeC,' cast : melissa joan hart , adrien grenier , stephen collins , faye grant written by : rob thomas based on the novel " how i created my perfect prom date " written by : todd strasser directed by : john schultz running time : 91 minutes the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film s end . if you re not familiar with this law , then maybe you ve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film s end . now if you re a regular reader of mine , you ve heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? no , it definitely is not . melissa joan hart ( from abc s " sabrina , the teenage witch " ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team . adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who s just broken up with his activist girlfriend . apparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back , and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance . so the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud . will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ? will this crazy scheme work ? do i care ? the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy . what makes movies like can t hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she s all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly . i don t know what the writer s intention was with drive me crazy . there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to . here there s nothing . . . just teens whining about who s going to take them to the big dance . do me a favor kids , go get a job or something . . . just shut the hell up . in all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits . now normally when i say that it s followed with the joke " . . . because the movie is finally over . " in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film . after the obligatory second playing of britney spears  titular song , there s a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school . nothing great , but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them . sci-fi fans take note : there are brief appearances from stephen collins ( star trek : the motion picture ) and faye grant ( the tv miniseries " v " and " v : the final battle " ) .

" alicia plays , well , the babysitter , who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents ( j . t . walsh and lee garlington ) go out to a party . the film , trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers , shows every characters  thoughts , except alicia s . the thing is alicia s in most of them in most cases , and the thoughts aren t too kosher . first off , there s her boyfriend ( jeremy london , who gave one of the all-time lousy performances in " mallrats , " and is only a notch better here ) , who s a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully , played by nicky katt from " suburbia " ( who shows he s got that quiet creepiness down pat once again ) . they decide they want to crash her babysitting job , looking for the typical babysitting hanky-panky . somethine like that . the film intercuts between the subplots ( alicia babysitting , nicky and jeremy , the party ) and each characters  thoughts . we get to see jeremy and nicky s dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia , j . t . thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub ( she has it all covered up , the little tease ) , and , worst of all , lee garlington dreaming of that hunk , george segal . it even shows them in bed together . yea . i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed , though i guess i m used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in " flirting with disaster . " the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing , but come on . like we care about any of the characters . the only interesting one is alicia , mainly because she s alicia , and we mostly see her in the fantasies . so i guess she s some kind of mystery or something . but she is never explored further . so , basically , this film is just a series of mastabatory images , sometimes featuring a non-nude alicia ( once again , sadly ) , sometimes featuring a scantily-clad george segal ( once again , sadly ) . i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night , and let me tell you , it is the only way to watch this film . i mean , there s a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night : they re just as good as sleeping pills . and this one is one big fat waste of time , even for an alicia film .

negativeC,' so ask yourself what " 8mm " ( " eight millimeter " ) is really all about . is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? is it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there s a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won t necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? or is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ? i m not talking about snuff films , supposed " documentaries " of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . i m talking about films like " 8mm " and its director , joel schumacher . with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- " batman & robin , " " a time to kill , " " batman forever , " " the client " --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence . is " 8mm " something you really want to see ? probably not . the first two-thirds of " 8mm " unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core . then , as it s been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence . and just when you think it s finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further . trust me . there are better ways to waste two hours of your life . nicolas   " snake eyes "   cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband s safe documents a young girl s murder . welles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don t need any specialized skills or training to do this . welles certainly makes it look easy . and cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues . the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader s " hardcore . " occasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task . there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa . " 8mm " doesn t condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it . the irony , of course , is that schumacher and " seven " scribe andrew kevin walker s vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product . so we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror . later it s the turn of joaquin phoenix ( who s quite good and by far the film s most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again . all this to get to the familiar yet offensive " revelation " that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me . neither super nor standard , " 8mm " is shocking only in its banality .

negativeC,' " easely one of the worst films of the year . . " with the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century . this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil . the result is somewhat predictable . i didn t have high hopes about arnold s " much anticipated " return to the big screen . schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers won t be bored , and the catholic league will be angry . everyone else will see  end of days  for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture . think of it as hollywood s own y2k bug . did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you ll get 999 , as in 1999 ? yes , you better believe it . . satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days . this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold . he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc . the way it works is he smirks and something explodes . before the stroke of the new millennium he s got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations . only schwarzenegger s cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him . films like this has one serious weakness -- logic . no matter how you twist the " plot " , you ll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! ) . the incredible fact is that such directors never learn . after thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big cliché . here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution . he is walking around n . y . , blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius . all he wants is the girl , that is somehow special . but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks , he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter . so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : " you can have your wife and daughter back . . i can give you happiness that you can only dream of . . just give me the address . . " indeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller . and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger s comeback , will not be very satisfied . we ve not seen him in a while . that s because he didn t have a worthy opponent . he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars . he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop . so , after all those fights , what s left for arnold schwarzenegger ? how about satan ? in my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron s " terminator " . and that is schwartzenegger s strength -- muscles and no emotions . here he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar . this is called " an adult turn " if successful and " a flop " if unsuccessful . make a wild guess ! his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems . this requires at least some acting skills . regrettably , the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles . the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters . the movie is otherwise technically impressive , with a solid cinematography and fine lighting . but the movie doesn t serve neither as a serious thriller ( because of its stupidity ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone ) . the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry . the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular . so i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody . unless you are a die-hard schwartzenegger fan , stay away . as for schwarzenegger , he ll be back .

" flubber " straps him in a straitjacket , covers him with duct tape , stuffs him in a coat closet and piles furniture against the door to make sure that he doesn t get out . in a re-make of its own 1961 " absent minded professor " , disney offers us proof that more is definitely less . recycling old films ( " that darned cat " , " 101 dalmatians " ) dressed up as new is the newest money machine from the home of the mouse that roared . professor phillip brainard ( williams ) is a terminally forgetful scientist teaching at a small college . his fiancee , sara jean reynolds ( marcia gay harden ) , president of the college is none too happy with him because he s left her waiting at the altar due to his lack of short-term -- and long-term -- memory . she s giving him one more chance . he blows that chance when he invents " flubber " ( flying rubber ) and is so excited by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress . his tardiness is helped along by his jealous flying robotic assistant who wants him all to herself . it s not all bad news . flubber is a green jello that can magnify and reflect energy that is applied to it . brainard realizes the commercial potential within the goo can save the school from bankruptcy and being taken over by the town s evil industrialist charles hoenicker ( raymond barry ) . while he s busy with his new breakthrough , the slighted sweetheart is being wooed by his sleazy rival wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald ) . there s a flying car , flubber-enhanced basketball game and an assortment of broken lab equipment : none of which are the least bit interesting or funny . at one point , my son looked around the audience and asked " why are these people laughing ? " although williams turns in one of his least inspired roles , he is easily the most lively of the actors . everyone else comes across as half-asleep . the re-make is successful in that respect . it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties . i remember the original as being charming , but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years . there have been some updates . fred macmurray s flying model t has been replaced by a t-bird . his faithful dog charlie is now " weebo " , the hovering robot . the biggest change is that , with sophisticated computer animation , we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining . flubber is anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality . the gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number . this has nothing to do with the story . the only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys . not that contributing little to the plot is a big problem . there are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do don t make sense . the discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford . anyone with half a brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions . it s unbelievable that his lover ( well , probably not a lover -- after all this is disney ) starts dating croft after the aborted wedding . there s not one appealing component of this man . after the professor discovers that smearing a golf ball with the gunk causes it to bounce uncontrollably around his lab wreaking havoc , i cringed as he picked up a bowling ball . this guy is beyond forgetful , venturing into the certifiable . co-writer john hughes used to direct light-weight but thoughtful teen films . the care behind " pretty in pink " and " the breakfast club " all went out the window after his " home alone " franchise heated up the box offices . looking much like " home alone 3 1/2 " , " flubber " even features a couple of vapid goons who get banged around and a cute little boy who screams a lot . in some ways , it s difficult to judge this film . i have a suspicion that i m not it s target audience . after all , i measure my age in two digits .

negativeC,' the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission . he attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth , but misses . after they ricochet off his face , he says , " not a good start . " as it turns out , this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence , but to the rest of the movie as well . in this , the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong , chan plays an international operative codenamed " condor " , and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazi s during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war . for some reason , condor is given his mission at the u . s . embassy in spain . i think this may have been done so that in a chase scene , they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart . watch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country , most notably in europe . the chase will take itself through a marketplace , and a fruit cart will be overturned . it s almost a guarantee . anyway . . . . condor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden ; the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it , which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly . to help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly , condor is accompanied by a desert expert ( carol cheng ) and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold ( eva cobo ) . there aren t supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain , but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something . although these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission , they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts . in fact , most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight . i suppose this isn t so bad , since chan s action is really the best part of the movie , and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway . if you ve never seen a jackie chan movie , don t expect a great plot , but do expect to be entertained by his moves . they are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human . knowing that he does his own stunts , and knowing that this is the real stuff ( no computer-masked bungee cords here ) makes the action sequences all the more exciting . you ve got to hand it to a guy who s probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art . also of note in this , as in any jackie chan movie , is the humor . as far as i know , none of his films take themselves too seriously , and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue-in-cheek quality about them . what is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes . unlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme , where the fights get you on the visceral level , fight scenes in chan s movies are simply entertaining . you marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh . unfortunately , even chan s mastery can t save this film . the plot and characters are so weak that they don t hold the movie together at all , and the acting is terrible . carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past , but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off . this , combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying .

negativeC,' imagine putting both addams family movies together , adding a heap of sexual innuendo , and placing the effects of men in black on top of it . now imagine taking the dry wit out of all these movies , adding an extreme amount of violence , ethnical slurs , and push-up bras . wild wild west , a new creation of barry sonnenfeld , director of get shorty and men in black tries to make it work . . . it doesn t . exactly whose fault it is is yet to be determined , so let me just give you an outline . james west ( smith , who still fits the superhero role nicely , but he s horribly miscast ) is teamed up with effects specialist artemus gordon ( kline , who puts on that fancy-pants know-it-all thing that worked in in & out , but not here ) to save president grant from an 80-foot tarantula created by arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh , who , i m ashamed to say , should stick with helena bonham carter and shakespeare ) he s using to take over the entire us government turning the northwest into loveliss land . now this could be an original premise , but the film is so darned contrived that you know will smith will win in the end . whereas , arlington road ( a better action/paranoia thriller by about , oh , * * or * * * stars ) had a suprising explosive ending that you couldn t see coming until the very end , this one s obvious at about the 30-minute point . i believe that the filmmakers realized this , so they decided to make the film more fun by adding cool gadgets , heaps of jokes about breasts , tons of violence ( an extreme amount for a pg-13 movie ) and racial and ethnic slurs that sound like their coming from episodes of jerry springer and american history x . this film is not for children and parents should be very cautious about taking them to it . i actually believe that a child would benefit much more from seeing south park : bigger , longer , and uncut , arlington road , or maybe even american pie . thus , i give wild wild west ( the worst movie of the year so far along with virus ) * 1/2 stars . '
negativeC,' the happy bastard s quick movie reviewa better name for this movie might ve been " wild wild waste " . warner bros . , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib s success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad . but somehow , they ran into a problem along the way . they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would ve made all the difference- a story writer . wild wild west s story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon . if warner bros . had gotten him , the movie would ve possibly been five times better than what it is . heck , ten times . as is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he s performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well . here s the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair . they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path . as i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess . but the acting doesn t help either . kevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado . smith seems to be having a better time as west , although he s not nearly as charming as he was in mib . branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can t even stand to look at him or his strange beard . and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention . her acting is barely passable , but what a " breath of fresh ass " . director barry sonnenfeld isn t of great help either . even though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost . it s as if he feels he s directing a tv movie , a big no-no when you re helming what s supposed to be a big-screen hit . last but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable . at one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline s train . he jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it s still in motion ! also , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks . last but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he s not kissing a woman as he s looking through a peephole at the enemy ? ! the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects . the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show . there s also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity . i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn t possible . if the racist and sex jokes don t bother you , the performances will . if the performances don t bother you , the story will . if the story doesn t bother you , the racist and sex jokes will . there s no end to the vicious circle . go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats . you ll have a better time . if you do go , keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant . i bet he wishes he were somewhere else . . .

negativeC,' i really wanted to like dude , where s my car ? after a week of deadlines , dead time , and dead emotions , i needed a goofy movie to revive me . so , imagine my horror as i sat alone in the cavernous theater , trying to muster a chuckle or a titter . ornery ostriches didn t do the trick . neither did a transsexual stripper , a pot-smoking dog or an appearance by fabio . there is a place for movies like dude , where s my car ? -- national lampoon s animal house , blazing saddles , tommy boy , etc . when they work . and when that happens , i m on a cinematic high for weeks . i still smile whenever i hear the phrase " double secret probation . " in the case of the silly comedies that fail , it s like watching a guy slip on a banana peel . it might be funny the first time , but how about the fiftieth time ? unfortunately , dude has crates full of bananas , and it s ultimately doomed -- just like its two main characters , jesse and chester ( ashton kutcher and seann william scott , respectively ) , doper roommates with a major problem . after a wild night of partying with chester , jesse can t find his car the next day . the two friends don t even have a clue as to what happened the night before . the boys soon embark on a madcap adventure to find jesse s car . in their odyssey , they gradually learn about last night s events , which included strippers , buff aliens , and tattoos . jesse and chester also discover that they are now responsible for the fate of the universe . bummer . i know a movie like dude is geared for brainless laughs , but shouldn t some thought have been invested in making it ? the movie survives solely on the aforementioned wacky antics , which turns dude into a feat of endurance that would fatigue a marathon runner . there s no break from the goofball proceedings . screenwriter philip stark and director danny leiner don t give us a single character with any wit or subtlety . watching dude is like viewing a parade of the hackneyed characters of movies past . there are stoned morons , sympathetic girlfriends , bullying jocks , super-intense space nerds , and the soulful black pizza owner ( from the last dragon , of course ) . as for jesse and chester , they might be the first characters in movie history without a working cerebrum . it would have been funnier if these guys were smart , so they could sarcastically comment on their absurd situation . but scott and kutcher are given little more to do than say " shibby " and " sweet " in a frat-boy cadence . . . and then break things . and that s a shame , because i like both of these guys . kutcher is a dopey highlight on the fox sitcom that  70s show , and scott with his prankster grin was a big reason why american pie was my favorite movie last year . in dude , their scenes induce empathetic winces , instead of laughs . i wish i could say something glowing about this mess , and i wish i had an idea of why people are seeing it . my guess is it s either an indication that 2000 was truly a terrible year for movies , or it could be a genuine sign of the apocalypse .

" . . . "  bamboozled  was wack ! , you bougie traitor ! " . can t win for losing . ] as a visionary tale , bamboozled knows few equals . spike lee nailed many of the dysfunctional issues black folks in america have as a people ( and , of course , as the many sub-cultures within the larger , mostly-undefined black culture ) , and well as the issue itself : what exactly does it mean to be black in america ? is dela less black than julius because julius is " keepin  it real " ? is dunwitty - clearly a caucasian - * more * black than dela because dunwitty considers himself " street " ? is the white maumau blacker than * all * of them ? and when it gets right down to it , is there even such a thing as one single " black culture " ? though lee s targets were many , and wide ( and , depending on who you ask - for instance , hollywood s finest black comedy stars , many of whom loudly questioned lee s " right " to do this movie - just plain off-base ) , i found his aim fairly accurate , for the most part . all the " nigga " -slinging , all the malt-liquor drinking , all the empty mau-mauing - even the mental separation of us into " blacks " and " negroes " ( or , telling it like it  tis , " niggers " ) that too many of us ( me included ) do . . . when spike aimed , and hit , it spoke to many of the things i ve long felt were cultural ills with us here in this so-called melting pot . the most heinous ill being that we so gladly supply the cork , and willingly apply the ugly blackface , to ourselves . but - and this isn t a small thing - being a visionary is only half the battle ; to have a successful movie , one must also have successful acting and directing , a tight storyline , and cohesive editing . and that is where bamboozled ultimately failed . granted , a spike lee joint doesn t always follow the typical moviemaking blueprint of your standard motion picture . to that end , the weird jumpcuts , the unnatural-feeling scenes , and the strange editing , were lee trademarks . but this film couldn t afford lee s quirks * and * his inability to cut out the repetition on the one hand and " grow " the story on the other * and * an in-your-face storyline , all at the same time . that , on top of the unbelievability of both mantan s and sleep  n eat s instant revelations with no good cause ( except , of course , the " wake up ! " caused by looking at your cork-blackfaced image in the mirror , which should make * anybody * say " hmmm . . . maybe this isn t a good idea after all " ) , and damon wayans  bizarre choice of a one-dimensional portrayal of delacroix , almost killed the joy of the bamboozled philosophy for me . great acting by jada pinkett-smith , michael rappaport , and an interesting turn by rapper mos def as big black africa , could not overcome lee s lack of tight focus , the far-too-easy " instant " acceptance of the minstrel show by the audience , the completely incredulous " payoff " involving the maumaus and mantan ( my eyes truly rolled ) , or wayans  just plain bad acting - and worse , the bad decision to let him do the narrative voiceover . the " jolly nigger " -type collectibles , and the black actors of the past who did what they had to do - and having done so , * allowed * a spike lee , a damon wayans , et al , to be where they are today - should have supplied the final narrative . too bad they weren t really allowed to speak . the " black factor " [obdisclaimer : we are not a monolith] : " we are not a monolith " . it is my daily mantra . and it applies oh so well to bamboozled . but what , exactly , does it mean ? it means that somewhere out there , there s a harvard-educated , stick-up-the-butt , " negro " -labelling , confused dela ; and a status-seeking , hard-working , bougie , confused sloane ; and a tap-dancing , fast-talking , struggling-to-get-by manray and womack ; and a malt liquor-drinking , gun-slinging , pseudo-revolutionary julius . and like it or not , they re all black . which , of course , lays waste to the one huge stereotype we seem to be portrayed as on the idiot box that pierre set out to feed . if this , more so than the viewer s experience of the acting itself , was the ultimate point of bamboozled , then bad acting/directing/editing or not , bamboozled is indeed a masterpiece . one that , when all is said and done , should be seen , no matter your color . bammer s bottom line : bamboozled , conceptually , is something that spike lee should be applauded for . would that the finished product were as great as the concept behind it . it pains me to say that ; after all , i drove 88 miles to the hood just to see a movie that a lot of theater owners in predominantly white neighborhoods were apparently too chicken to show . i desperately wanted to love this movie for both its message and the talent behind it . the message came through loud and clear ; but judging bamboozled on its creative merits alone , we have been hoodwinked . bamboozled ( mixed rating ) : a greenlight rating for what visionary spike lee * tried * to say ; but . . . . . . a cautionary yellowlight for the way director spike lee said it . spike , i gotta go with what dela s mama said about him : you disappoint me .

negativeC,' director : john flynn writer : david lee henry starring : steven seagal , william forsythe , jo champa , jerry orbach , gina gershon , julliana marguilles , shannon whirry , john leguiziamo , athena massey it was with a huge lack of something to do that i decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon , when the only good things on tv are the second-rate movies they show ( some are good : they showed " total recall " before this one ) . if you know me , i think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live . and this includes keanu reeves . what do i hate about seagal ? i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and non-threatening situation ( the squint ) . i hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around , bullying people up , saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynold s hairpiece in " boogie nights . " i despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights . i hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain . i hate his non-satirical messages ( in the beginning of this one , he slaps on a quote from arthur miller , which has nothing to do with the film , except it s about brooklyn where this film takes place ) . and i hate how he s so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing ( during the end credits , he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him ) . sure , the guy s probably a nice guy in person ( i actually found him very non-threatening when he was on letterman not too long ago ) . but the guy makes worse films than reagan did . so what s the plot of this shit-terpiece ? well . . . something about him trying to catch a stupid-ass crook ( william forsythe ) who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight . i couldn t believe how bad this scene was - the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ( ahem ! ) . and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off . i m sorry , did anyone ever hear of concealing one s self ? so in comes ex-brooklynite seagal , who dedicates his life to catching this guy . and i just wished he had caught him in the beginning , then ended the film . but noooo , this drags on , as he bullies forsythe s family members ( including a stupid bar-owner , and none other than gina gershon as his other bar-owner sister ) . and forsythe more than once threatens his family . at one point , he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a non-threatening nicholson in " the shining " ( complete with them all hiding in the bathroom , but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away ) . seagal paints himself as a lovable person , with a son , and a fiancee . he even shows him hanging with his son , checking up on his homework , and then about to take him out for a bit of " catch , " when he s conveniently called away on assignment . i dunno about you , but playing " catch " with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares . he also shows him as that bad-ass he wants to be , with scenes of him bullying crooks around , and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he s unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue . serves them right . this film , as some of his do , has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented , but don t appear to be in this film . i already mentioned gina gershon ( who s pretty horrible in this one ) , as well as william forsythe , who over-acts terribly . i know this guy can act : he was awesome in " raising arizona " as goodman s partner in crime . but he s just awful here . jerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down . why is he the only one who gives a good performance ? well , because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility . he seems to be in here just to give it a cool " law and order " feeling ( even if it s not a " cool " feeling ) . and in cameos are b-rated erotic-thriller-cinemax-style stars , shannon whirry ( as " terry malloy , " which is more of a bad joke than a clever one ) and athena massey . oh ! and " er "  s julliana margiulles has two scenes . " out for justice " just proves once again that american action films just suck . i know that there s such a good thing as good action - he s called john woo . but if you re in the mood for some good old no-brainer , fun-yet-dumb action , don t bother watching this . it s so stupid that it s boring .

negativeC,' susan granger s review of " mulholland drive " ( universal focus ) whatever david lynch is selling , i m not buying . from the writer/director of " blue velvet " and " twin peaks " comes another dark , mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive , the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills . dazed , a beautiful brunette ( laura elena harring ) emerges and stumbles down a hill , slipping unobserved into a  30s-style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip . the next morning , a dewy blonde ( naomi watts ) from deep river , ontario , arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase . her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet . the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust . meanwhile , a hotshot director ( justin theroux ) , whose wife is in bed with the poolman , is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there s an assassin ( mark pellegrino ) roaming the city . the tortuous paths of these various characters - and others named cookie , coco and cowboy - intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because , midway through the story , lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality , leaving a huge wad of cash , a blue metallic key , a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered . elena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses , effectively making the subtle switch . the same cannot be said for former m . g . m . dancer ann miller who s stiff and self-conscious , speaking - like most lynch players - in staccato tones . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " mulholland drive " is a frenzied , frustrating 4 . originally designed as an episodic tv pilot , this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out .

negativeC,' yeah , yeah , the advertisements didn t even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook - sex . neve campbell and starship trooper s denise richards getting it on ? ok ! yeah , it s a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that s your main interest in this film , there s plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes . wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however . nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie . but this fast-paced , razor-sharp turning of events doesn t leave much time to enjoy the surprises . we start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making . guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts . right off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce " mr . lombardo " . the fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor s jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you ll be soaked from head to toe when you re done . on the weekend of the car wash , kelly s attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day . naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations . but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low-class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor . pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray . yes , that bill murray ! sound like a good , complete movie ? yes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning . in fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film . it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time . by the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable . unfortunately , with so much going on , you re not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about . this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could ve been . the 113 minutes fly by , and although it never feels underdeveloped , this pretzel of storytelling could ve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken . the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime-time soap operas , which no , is not a good thing . and it s not just campbell , who happens to hail from the prime-time fox soap " party of five " , but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones . dillon , who was so charming in his understated role in last year s in & out , gives the best performance , and murray s surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film . in fact , if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy , even if it was the exact same film , i would actually give it a better grade . that s how cheezy it comes off . but aside from these two , the rest offer nothing more than some good eye-full s . in the right hands , wild things could ve been a wickedly delightful , scrumptiously twisted thriller , but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting . and what s up with these people passing as high school students ? i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles , but when i realized it wasn t supposed to be a college they were at , i had to snicker . i won t lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure . as corny as it is , it s got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a " b " for effort . but if you just want to admire denise richards , go for last year s starship troopers , which was every bit as campy , but a million times better . of course , if seeing her breasts is your most important goal , you ll be right at home with wild things . perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters .

negativeC,' based on the best-selling novel , left behind is the latest in an assembly line of evangelical thrillers from cloud ten pictures . considering the success of the omega code , there s a surprisingly large audience of zealots who dream of screening films with " spiritual value " nationwide . and apparently , all that hard work is paying off . let readers be warned in advance , if you re part of the camp which tries to catch the " so bad it s good " movies filmcritic . com cheerfully slams on a weekly basis ( and i mean you , battlefield earth ) , do yourself a favor and avoid left behind . even if your interest is akin to mine , approaching the entire affair as a postmodern joke , your contribution is paving the way for more of this generic , bible-thumping crap . with this kind of marketing campaign , every dollar counts . having said that , i really wanted to enjoy left behind . the premise has all the makings of a crackerjack apocalyptic epic in the vein of stephen king s the stand crossed with the omen . if handled right , this could have been the mainstream alternative to michael tolkin s chilling end-of-the-world melodrama , the rapture . on an international flight , half of the passengers vanish mid-air . this is not an isolated incident . around the world , christians have mysteriously disappeared without a trace . it seems the book of revelations has cracked wide open , and the newly departed are spared seven years of tribulation during the antichrist s rise to global power . those who have been left behind must struggle in the ultimate battle between good and evil , which will no doubt be further documented in the inevitable string of sequels . don t tell me that doesn t sound exciting , even to heathens such as myself . my interest abruptly waned the moment a freshly scrubbed kirk cameron appears on the scene as opportunistic news correspondent buck williams . we re asked to buy kirk cameron as a hardcore journalist covering an international crisis in the middle east ? named buck williams ? when buck places his camera in the middle " of the shit " as bombs burst in midair , it s difficult to shake the thought that this pathetic former star hasn t aged a day since growing pains . his behavior , his goofy smile , his curly locks of hair are all exactly the same . i guess some things never change , even after you re born again . buck pursues a conspiracy that goes all the way to the united nations . will he be able to warn idealistic scientist chaim rosenzweig ( colin fox ) that his " eden formula " which could end world hunger may land in the wrong hands ? sure enough , there s a missing disk , a car explosion , an attempted assassination , and shifty men in black who plot armageddon . these familiar genre requirements are as lifeless as they are predictable , shot with all the bland mushiness of late night cable television . indeed , left behind could easily be confused with less ambitious fare were it not for the preachy subplot involving the tormented pilot ( brad johnson ) of that ill-fated international flight mentioned earlier . when his wife and son disappear in the rapture , he falls to his knees begging forgiveness . if only he had listened when jesus was knocking on the door to his heart . it s not long before buck joins him as a soldier in god s army . after the end credits scroll on left behind s home video release , kirk cameron provides a public service announcement encouraging viewers to tell everyone they know to see this movie . my only request for the christians who happen upon this article : don t settle for less . go to the left behind website and demand quality scripts which address your theological concerns . of course , the built-in audience will see these movies whether or not they receive a critical bitch slap . after an initial release on video to spread word of mouth , left behind has found its way into the 20 top grossing theatrical releases during the week it opened nationwide . let s hear it for the almighty buck .

negativeC,' member of the  internet movie critics association  http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/studio/5713/index . html watching  bulworth  feels like having somebody punch you in the face and as you turn around to recover and regain your balance , there s somebody waiting that throws a bucket of cold water where you ve just been punched . in other words , the film is a double whammy of intended satire but comes off more as a series of condescending failed scenes which do nothing to advance the nature of the movie s characters and caricatures . caricatures are usually the least interesting thing about a film that centres on people because they never get developed beyond the realm of their first scene ( s ) , hence , their given name .  bulworth  has more than its share of unnecessary players and the centre piece of the movie s main personality is a man with a pretty unattractive personality named jay billington bulworth ( warren beatty ) . i understood completely where beatty was trying to go with this film but rather than churn out a political satire , beatty has instead made a film where bulworth rambles about our unbalanced society without telling us anything about how he intends to improve it . that is often the true nature of politicians and if the movie wants to do that , what exactly is its point beyond anything we ve seen before ? it doesn t take a genius to do a simple turning of the tables and make a fibbing politician , who doesn t believe in the things he s saying and turn him into a suicidal and supposedly conscience stricken self redeemer who becomes suicidal and says what s really on his mind . the film opens with a rehearsed speech billington intends to give where the opening line is heard over and over and over again and is the usual * blah * blah * blah * he will use in an upcoming campaign . we soon begin to see bulworth s mental breakdown as he displays his suicidal tendencies and takes out a large insurance policy on himself before hiring a contract killer to knock himself off ? ! i didn t believe it for a second . the idea is too simple to be believable and even if you accept the premise , the movie s core issue hasn t even surfaced yet . as bulworth is speaking to a large audience of african-americans in south central l . a . , he makes some rather blunt comments that he believes are true , putting aside the political line for an unexpected dose of what many will accept as reality . next his comments turn to the jewish community and these two outbursts cause a media carnage where bulworth is asked to explain exactly what he meant by these two incidents . somewhere in the middle of all this , he begins saying what he really feels is the trouble with american society . his remarks make the u . s . a . sound instead like the corporate states of america , perhaps a good theory and while reasonably admirable and truthful , his execution of these ideas are awkward and sound more like the ramblings of a paranoid fanatic . during his outburst in south central l . a . , he meets nina ( halle berry ) , a young woman from the community whom he fancies and he tries to understand her world and express himself through it by a transformation of image . it s a world bulworth doesn t understand because the words he hears and the problems he sees , he repeats them when interviewed on television and the execution this time isn t only awkward , its phony and self indulgent on beatty s part . what s even more astonishing about this film is the way that beatty presents not only the other characters in the film , but his own . the other characters played by such wonderful actors as jack warden , paul sorvino , oliver platt , don cheadle and christine baranski are never given any real focus or development and when the fate of beatty s character is decided , you will not care . beatty is more concerned with presenting his story too quickly and as you figure out that his film lacks depth and insight , you ll be amazed at what little foundation is built around the the rest of the story . beatty directs and is the co-author of  bulworth  and for a man who has been a part of classics like  bonnie and clyde  ,  shampoo  ,   heaven can wait  and his most ambitious film for which he won a best director oscar , 1981 s  reds  , beatty has made an abysmal failure of a film the has absolutely no after thought and is as stimulating as frozen silly putty .

negativeC,' running time : 2 hours 20 minutes starring matthew broderick , jean reno and maria pitillo directed by roland emmerich fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen . the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr . nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl . some shady u . s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard . and what s more , this beast is heading for new york . gulp ! although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is , there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie . the main faults lie with the acting and writing , common problems with  summer blockbuster  movies . broderick is pretty useless as the hero , with no humour or a  tough guy  image . while emmerich s previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither . also , maria pitillo , as broderick s former girlfriend , is just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting . she s incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and basically she s total crap . it s up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent . shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film . hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named  animal  , and he adds a little life to the picture . also making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter . o . k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies . but what about the script ? well , that s not up to par either . emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script . the dialogue is banal ( broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters  that s a lot of fish .   ) , and the character development is non existent ( reno plays the typical frenchman (  no croissant ?   ) , broderick forever remains a geeky scientist . ) also , the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour . the jokes that are uttered are pathetic , and there s an  hilarious  running gag about siskel and ebert . ( the mayor is mayor ebert , and is assistant is called gene ! ha ha ha ha ! . ) the plot is dire , and in the end just rips off jurassic park ( 1993 ) by having lots of baby godzilla s ( i . e . velicorapters ) running around new york . right , so the script and acting suck . but what about the special effects ? thankfully , they re are quite good . godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi , although we don t see much of him because the movie is so dark . the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell . but although they are impressive , they can t save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie . the movie goes on for far too long aswell , and it can t seem to decide on a ending . and of course , the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel . let s just hope one never arrives .

negativeC,' the marketers of hudson hawk obviously have a lot more talent than the filmmakers . misguided and miscalculated on every conceivable level , hudson hawk is the most lame-brained , stupefyingly awful movie to have come around in a long time . director michael lehmann ( heathers ) has taken a promising idea and turned it into a mind-boggling misfire , a sorry spectacle of a film that even the most die hard bruce willis fans will abhor . the movie s wooden and empty-headed plot revolves around master cat burglar eddie " hudson hawk , " played by willis . he s hired to steal three priceless da vinci artifacts by a variety of odious villains -- the mario brothers , george kaplan and the candy bars , and a pair of kinky and colorful miscreants , darwin and minerva mayflower ( played to the hilt by richard e . grant and sandra bernhard ) . the plan is to unlock the secrets of leonardo s puzzle , three rubik s cube-like crystals which , when put together correctly , are said to provide instant wealth and gratification . pity the same couldn t be said of the film . the hawk is aided and abetted by long time partner-in-crime and confidante tommy five-tone ( danny aiello of do the right thing ) . they get to perform a couple of gratuitously surreal musical numbers together , which shows you just how low this film will sink in order to get a laugh . andie macdowell ( sex , lies and videotape ) plays willis  love interest , anna baragli . lovely , yes , but interesting ? not in this movie . you know where the film s heading when it manages to poke fun at asians , the handicapped and overweight people all within the first five minutes . by its long overdue conclusion , everyone else in between -- including the audience -- has been insulted . the best thing in the film are the mayflowers , who resemble characters in a john waters movie . bernhard has a field day in her role as minerva , a garishly outfitted , rubber-faced dominatrix who gets off on psychologically ridiculing the mawkish hawk . her performance is hideously over the top , but that s what makes it all the more fun to watch . and grant s despotic darwin delivers what few funny lines there are in the film . waters , the director of such sleazoid epics as pink flamingos and polyester , has said that bad taste is what entertainment is all about . but in hudson hawk , lehmann abuses the privilege . apparently the film had more than its fair share of production problems , discernible from the opening credits . willis -- who must take a large part of the blame for this embarrassment -- co-wrote the story with executive producer robert kraft . kraft , in turn , shares screen credit with composer michael kamen ( die hard and the " lethal weapon " series ) . kamen was supposedly still working on the score days before the film was released . and it shows . the sound , too , is so bad you can t often hear what the characters are saying . and the film is poorly edited -- some snatches of footage are so short you re not quite sure what you are supposed to have seen . all this in a movie reputed to have cost upwards of $75 million !

negativeC,' the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don t count neil simon s biloxi blues ) . year after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt . bilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last . i thought stripes would be different . with ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army . instead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army . murray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him . so he does , and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences , more mind-numbingly stale here than ever . the characters are even less original , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette . all the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette ) fall victim to the lame , rehashed material and are never really likeable , murray in particular . he only gets a few decent lines in , although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters . he was even better in caddyshack , for crying out loud . as with a lot of the late 70 s / early 80 s comedies , stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it . i m sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women , but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition " dear god ! " every few seconds . stripes isn t the playful kind of sex comedy , either . most of the time it seems downright misogynistic , as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women s showers or murray lifts a female m . p . onto the stove and , with an i-know-what-you-like look on his face , says he s going to give her the " aunt jemima treatment , " which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly . you don t want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region .

negativeC,' susan granger s review of " ghosts of mars " ( sony pictures entertainment ) horror auteur john carpenter ( " halloween , " " vampires " ) strikes out with this sci-fi eco-fable that s so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green-lit . the script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year s " pitch black , " involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood-thirsty , marauding aliens . in the year 2176 , there are 640 , 000 earthlings on mars , living in a matriarchal society led by a commander , played by pam grier . grier , pill-poppin  natasha henstridge , and some rookie mars police officers ( clea duvall , jason statham ) travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch " desolation " williams - that s ice cube - to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder . but when they re besieged by demented , zombie-like , body-snatching miners , they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection . it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and , soon after , most of the miners went bonkers as long-dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies , lopping off heads as " vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet , " according to a scientist ( joanna cassidy ) . carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the " night of the living dead " -like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing . but you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed , along with the order of their elimination . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " ghosts of mars " thuds to a laborious , bottom-of-the-barrel 1 . perhaps , indeed , there is a curse on mars films , if you recall two other duds : " mission to mars " and " red planet .

" thomas and the magic railroad " is nonsensical , cheesy , saccharine drivel , with all the charm of its source material removed , and the low-tech special effects kept in . the original television programme was on a limited budget , and so the trains were plastic models with stationary painted-on expressions that talked without moving their mouths . this is a big hollywood movie , but uses the same technique , despite having computer graphics for its other sections . the movie s shabby , mismatched visual style prevents its multiple story threads from coming together , and creates a schizophrenic tone , especially as characters zoom across different worlds " alice in wonderland " -style without ever looking shocked . there are scenes in  reality  -- where a reclusive railway tycoon , burnett stone ( peter fonda ) , is being visited by his granddaughter lily ( mara wilson ) . their time together is interrupted by a distress call from the film s main character , mr . conductor ( alec baldwin ) , a midget pixie who uses a magic whistle to transport himself across the multiple universes he inhabits . these include shining time -- a whitewashed theme park of a town , whose residents wear zombie-like smiles and uniform clothing -- and the island of sodor , which resembles episodes of " thomas the tank engine " but has nothing to do with anything else in the movie . the plot follows mr . conductor s search for gold dust , which he needs to power his whistle . efforts to resupply keep getting thwarted by naughty trains like diesel , splatter and dodge , and he must speak to flowers , send supernatural spells to dogs and do a lot of other incomprehensible stuff to succeed . i found this hard to follow . kids will be so confused you might as well hand them the work of plato in the original ancient greek tablets . the actors deserve sympathy , too , because they had to pretend that it all made sense . baldwin is the most embarrassing -- wandering around on his own , attempting to breathe excitement into nothing in particular , talking as if to an imaginary friend . fonda delivers a ridiculous series of sentimental , deadly serious speeches ; he looks like he s trying to win an oscar , even though his lines are all similar to the following : " lady was the best steam engine in the world . . . ah , how i loved her . . . and my wife loved her , too . . . but diesel chased her . . . and her coal all ran out ! o god ! " " thomas and the magic railroad " was written , produced and directed by a first-time helmsman named britt allcroft . he should be ashamed of himself . projects like this -- incompetent and tortuous , but advertised as  family entertainment  -- not only insult children s intelligence , but eat away at them , causing devastation . kids will approach it with high expectations , because of love for the tv show ; then refuse to believe it s bad , convince themselves that it must be good , and that they just weren t paying attention . then they will slowly realise that , no , it was bad , and that they have been cheated and fooled . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantgani http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic '

" ) . if that seems like hee-haw humor to you , by all means , see the movie . if not , claim your place in human civilization with the rest of us . obviously , there are quite a few nonmembers of civilization who made this movie , like the first ace ventura film ( i use the word " film " only because it was filmed , not because there s any level of artistic merit . ) , a huge success . in fact , carrey only has a career because of the decline of intelligence in our culture . you may say to me , " but andrew , look at jerry lewis . he was born with a negative i . q . and look how popular he was thirty years ago . " maybe , but i still say jerry lewis is a notch or two up on the comedic ladder because he never actually did an impression in a movie of a rabid bulldog biting off a man s testicles . . . lewis at least had the dignity to save that performance for when company came over .

clinton u . s . distributor : columbia pictures wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day provided , of course , that you re the victim of a frontal lobotomy . there is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group . this is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core . wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 . i ve seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch . wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it s a thriller with a real story . what it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists . everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie . the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it . using this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once . that s not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what s around the next corner . the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex . both have an abundance of screen time , although i ll admit that the film s erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected . nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqué . the soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don t generate much heat . the lesbian kisses can t hold a candle to those in bound . theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad " no nudity " clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on ) . the film s greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower . maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs . kevin bacon ) is familiar with . the director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller , normal life . that movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script . it s difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker . but i suppose we all need to put food on the table . mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box-office disappointment ) . quick cuts and pretty sunrises can t even begin to cover up this movie s flaws . the main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida s blue bay high school . a student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him . one afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn . after confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) . they are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale . meanwhile , sam , convinced that he s being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help . the acting in wild things isn t very good , but none of the principals have much to work with . this is definitely not a character- based motion picture . not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i . q . , but it doesn t bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth . the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more . matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps . neve campbell gets to model the slutty look . denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see-through , one-piece bathing suit . and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon . the only one who s even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he s in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he s got the right idea ) . columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film s ending , which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ? wild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits , so stay seated ) , all of which are jaw-droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by . thanks to jeffrey kimball s polished , kinetic cinematography , wild things always looks great , and george s . clinton s score keeps it pulsing and throbbing . but , no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is , this is still trash , and , like all garbage , it stinks .

" up at the villa " feels like it was made to prove the point . if you removed every bit of its dialogue that strains to make sure we understand obvious details , the film would be half as long . that would be great for the authors , because they d have plenty of free space in which to insert a comprehensible story . kristin scott thomas stars as mary panton , a young english widow staying in florence at the advent of word war two . she receives a marriage proposal from sir edgar smith ( james fox ) , a man she does not love , but who could provide her with security . this point is emphasised by an american society lady , princess san fernando ( anne bancroft ) , who informs her guests " he has his qualities . . . " while rubbing her fingers together to make clear she s alluding to his money . of course , every minor point is emphasised in " up at the villa " . " surely he didn t come all the way here just to dance with you , " princess asks mary , while needlessly adding " he must be wanting to marry you ! " we understand what the characters are talking about , but the screenplay keeps providing them with unnecessary clarifications . my reviews have featured a lot of quotations as of late , because sometimes that s the best way to illustrate what a film is like . it s absolutely essential here ; the dialogue is the key point , drawing attention to itself by insulting our intelligence and cluttering things up . there is a love interest for mary in the movie , a playboy named roley flint ( sean penn ) . he too gets some awkward lines , the most memorable of which are spoken at a dinner party . the topic of conversation is electricity shortages . " it s because of the munitions factories , " says roley . " they re using up all the power . " so far , so good . but then : " they re preparing for war . the situation in europe is getting really tense right now . opposing countries are getting ready for armed conflict , and preparing arsenals of weapons . " as the film goes on , mary finds she needs to turn to roley for help : after she breaks the heart of a young austrian refugee ( jeremy davies ) , the boy shoots himself in her bedroom , and roley is needed to help get rid of the corpse . this part of the plot becomes the middle section of the film ; it s intended , i suppose , to show mary and roley getting to know each other . but it sidetracks the drama by bogging it down in thriller elements -- the characters are closely observed , all right , but as conspirators rather than potential lovers . the emotions of the film get confused and lost , and by the finale i wasn t sure what had happened . mary ends up with neither edgar nor roley , but is this intended as a sad or happy ending , and what made her come to her decision ? " up at the villa " was written , directed and edited by the husband and wife team of philip and belinda haas , who adapted the novella by w . somerset maugham . it s tempting to say that two people with an intimate psychological connection shouldn t work on a film together without some other significant creative influence , because they run the risk of making it so personal that other people won t understand it . but that s just not true -- think of the wonderful movies made by such auteurs as the coen , hughes and marx brothers . this is a bland and aimless film . i don t know why and i don t much care . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantgani please visit , and encourage others to visit , the uk critic s website , which is located at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic '
negativeC,' _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ ( pg-13 ) 1/2  ) two party guys bob their heads to haddaway s dance hit " what is love ? " while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub . it s barely enough to sustain a three-minute _saturday_night_live_ skit , but _snl_ producer lorne michaels , _clueless_ creator amy heckerling , and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution s recurring " roxbury guys " sketch that would presumably make a good feature . emphasis on the word " presumably . " _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that of viewers  patience levels . the first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original " roxbury guys " skits . with " what is love ? " blaring on the soundtrack , the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads , scope out " hotties " at clubs , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts . there is one crucial difference , however--these guys speak . that little fact has been used as justification for the film s existence , that the butabis  newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters . the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that s for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends . there is no story per se , only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots . the brothers literally run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club . there , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicuously uncredited--can you blame him ? ) , who takes an interest in an idea of theirs . meanwhile , the bros  overbearing father ( dan hedaya ) wants them to stop clubbing . when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father , a rift is created between the two . the narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny , but virtually none of it is . the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film , with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end . alas , the joke--a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_--will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film . granted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film s best joke is completely dependent on one s familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_ s lack of inspiration . that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves . like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , " the roxbury guys " is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context . after watching one of the " roxbury " skits on snl , this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to " what is love ? " , bump unsuspecting women , and . . . that s all . after watching _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ , you ll be left with exactly the same . '
negativeC,' set against the colourful background of the cappuccino culture of adelaide s fashionable rundle street , the low budget comedy spank ! is both an embarrassment and a disappointment . the main problem lies with the underdeveloped script from first time writer david farrell , and the lack of control over the material displayed by first time director ernie clark , making an inauspicious debut . nick ( mario gamma ) and his friend vinny ( checc musolino ) decide that they want to go into business together and open their own cafe . they enter into a partnership with wannabe local wheeler and dealer rocky pisoni ( vince poletto , recently seen in jackie chan s mr nice guy ) , who agrees to bankroll the enterprise . rocky has power of attorney over his ailing father s business . although he dresses sharply he has few clues about successfully running a business . he uses bully boy tactics to oversee his father s vast investments , but he is largely ineffectual . the dubious deal quickly comes unstuck as the characters  egos and personalities take over . nick is lazy and obnoxious , and thinks he s a real charmer with the ladies . vinny lacks money , and turns to his girl friend tina ( lucia mastrantone ) for financial help . she initially advises him against becoming involved in any dealing with nick and rocky . before long there is competition between the various players to open their own establishments . intended as a satire with something constructive to say about the rich diversity of ethnic culture and experiences in contemporary australia , spank ! misfires badly . clark has completely misjudged the tone and mood of the material , and this comedy actually has very little genuine humour . wogs out of work and head on explored similar issues and characters in far more emphatic and compelling fashion . clark , a former cinematographer , makes good use of locations to provide the film with atmosphere and character . but his lack of experience shows in the quality of performances he draws from his cast . the performances are pitched at a hysterically overwrought level in which stereotypes are reduced to the level of caricature . any nuances are bludgeoned into submission . poletto gives a completely unbelievable and outrageous performance as rocky , and his grating and unbearable character wears out his welcome even before the film is half over . gamma captures nick s overbearing personality beautifully with an energetic but unsubtle performance . robert mammone ( heaven s burning , etc ) plays paulie , the film s conscience , although his thoughtful and restrained performance almost seems to belong in another film . jo ( victoria dixon-whittle ) is a thankless cliché , a woman who dumps her narcissistic but wealthy lover , who treats her with contempt , for another man who treats her with respect . only theatre veteran mastrantone gives a more positive portrayal of a strong , modern woman with her performance as the independent , assertive and confident tina . for a first feature spank ! lacks spark , polish and spunk . it is a huge disappointment , especially when compared to the recent achievements of gregor jordan with his superb debut two hands . even the local distributors seem to have recognised its overall lack of quality and audience appeal , and have decided to release spank ! straight to video in melbourne and sydney .

negativeC,' starring heather donahue , michael williams and joshua leonard . directed by daniel myrick and ed sanchez running time : 1 hour 20 minutes arriving in a barrage of hype , the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year . however , like the golden child , although blair witch has made a lot of money , it s not very good . donahue , williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth . the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles . although events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on . although an interesting premise , the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity . the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise . most of the dialogue is ad-libbed , and still manages to sound like a poor b-movie . the  script  eventually degenerates into shouting matches , with the f-word included a lot to sound like students . there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur , but then it s back to the shouting and swearing , which gets very tiresome very quickly . if i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods , shout a lot and swear , i d go on scout camp . but no , the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this , but i m not quite sure how . the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting , especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes . with no music and no budget to work with , the film has to depend on natural , psychological scares , which are sometimes well delivered , sometimes not . i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film , although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film . however , because the actors are so irritating , the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying  what the f * ck is that ?   a lot , and mike giggling like a loony . there s also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things . the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment , and are hopelessly lost , heather still insists on filming it all . the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this , but it isn t very convincing . also , the students have no idea how to survive in the woods , such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation . there are also some parts where the  amateur  camcorder footage is obviously staged , heather s apology being a major one . the blair witch project , in the end , just fails to deliver . i suppose if you ve been lost camping before , the film may deliver some chills , but this is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven t been lost in the woods . apart from the final minutes , the film is mind boggingly unscary , and the shouting matches get hideously dull . the spook scenes are short and far between , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide . although a good idea , it s not executed well enough to be a fun , scary cinema experience . it s a worrying fact when the website ( http : //www . blairwitch . com ) is better than the film .

negativeC,' if someone had told me that a movie starring richard gere and sharon stone as a married couple would be low-quality , boring , unsexy , and incongruous in every way , i d have laughed in his face . know what ? intersection is everything i ve just mentioned . gere stars as vincent eastman , a successful architect who runs a joint business with wife sherry , played by sharon stone . vincent is absolutely unhappy with his life and marriage , as he tells a friend , " we weren t a family . we were a corporation with a daughter . " it s easy to see why vincent would want to leave his wife for another woman , the sensual red-head olivia ( played by lolita davidovich ) . he s obviously very in love with his mistress ; vincent plans to build a new home for them , get married , and have children soon thereafter . a terrific beginning . a wonderful set-up . we see vincent driving along a slick road after a rain storm at high speed , letter in hand , smiling . what about ? without giving too much away , during the opening moments of the film , gere s character has made an important decision regarding what he s going to do with the rest of his life . he s on his way in that direction when he slams on the brakes and plows into three different cars before tumbling his own vehicle off the side of the road . that s the story . that and that only . what fills the remaining eighty minutes of the film is flashbacks , lots of them . we see gere with his wife at home and in the office . we see gere with his daughter , gere with work associates , and gere with his mistress . flashbacks and flashbacks . flashbacks intertwined and within one another . after a while it s difficult to tell whether or not anything is actually happening at the time we are watching , in the present . and it s even more difficult to give a damn . this is one hell of a free-form movie . that s fine , if that s the way you want to go with the material , so long as you weed out the unnecessary from the . . . well , in the case of this film . . . not-so unnecessary . give it all some meaning , at least . that s what i would have done , anyway . unfortunately i wasn t in charge of production . i would like to say that intersection is about the memories of a dying man ; the memories of him and the woman he truly loves , and why he wants to be with her and her alone . i can t say it . even when we re sure he loves her , we aren t quite positive . i d love to say that this movie will entertain you in some fashion , but i can t . what i can say of intersection is that it was almost a complete waste of my time . anything else i could say would be a waste of yours .

negativeC,' simply irresistible tries really hard to recapture the feel of an old- fashioned romantic fantasy . in fact , it tries too hard . the film wants to be soft , cuddly , and loveable , and succeeds only in being incredibly stupid . i m usually kind to this sort of film , especially when there is a wonderfully charming lead performance such as sarah michelle gellar delivers here . unfortunately , her performance is comppletely wasted since the film does not provide her with a leading man that is a tenth as interesting as she is . gellar stars as amanda , a chef at her small family restaraunt that is going out of business . one reason is that she can t cook very well at all . one day some guy gives her a crab ( i m not making this up ) , and all of a sudden crazy things begin to happen such as her food actually tasting great . people start flocking to her restaraunt and she has a hard time keeping up with all the customers . sean patrick flanery is an upper class businessman who is planning on opening his own restaraunt . he stops by amanda s one day and is entranced by the food , eventhough his girlfriend breaks up with him at the same time . amanda is instantly attracted to him and they begin to fall for one another . this is helped by the magic of the food , which creates a thick vanilla fog , and has them floating off the ground . flanery s character is one of the most confusing leading men in a romantic comedy in quite some time . at first he loves the fact that they are rolling around kissing in the vanilla fog . when they start to float , it s too much for him . he claims that he wants to be in control of his own destiny , and refuses to be with her alone again . whenever she tries to get near him , he shouts at her and calls her a witch , like he s in salem or something . what the hell is this guy s problem ? who wouldn t want to roll around and kiss sarah michelle gellar in thick vanilla fog ? who wouldn t want to be holding her as the two of you float off the ground ? it doesn t help that flanery has absolutely zero charisma . his character annoyed me so much at times i had to look away from the screen . surprisingly , the only other interesting performance comes from patricia clarkson , as flanery s assistant . i very much disliked her annoyingly mannered performance in high art . but here she strips away all the extra baggage and allows her natural personality to come through . i found her to be rather charming in a classy , sophisticated way . clarkson and gellar do their best to make this featherweight film palatable , but they receive very little help . the film does have some nice photography . they sure got the look of a old-fashioned romance right . but the most important thing in any romance is chemistry , and despite gellar s best efforts , there is none to speak of . other than some nice photography and two fine performances , simply irresistible offers nothing for even the least discriminating of viewers . larry mcgillicuddy - the cinemaniac http : //members . xoom . com/lmcgill/movpage . htm '
negativeC,' warning : may contain slight mild spoilers . rated : r for intense violence/gore , some strong sexuality and language . starring : arnold schwarzeneggar , robin tunney , rod stieger , gabriel byrne . we go into a movie theater , boom ! the lights go down , our hearts race , we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we ve been waiting to see for a long time comes on . we sit there , watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is . why shouldn t i have know what i was getting myself into . again like this past summers hit " stigmata " , " end of days " may be worse . it s not like this is any kind of original idea , it just throws in some " rosemary s baby " , along with " the devil s advocate " a little " exorcist " and some " stigmata " here and there . whala you have " end of days " a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific . sadly but truly again like most recent films , all the good parts are in the trailers . the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend , and flop in the next . jericho cane ( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role ) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan ( living in gabriel byrnes body ) and stop him from impregnating christine york ( robin tunney ) because if he does , and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist . he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 , and strangely he s trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes . he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger ( in a terrific role ) and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that s satisfying , but turns into a typical action movie . that s pretty much it on plot . it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie , and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it , parts you have to wonder where all the money went . as for arnie ? good role , ok performance . i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts . the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film . in the trailers it looks like a good scary , action film and ends up being a boring , long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions . gabriel byrnes ( who ironically played a priest in " stigmata " ) here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character . two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun " the devil s advocate " and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also . robin tunney ( great performance as always ) plays satan s main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child . of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn t nothing new . the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown , though not nearly as the visual style was in " stigmata " . here we are given great camera work , and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just don t work in this movie . the script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines , but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home . only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances , the writing and visual style , but the storyline and the finished product don t work as well . the sad thing is that " end of days " had so many things going for it . the plot could have been more organized , the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind-numbing . at times it seems like " armageddon " and started to get old and tiresome . hollywood is running out of ideas bad , and like i ve always said before needs new ones . even with its 100m budget " end of days " is less than pleasing . in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over , and easily could have had a 70m budget . maybe i sound crazy , but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film , and hope that they make it as good as the original . we need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box-office . we need to get more films like " the blair witch project " that could scare people to death , while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch . overblown effects , stupid and thin plot-line , good performances , disappointing . . . . umm yup those pretty much describe " end of days " . reviewed by brandon herring november 23 , 1999 . brandon herring http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/movie/3160/moviereviewheaven . html '
negativeC,' i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard . the problem is , i can t remember them as i write this review . that s not a good sign . in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can t really describe , because i don t know that much about him . i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn t like relationships , just " booty calls " at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) . bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz s direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! ) . rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it s going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki s friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met . to make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki s obsession with safe sex . first she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them . oh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin . back to the store . now they ve got to get dental dams , or there ll be no foreplay . why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ? nikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she d better be making these demands , too . talk about coitus interruptus . booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies . the difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality . in this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane ! at the extreme . there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention . it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting . there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? ) does not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing . for instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant . bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone s surprise . however , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery . this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene . if , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , " kung-fu movies , " and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective . this is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable . by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit . the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions . why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ? why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ? if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn t she have some condoms at her own apartment ? these questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward . a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language . some movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character s pattern of speech . other films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves . booty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn t work . they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them . half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason . the chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler . this is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long . it s too bad that the core of the film isn t much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog . i refer you to the first paragraph of this review .

negativeC,' and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn t pretty . this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas s the three musketeers . by bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . the end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . d artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . in paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu s man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer s wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king s prison . d artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . director peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it s a disaster . one problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . jet li s high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . ironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . chambers  d artangnan isn t a musketeer -- he s a mouseketeer ! and hyam s use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that s the only standout in an overall flat production . '
negativeC,' talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! spice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls . it s intended as a sort of hard day s night , but ends up simply hard to watch . when watching the spice girls , i m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name . the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented . there s ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you re almost certain the post sticks out her throat . the film itself doesn t really have a plot . it follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their " first live performance " at albert hall . the action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas . the various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even when they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff . whew . for some reason , the film is littered with star cameos . from elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf . heck , even roger moore shows up , though he can t decide if he s parodying himself as james bond , or if he s lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld . richard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band s manager , clifford . the celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film . neither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring . their songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos . my advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either option will be more enjoyable than the film . non-fans should know to stay well away from this one . '
negativeC,' capsule : potentially interesting story rendered dull and coldly distant by david lynch s perpetually smug and alienating style . there are better ways to be conned . watching lost highway , i kept thinking about a picture puzzle that you spend a week trying to solve , only to discover half the pieces are missing . i felt conned ; i d lost two and a half hours of my life over a movie that added up to exactly nothing . everything in lost highway cancels itself out . there are people who have argued this point with me at length , insisting that was what the movie was about . i disagree , because lost highway doesn t even bother to enlist our attention long enough to be about anything . it is a self-important and boring film that builds in its own excuses for being and never tells us what they are . the story actually has an intriguing presence . a jazz musician ( bill pullman ) and his wife receive a series of videotapes in the mail . someone is walking around filming their house . then the stranger gets bolder and starts filming the * inside * of the house as well . eventually , the tapes show pullman having murdered his wife -- and sure enough , guess what s happened . pullman is sent to prison , but while awaiting execution , he has a series of bizarre lynchian experiences in his cell and morphs into someone else ( balthazar getty ) , a young punk . nobody can explain it , but they have to let him go . that doesn t mean they can t keep an eye on him , of course . as i said , all of this is potentially interesting . not in lynch s hands . everything i described is stretched out to fill the entire first hour of the movie , which slithers by * so * slowly and lingers on every insignificant gesture * so * painfully that by the time we get to the change-over , all interest in the goings-on has been buried . the actors are not bad in their roles -- they re just made into zombies . i was reminded of the way robert bresson -- the french director with an almost paranoid loathing of actors attempting to supersede the director s vision -- who made his actors repeat scenes until they simply did them with mechanical precision and no attempt at personification . except that bresson had a larger vision to communicate . lynch has nothing that we can discern , save the urge to be artfully bizarre . the other day i saw begotten , a movie with no dialogue and no real storyline that succeeded excellently in being enthralling . why did that work and lost highway fail ? probably because begotten was purer and not beholden to anything remotely familiar . lost highway is so obviously david lynch indulging himself to no good end that we re alienated and fed up in short order . david lynch has made two , possibly three films that i enjoyed : eraserhead , which was probably the best showcase for his homegrown surreal nightmares ; blue velvet , which actually set up a story in the midst of his pretentions , and the elephant man , which made the most sense and was the most human . everything since , and no doubt from now on , has proven to be a waste of time , and to be honest i m not one to mourn .

negativeC,' steve martin is one of the funniest men alive . if you can take that as a true statement , then your disappointment at this film will equal mine . martin can be hilarious , creating some of the best laugh-out-loud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters . you won t find any of them here . the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit . bilko ( and the name isn t an accident ) is the head of an army motor pool group , but his passion is his schemes . every episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hair-brained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base . " mchale s navy "  s granddaddy . that s the idea behind this movie too , but the difference is that , as far-fetched and usually goofy as the television series was , it was funny . there is not one laugh in the film . the re-make retains the goofiness , but not the entertainment . everything is just too clean . it was obviously made on a hollywood back lot and looks every bit like it . it all looks brand new , even the old beat-up stuff . martin is remarkably small in what should have been a bigger than life role . in the original , phil silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold and more than a touch of sleaziness . martin s bilko is a pale imitation . the only semi-bright spot is phil hartman as bilko s arch-enemy . it s not saying much , considering martin s lackluster character , but hartman leaves him in the dust .

" 54 " belongs in the elite group of films known as " the big disappointments " : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished . i was heavily awaiting " 54 , " not the least because i ve become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that s been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this " edgy " film . perhaps more importantly , " 54 " is part of the blossoming subgenre , " the 70s nostalgia film , " which has been picking up mighty steam , what with " boogie nights " and " the last days of disco " coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from " boogie nights , " and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from " the last days of disco , " not to mention several others . " 54 " deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that s all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it . this is a definite plus . here s a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening . the story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let s look at how it all affected the people . but this film doesn t let that happen . it gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o shea ( ryan phillippe , from " i know what you did last summer " ) , who s chief character trait is the fact that he s from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) . he s dim-witted , into being part of " the scene , " and soon finds he s become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a bit like " saturday night fever , "  cept no travolta and no real interest put into him . poor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been . shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from " clueless " ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame . although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that s all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film . the film s sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) . rubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that . notice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who ve only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails . first time feature director mark christopher proves that he s a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much . his story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject . it s as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route . the studio s recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough . some people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film s tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini s " la dolce vita " ) , and when i watched " 54 , " i didn t particularly want to stay .

negativeC,' for more reviews and movie screensavers , visit http : //www . joblo . com/i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews , and in both instances , he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon . now , i personally remember those films as a ) starring a major motion picture star b ) being funny c ) having great action sequences d ) great chemistry e ) decent character development . hmmm . . . . okay . . . now on to my review of chill factor . plot : a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex-army general , to propose a nuclear device to international prospects . when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps , they must keep it cool on ice , and rush it over to an army base , before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit , and kills millions of people . critique : " speed on an ice-cream truck " is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one-tone movie to its backers , but unfortunately , the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension-filled , original two hours of cinema , is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film , and the lethal weapon movies , stood for . this film is seasoned in cliches , with plenty of badly written dialogue , over the top acting from cuba gooding jr . , zero chemistry between the two leads , and horribly tacky bad guys , tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe . my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent , because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously " written " , that we just had to crack up . that , and the formula for the film s script which followed the proverbial 1-2- , and you guessed it . . . 3 scenario ! and what about all those catchy , hip names to get us to relate to the characters . . . . " elvis " and " nighshift " , oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters ( and yes , it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel ) . it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr . got involved in this one-week-old-blue-cheese-smelling project . did they actually think that it would boost their careers , or did they know that the script sucked , but discounted any fall from grace , knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall ? most probably the latter . have you seen either fled or bulletproof ? well , despite the slight differences in plot , the essentials are basically the same here . you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people , having no choice but to work together to get somewhere , hating each other at first , but over time , learning to respect one another as individuals . yawn . add to that , the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black , drive black cars and black vans , and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head . not too conspicuous , eh ? call me a party-pooper , but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy , this film just doesn t even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining . one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside , and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island , do not a fun , buddy-action flick make .

negativeC,' american pie 2 ( 2001 ) . starring jason biggs , chris klein , shannon elizabeth , alyson hannigan , natasha lyonne , thomas ian nicholas , chris own , tara reid , seann william scott , mena suvari , eddie kaye thomas and eugene levy . story by david h . steinberg and adam herz . screenplay by adam herz . directed by j . b . rogers . rated r . approx . 115 minutes . american pie 2 is filled with laughs . but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater . i m no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy . but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment , not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself . what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart . of the original , i noted it was " a warm , pleasant outing about the travails of growing up . " well , the quartet of chums - jim ( jason biggs ) , oz ( chris klein ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) - have grown up . at least they are a year older , but don t seem any wiser . fresh from their first year of college the quartet , along with the obnoxious stifler ( seann william scott ) , rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score . as usual nothing goes right until the last reel . but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women . and american pie 2 is rather degrading to women . for the most part , they are not shown as individuals . they are nothing more than potential recipients of over-active , raging hormones . it is telling that the most normal couple , oz and heather ( mena suvari ) spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex - she s overseas on an exchange student program . despite having been to college , jim is still klutzy and awkward , unsure of himself around the opposite sex . most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him , including a painful episode involving an instant glue-like substance . also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates , whom the boys suspect of being lesbians . it is offensive and plays upon outdated , adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs . the first film , despite some raunchy moments , had an innocent charm to it . the sequel is more cynical . it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them : the many mentions of finch s encounter with stifler s mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy s return as jim s well-meaning , trying-to-be-hip dad . the only performer who is actually given some new , fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle , the band geek from the original . in the sequel , she imbues her character with vulnerability , wisdom and maturity . american pie 2 is a pre-sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office . it is a shame , though , that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz , who also penned the original , could not have set his sights higher . american pie 2 is funny , but it s still a comedown as well as a letdown . bob bloom is the film critic at the journal and courier in lafayette , in . he can be reached by e-mail at bloom@journal-courier . com or at bobbloom@iquest . net .  other reviews by bloom can be found at www . jconline . com by clicking on golafayette . bloom s reviews also can be found on the web at the internet movie database : http : //www . imdb . com/m/reviews_by ? bob + bloom '
negativeC,' the mechanics of a film like  firestorm  are pretty basic . it isn t like you would expect a brainstorm of ideas to revolve around such a simple and mundane premise . therefore , you have to count on the film having a well executed blend of stunt work , editing , photographic expertise , and it should , at the very least , have a brisk pace .  firestorm  doesn t have any of these elements in the proper place . in a somewhat shameless and pitiful way , it passes itself off with the trademark elements of a television movie . the shaky camera angles , an obviously low number of takes , murky photography and cheesy special effects are all presented in a protracted and scattershot manner and many of the movie s bland action sequences are clumsily executed and in a movie involving fire , you almost need a magnifying glass to see any of the important moments . former nfl celebrity and present day football analyst howie long stars ( barely ) as a wilderness firefighter who confronts a renegade group of escaped prisoners , disguised as firefighters , who are using a forest fire as the perfect cover for a getaway scheme involving the recovery of millions of dollars hidden away just before their leader was caught and sent away to prison . william forsythe plays the villain leader ( barely ) who enlists the aid of other prisoners to help him recover the money but kills each one of his helpers along the way so he doesn t have to share the loot with them . tagging along for the ride is a nature photographer ( suzi amis ) who becomes embroiled in long s fight against the bad guys after long rescues her from forsythe s gang after she s kidnapped and tells long during their hike through the forest that she s the daughter of a tough marine and learned a lot from her old man . where s the incredible hulk when you need him ? rounding out the cast is the veteran actor scott glenn who is completely wasted as a colleague of long s in the fire fighting game who suffers a career ending injury and has to make an embarrassing sacrifice during the film s climax .  firestorm  is unbelievably anaemic and has some of the worst computer enhanced gimmicks so far in the technology of motion pictures . it s credibility is strained by so many phony fire related elements that you ll wish you had a little device with you that s marked " break glass in the event of boredom " . there are countless scenes where some of the cast members would have become overcome by smoke inhalation and died long before they get out of their entanglements and other scenes that depict debris landing on them , in front of them and around them would have been equally fatal in a real scenario . the only thing worse than this movie would be to see it turned into a movie theme park ride which actually may be more entertaining than sitting through this . thankfully , it s less than 90 minutes . wow ! it really does resemble a t . v . movie !

" the blair witch project " was made with a budget of $1 . 75 and exploded on the screen , raking in huge profits . the concept was brilliant . the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real . the film itself was even more convincing . the movie _must_ be authentic . why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen ? the first film caught lightning in a bottle . the sequel proves you can t pour that old lightning into a new bottle . you have to give this effort some credit . it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids . it would have been easy , but of course , it wouldn t have worked . instead " book of shadows " acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release . it s a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel . unfortunately it doesn t work either . five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film . weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives . even weirder stuff happens . some people die , there s blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense . while supposedly doing serious research , the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation . then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud , very obnoxious heavy metal music . it s a bad plan . the cast shows some early promise . a couple is doing research on a " blair witch " book . the tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado . a goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief . the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick , the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick : the cute wiccan chick . the first film s unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods . this time , these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors . there s not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason . although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea , it s ruined by poor execution . the follow-up to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie . they re trapped in an old big weird house . they stupidly separate into various rooms . there are strange noises , they see scary apparitions and people disappear . ever see this movie ? seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better . the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore . for a storyline filled with surprises , it s oddly predicable . " the blair witch project " was a rare triumph of style over substance . " the book of shadows " is a triumph of tedium over promise .

negativeC,' an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer . you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage , which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it s hollywood existence . when i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys . the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves . all of the monkeys combine their efforts , hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark s office . the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark s desk while flailing his arms and shrieking . the director appears to be deep in thought , until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it ! ! !   the writing behind this project is embarrassing . for your amusement , i will explain the plot . dr . kinder ( kathleen turner ) and dr . heep ( christopher lloyd ) are two of the cold-hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute , where peculiar studies are going on . as the story goes , there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ( ages 2 and under ) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences . when they move past this phase , they become like any other drooling toddler . kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies , namely little sylvester ( sly for short ) , who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission : impossible team . there is so much crap derived from this premise , despite the fact it s virtually identical to the plot in look who s talking ! ( a far superior film in any league ) . you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene . sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung-fu tactics . question : it s obvious the babies are super-smart , but why are they able to fight like jackie chan ? ? the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers . it s a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes  familiar home alone formula . i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90 s knowledge , quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors . the effects in baby geniuses ( similar to the talking animals in babe ) are pathetic , the editing is a disaster , and the jokes are never funny . the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute  . i suppose they are . i can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute . other instances , though , i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script . there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever ; their entire existence is based on punch lines . peter macnicol and kim cattrall , as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester s twin , are both miscast . then again , i don t suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid . meanwhile , dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench ( hahaha ) . i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs . instead of watching this , i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling . or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark-infested waters . anything to avoid this painful movie . the final line in the film , spoken by the bratty sylvester , is `if they think i m doing the sequel for less than $20 mill , they re nuts  . sequel ? please have mercy .

negativeC,' for his directoral debut , gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent , alcoholic husband and father , and the various lives he affects . but while the characters , places and events may have special meaning to the writer-director , the audience is left in the dark . the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) , and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him . he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars . then , he returns home to his pregnant wife , valerie ( kathy burke ) and their five-year-old daughter . raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies ( and his paranoid delusions ) early on when he accuses valerie s brother , billy ( charlie creed-miles ) , of stealing . raymond then proceed to beat ( and bite ) him to a bloody wreck . but these are the least of billy s problems . billy is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it doesn t seem that he ll last much longer . billy and valerie s mother , janet ( laila morse ) , is raymond s nemesis . she disapproves of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anything about it . she merely struggles on , hoping her children will survive their respective torments . if this description seems bleak , i haven t told the half of it . this is not a cheery movie , and most of the time it s downright depressing . while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick , and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him , in the end , it s not quite worth it . there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose . take for example the extended sequence where one of billy s scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy . the film is filled with these " character moments " that never really achieve anything . granted , there are a few genuinely powerful ( and sickening ) moments in the film , but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us . the actors do a fine job , particularly in the central roles . the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes , and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into . the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there s no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices . a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience . oldman got it about half right .

( if this doesn t sound like a classic western you re right . ) the film follows the two men s lives until one character dies , by the time we get there , we don t really care . there are three problems in the hi-lo country . one , harrelson seems to have his role written exactly for him . rather than seeing harrelson s big boy character when i looked on the screen , i saw woody harrelson playing the same type of woody-ized character that he always plays . this also goes for arquette , who s role seems patricia-ized for her and reminded me constantly of her alice character in lost highway . two , the film is boring . so boring in fact , that i believe my minutes of film to yawn ratio is 6 : 2 . three , the film plays in no particular order , showing us a handful of random events that don t have any meaning to what happens in the conclusion . add some sappy drama , and you ve got another bad western , the hi-lo country gets  stars .

negativeC,' rated on a 4-star scale screening venue : odeon ( liverpool city centre ) released in the uk by fox on february 11 , 2000 ; certificate 15 ; 118 minutes ; country of origin usa ; aspect ratio 2 . 35 : 1 directed by danny boyle ; produced by andrew macdonald . written by john hodge ; based on the novel by alex garland . photographed by darius khondji ; edited by masahiro hirakubo . danny boyle is one of the most hyperactive boors in modern cinema , the film director equivalent of someone who d take your arthritic father to a rave , forcibly make him dance to the horrible music and claim to be promoting social integration between the generations . he takes gritty works of literature , which are filled with reality and truth , and shakes them up into shallow feature-length pop videos . obviously he paid attention in film school , where they teach you conventional hollywood structures and cheap tricks that please mass audiences ; if only he d realise you re supposed to move on after you graduate . boyle first trampled on a great book with " trainspotting " ( 1996 ) , a grotesquely lively romp based on irvine welsh s epic study of drug addiction in inner-city scotland . now the filmmaker , and his team of writer john hodge and producer andrew macdonald , have brought us an adaptation of alex garland s " the beach " , in which leonardo dicaprio plays richard , an american backpacker disillusioned by the tacky westernisation of foreign culture . he walks through the cities of thailand shaking his head at the hustle and bustle of yapping market traders , café bars full of people watching television , and vulgar drunken tourists . in his fleapit hotel , the kid is kept awake by the sounds of a crazed scottish pot-head who goes by the pseudonym of daffy duck ( robert carlyle ) and raves about a perfect beach which has so far been kept secret from these ruinous tourist crowds . he takes a liking to richard , though , and gives him a map to this paradise before killing himself . richard and his french travelling companions , étienne ( guillaume canet ) and françoise ( virginie ledoyen ) , do eventually get to the place daffy promised them , and settle into the beautiful locale , which is populated by young folks just as sick as they are at the state of traditional holiday destinations . their community is rather sophisticated -- everyone has work assignments , there are group meetings , huts have been well-built -- and yet more than anywhere else these people have been , their island offers them the opportunity to absorb parts of the world that haven t been trodden on . one of them describes it as a " beach resort for people who can t stand beach resorts " . the dream doesn t last , because inevitably people do find out about the place , and try to come . this invokes the violent anger of the dope farmers on the other side of the island -- an added devastation to the lives of our beach-dwelling friends , who have already begun to destroy their own peace by developing hostile paranoia about their privacy . in his book , garland found all the right notes to tell this story ; he knew that the experience of paradise found and lost had to really happen to the reader , so it had some emotional charge and didn t just become a pretentious cogitation on man s tendency to ruin the gifts god gave him . his hero was a perceptive , down-to-earth brit we could identify with . the beach society was made up of people looking for clean fun , not a bunch of freaks with some twisted revolutionary ideology . and their downward spiral emerged gradually , tragically , out of reasonable concerns that got out of hand . boyle and company , however , plunge enthusiastically into every pitfall possible . the middle passages of their film should settle into beach life , capture a feeling of tranquillity and make us hope that it can last ; instead , the happy part of the plot is covered in a short montage where we see snippets of activity and hear dicaprio s narration tell us how everything was going fine . consequently the madness and carnage of the latter passages come from nowhere and mean nothing . the condensed structure , the introduction of irrelevant romantic subplots and the brief dialogue make " the beach " a film of plot , which is a mistake , since it should be one of journey . the production design and photography are impeccable , and dicaprio s intense screen presence is always fascinating . strange , then , how bland and superficial the film feels ; i think it s because boyle jumps around instead of absorbing atmosphere , and is working from a screenplay without any well-defined characters or key moments . the experience of reading " the beach " and then seeing the film resembles the plight of the characters -- they found something wonderful , rejoiced in it , and then saw a bunch of careless bastards trample it into bloody pulp . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantganiplease visit , and encourage others to visit , the uk critic s website , which is located at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic '
negativeC,' warner brothers ; rated pg-13 ( mild violence , sexual situations ) ; 132 minutesscreenplay : gerald di pego ( from the novel by nicholas sparks ) cast : kevin costner , robin wright-penn , paul newman , illeana douglas , robbie coltrane , jesse james , john savage . i m not an overly cynical guy . there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years . however , i have my limits and i also have standards . this brings us to the subject at hand : message in a bottle , the big ticket romance that warner brothers  unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine s day . the story , what little of it that there is , involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne ( robin wright-penn ) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason ( jesse james ) . during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean . the letter , written to a mystery woman named catherine , instantly captivates her . upon her return , theresa shares it with her best friend lina ( illeana douglas ) , her boss charlie ( robbie coltrane ) , and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it ) . it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down . he turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing . this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship . of course she doesn t tell him that she found his letter , she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love ) . this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened . the discovery of the message and garret s discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film . there s a truly lame subplot about garret s relationship with his dead wife s family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother , played by john savage ) and then the necessary tear-jerking ending . a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die , although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel . the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed since . . . well , since costner s the postman ( 1997 ) . message in a bottle is one slow moving film . last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this . they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work . message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they re fighting the material all the way , and losing badly . costner and , especially , wright-penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring . they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry . the supporting players are given very little to do . the reliable douglas is particularly wasted . old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film . a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played . however , too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are . the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story . gabriel yared , who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient ( 1996 ) and city of angels ( 1998 ) with his scores , overdoes it a bit here . caleb deschanel s camera makes everything look a little too beautiful . do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly ? the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times . the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego . working from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times . its strict adherence to clichés brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) . there simply isn t an original scene in this film . the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking . this is director mandoki s first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) , the solid meg ryan/andy garcia romance . he s simply going through the motions with this . message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come ( 1998 ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade .

negativeC,' " you damn dirty apes ! " that s just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes that s taken on a comedic context over time . no one back then seemed to realize how over-the- top charlton heston s acting style was , but it shows now , particularly in this " mystery science theater 3000 " wannabe that was taken for a film masterpiece in its time , actually winning one oscar ( for makeup , no less ) and being nominated for a couple others . it also spawned multiple sequels like beneath the planet of the apes , escape from the planet of the apes , return of the planet of the apes , beneath the escape from the return of the planet of the apes , planet of the apes : the next generation , police academy of the apes . . . the list goes on . heston is an american astronaut who spends a few thousand light years in space with his three companions and ends up on a planet not too dissimilar from earth . the thing is , on this planet humans can t talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species . heston s companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned . he surprises them all with his gift of speech , making two primate scientists ( roddy mcdowall and kim hunter ) believe heston is the missing link between ape and man . believe me , we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years . when the two apes present the idea before a judicial counsel ( the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans ) , it is received as heresy , for all good monkeys know god " created ape in his image . " but heston has already seen a cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species , before apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president . and he takes them there , holding up a baby doll and yelling , " if humans couldn t speak , then how do you account for this talking doll ? ! " and how do you account for your acting ability , mr . heston ? the absolute most laughable scene comes with the movie s surprise conclusion . i won t reveal the details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees on a beach and yelling " god damn you all to hell ! " several times in succession . the movie is atrocious and should only be viewed by those members of society who like to watch bad movies and laugh at them . what makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony , a condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution . but let me tell you , if darwin could see the ape masks and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges ( heston [to female ape] : may i kiss you before i go ? ape : but . . . you re so . . . ugly . ) , he d convert to creationism on the spot . luckily for us , science-fiction movies have evolved over time to the point at which some of them are actually good .

( que he hecho yo para merecer esto ? ) ( spain , 1984 * ) written and directed by pedro almodovar . cinematography , angel luis fernandez . art direction , pin morales , roman arango . editing , jose solcedo . music , bernardo bonezzi . cast : carmen maura , angel de andres-lopez , veronica forque , gonzalo suarez , chus lampreave , juan martinez , miguel angel herranz , amparo soler leal , luis hostalot . a tesauro and kaktus coproduction , released by cinevista . in spanish with subtitles . 100 minutes . no rating . pedro almodovar , who has been emerging in the 1980s as the naughty boy of spanish cinema , may baffle you with what have i done . . . , but he will also amuse you and instruct you . the film s mixed-genre is something that unsettles habitues of commercial spectacles . although our desire to classify what we see makes us wonder where exactly this movie fits ( from scene to scene--and within scenes --it swings from farce to drama and from comedy to tragedy ) , the unorthodox effects build up into a coherent absurdist whole , somewhat like a play by eugene ionesco . gloria is a woman in her thirties . she would be attractive were she not so harried . she lives in a cramped apartment within a monstrous low-cost housing development . co-existing around her is a gallery of individuals , each of whom is outrageous in a different way , each of whom is worked into the plots and subplots of the movie . there s antonio , the chauvinist pig taxi-driver husband who is hung up on german songs by zarah leander ( the darling of the nazi era ) ; who has a talent for imitating handwriting ; who once forged some letters of hitler to a mistress , when he ( antonio ) was a chauffeur in germany and sleeping with his lady employer . there s the older son who deals drugs and the younger son who goes to bed with his classmate s father . there s antonio s stingy old mother ( played with filmic effrontery by a young woman in opaque glasses ) who s hung up on sweets and mineral water ( " with lots of bubbles " ) and sells part of her stock to her son , as needed . across the hall is sexy cristal , gloria s only friend and a whore . another neighbor is a seamstress who hates her former husband and takes it out on her cherubic little girl . the child has telekinetic powers . if movies had a face , this one would have a deadpan expression . in a series of off-the-wall crises , the film proceeds imperturbably , treating the most outlandish or immoral events in casual fashion . ill-husbanded gloria , long on household slavery and short on household money , also works as a cleaning woman . she pops uppers to steady her nerves . as the picture opens , she has a sexual encounter of the last tango in paris school . later , one of her husband s fares who also happens to be one of cristal s clients , hires her for himself and his brother . the man is a failed writer whose wife is another failed writer as well as a kleptomaniac . he hatches a plot involving antonio and another nazi forgery . his brother , a psychiatrist who ought to be seeing a psychiatrist , counsels an impotent police inspector who is in and out of everyone s life . gloria lets a pederastic dentist adopt her junior son so that the youngster may have a better life . grandma adopts a lizard and baptizes him " money , " the most important thing in life . that s only part of the criss-crossings where each individual gets by hook , crook , or arbitrariness , involved with several others , but is hardly involved in any concern for others . it takes a while for us to sort things out in those concentric circles , to realize that the shifting center of the movie is gloria , to see that the main point is a feminist one about the still-unliberated woman in spain . women may have come a long way since franco died , but they still have a much longer way to go . almodovar , performer , cartoonist , writer and filmmaker , conducts his movie like a series of mad yet cool improvisations . what have i done . . . . may remind you in some ways of underground features , of the work of american director paul bartel , of gonzo journalism , of the dark humor of bunuel and other spaniards , but it is essentially an original work . the french new wave--by now old but staging a welcome comeback via contemporary imitators in britain and elsewhere--may also come to mind , with for example , almodovar s asides on top of asides . some of those are obviously relevant . others are indirectly relevant , like the very funny parodies of neo-hispanic tv commercials which comment on the ludicrousness of the media and the way they stultify the public . others yet ( like a man who makes car noises ) look like inventions that were too good to pass up--so why not throw them in ? as you watch this film , you may go through different stages , including one where you think that there s overkill , but keep going and the purposes of almodovar s exaggerations fall into place . paradoxically , as matters become increasingly surreal , social criticism becomes increasingly real . i will not reveal all the ins and outs of the plot , but when a hambone and police investigators get involved , not only does this in with the opening sequence in a " kendo " ( martial arts ) academy , but also with a once-famous black humor story by roald dahl , first printed in the new yorker magazine many years ago . * in keeping with its subject ( s ) , the film has provocative tastelessness at times , and always a voluntarily garish look , from the amateurish opening credits in strong , primary colors , to its defiant use of unsophisticated lighting set-ups . the closing shots of the building complex may or may not be a reference to godard s denunciation of soulless low-cost housing and living in his film one or two things i know about her . but anyone who knows european public housing will see the validity of those simple , emblematic images . in speech and deed , there s much bawdiness , with parodistic sex scenes and rabelaisian glee at bodily functions and references to them . the subtitles try much too hard to render the spanish slang into english slang , with unintentionally funny results and misspellings : you get sonny for sony , smak for smack , nitwuit , or cryptic things like " my j ug . " what i have done is not a " finished " product by ordinary standards . i say this as a compliment to its convention-defying nature , to its maverick power , the method in its madness , and the consistently ironical view of a world which is askew . it is certainly one of the most interesting films shown in the us in 1988 . ------------------------------------------------------- review written in 1988 . * 1996 addenda : ( 1 ) many sources in us film guides give it erroneously a 1985 release date . ( 2 ) the roald dahl story and/or its main trick found their way into tv programs of the alfred hitchcock presents type , as well as in features . '
negativeC,' copyright 1998 nathaniel r . atchesonthe corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence . it s not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , but it doesn t make a shred of sense . and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ? james foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor . but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train . at least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role . chow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop . he s a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he s very familiar with chinatown . that s probably why the powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) . nick and danny begin by stepping on each other s toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one s life . what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me . i m fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) . i m also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff . i m not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way . there s also an interesting subplot revolving around danny s father ( brian cox ) , but it doesn t have much to do with the main story . one of the problems , as i said , is that the movie doesn t make any sense . i don t blame this entirely on foley , because he s obviously a good director . i m more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci s script , which doesn t seem to be in tune to the way normal people act . one scene early on had me particularly annoyed : nick confronts his boss because he s angry about his new white partner . he s shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me . ( in addition , the film takes a bite into race-related issues , and never develops them at all . ) there are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent . there s also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents . the plot itself never straightens out . i m not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group . the corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences . the sequences aren t bad , but they re not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ? on that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ? one too many , i d imagine . foley s strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here . the scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together . chow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep . wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he s still fun to watch . i also liked the subplot involving danny s father ; brian cox s performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny . but the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly-familiar action scenes . a complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it s over . the corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until , finally , there s nothing left to hold on to .

negativeC,' directed by danny cannon . cast : jennifer love hewitt , brandy , freddie prinze jr . , matthew settle , mekhi phifer , jennifer esposito , bill cobbs , jeffrey combs , jack black , muse watson . 1998 - 96 minutes . rated r ( for violence , gore , profanity , and drug use ) . reviewed november 14 , 1998 . by dustin putman  dustin putman s film reviews  so much for sweet returns . after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80 s slasher movies , starting with 1996 s " scream , " and followed by " scream 2 , " " urban legend , " and the original , " i know what you did last summer , " a film like , " i still know what you did last summer , " was bound to be made sooner or late . it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out , and that is because they reached for the lowest-common-denominator in filmmaking , favoring non-stop deaths and gore for suspense , and trading in fleshed out , likable characters for one-dimensional nitwits . it has been exactly one year since julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis , a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road , and then , thinking he was dead , dumped him into the ocean . since then , julie has relocated to boston university , and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams , she has been able to put her life back together . when julie s friend , karla ( brandy ) , is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is , she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people , which also includes karla s horny boyfriend , tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend , ray ( freddie prinze jr . , also returning from the original ) , doesn t show up . when they reach the secluded island , they discover it is the last day of the open season , and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them . of course , julie , her friends , and the workers aren t the only ones there , as the murderous ben willis , dressed in fisherman garb , returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all . it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like , " i still know what you did last summer , " is made . i am a very big fan of horror movies , and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to " ikwydls , " which i am a fan of , is almost an exact replica of a " friday the 13th " movie . while the original focused more on the story and characters , as well as genuinely suspenseful moments , thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson ( who didn t return to write the sequel , and it shows ) , " i still know . . . " has no story to speak of , and is so vacuous of ideas , that the filmmakers , were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested . also gone are any signs of character development , and since every single character died before i got to know them , all i was left with was to stare at the screen , indifferent to what was going on . while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original , it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died . they were all paper-thin and pointless , except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman . another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set-pieces , like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar , but there are none to speak of in this sequel ( although they do come close at one moment with brandy ) . since so many people were killed every couple minutes , the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water . also of note is the mystery of the second killer , and accomplice to ben , but it is obvious from the first frame who it is , and so i couldn t even have fun at that , like i did in the " scream " movies and , " urban legend . " it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again , a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else . maybe the people who made , " i still know what you did last summer , " should have realized that in order to make a good movie , you must have a screenplay---or at least one that isn t such a black hole for thoughts and ideas . the ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part , but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel , everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead .

negativeC,' united states , 1998 u . s . release date : 5/20/98 ( wide ) running length : 2 : 12 mpaa classification : pg-13 ( typical monster movie disaster scenario ) theatrical aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 cast : matthew broderick , jean reno , hank azaria , maria pitillo , kevin dunn , michael lerner , harry shearer , arabella field director : roland emmerich producers : dean devlin screenplay : dean devlin , roland emmerich cinematography : ueli steiger music : david arnold u . s . distributor : tristar pictures godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the " who cares about plot " summer movie . a loose remake of the 1954 " classic " japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin s big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind . the script isn t just " dumbed down , " it s lobotomized . godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone . presumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage . that s not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they re just not as readily susceptible . this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors . stargate was a financial success . independence day was a runaway hit . and , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it s virtually guaranteed at least $100 million . nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid . godzilla isn t completely without merit , although it is close . there s a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly . frankly , while the special effects are competent , they re not all that stunning . there s nothing new here ; it s jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure . maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level . godzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone . the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity . ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) worst of all , godzilla isn t even exciting . with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn t a sequence in this film that raises the pulse . even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking . independence day may have been dumb , but it was full of " adrenaline moments " capable of getting the audience involved in the action . in this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking . actually , part of the problem is that we re never sure who we re supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him . the plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply . after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple . he does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway . in the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams . on hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla . in his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific . in nick s words , godzilla is " a mutated aberration an incipient creature the first of its kind . " as luck would have it , nick s old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station . along with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla . then , just when the military has rejected nick s theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment . instead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city . unfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it s becoming boring . the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall . he could climb the empire state building . at ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over . godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor . there s an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick s last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel . both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : " ebert , " the mayor of new york , is played by michael lerner , and " gene " ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager . ebert s re-election slogan is , not surprisingly , " thumbs up for new york . " the siskel/ebert stuff is amusing the first time it s used , but , after a while , it grows tiresome . and , although the " characters " don t serve any real purpose , they keep popping up . godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast . this is largely because emmerich doesn t want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard . that s not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren t capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past ) , but they aren t a-list names . then again , considering the quality of the writing , even pacino and deniro would have been hard- pressed to shine . maria pitillo ( dear god ) plays the love interest and hank azaria ( great expectations ) is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief . ultimately , it doesn t really matter what i ( or any other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movie . tristar has assumed that godzilla , like all self-proclaimed summer event motion pictures , is pretty much critic-proof . it may also be word-of-mouth-proof . those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say . so , when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time , it s like spitting into the wind . emmerich and devlin are master illusionists , waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors . it s probably too much to hope that some day , movie-goers will wake up and realize that they ve been had .

" --quentin tarantino well put . that s exactly what happened to me right in the middle of " u-571 " . submarine movies are inevitably going to be claustrophobic , sweaty , noisy and dark -- tension turns this into masterful entertainment , confusion kills it . the setting is world war two . a squad in the u . s . navy , led by bill paxton and matthew mcconaughey , have been ordered to seize a german u-boat that carries the radio codes used by nazi submarines to plan attacks on allied shipping . the movie opens with a cliché -- introducing us to all the boys at a big gala , before an urgent telegram comes in , informing them to return to their posts -- but there was still hope for the film at this point , because it has a promising appearance , with period texture perfectly captured . people looked , talked and walked differently in the 1940s ; they had different ways of eating , washing , learning , wearing clothes . many period films just plant obviously contemporary figures among archaic props , but the director of " u-571 " , jonathan mostow , gets the details just right . there is tension on the boat before the big attack . it s a risky assignment , having to seize this sub , and these guys are sailors , not combat soldiers . if it goes wrong , not only is everyone dead , but the germans will change their codes and tighten their security , and that may have implications for the outcome of the war . at the decisive moment of action , when the americans sneak onto the german boat by posing as a supply ship , i got completely lost as to what was going on . one of the sailors plants dynamite somewhere , and we can t tell if he s supposed to be doing so or not . something explodes elsewhere , and the cause is never made clear . someone thinks they ve found a code book , and we re not sure if they have or not . a load of americans end up in the water for no reason , and they don t swim the few metres back to their sub , they just scream and drown . why ? this isn t one of those battle scenes that s supposed to disorientate us . it s an incompetently shot beginning to the film s middle section . so , with my umbilical cord severed , i found it hard to watch the rest of the film , with the guys in the submarine shouting impenetrable jargon and running around tight spaces , often with no clear purpose . the scenes i did manage to follow were repetitive and silly : every now and again a new obstacle would come up , and mcconaughey would give an order as to how to combat it . two of the other men would take separate turns to repeat these instructions verbatim , in hushed awe . it would be carried out to the letter , and work . then they d repeat it back to themselves , and say " phew ! " even some of the visual effects are shoddy . i m amazed that hollywood seems to be going backwards in this respect -- two or three years ago complimenting a movie s technological wizardry seemed redundant , but now , with releases such as " battlefield earth " on our screens , we seem to have returned to the days of shoddy " star wars " rip-offs . " u-571 " has a torpedo attack that looks like it was shot by a kid throwing toys at a camcorder in the bathtub . and in the shots where people are supposed to be drowning , they look awfully in control : remember the scene with the rubber octopus in " ed wood " ? i feel sympathy for mostow , who spent eight years of his life on this project , and has come out with something that can t be taken seriously . it did fill me with respect for world war two veterans , but only in the sense that if their experiences were anything near as stifling or boring as the movie , then it s amazing they managed to carry on making important strategic decisions . the end credits reveal , by the way , that it was the british , not the americans , who were actually the heroes of the german code-breaking operation . how nice that the filmmakers thought to tell us . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantgani please visit , and encourage others to visit , the uk critic s website at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic '
negativeC,' much ado about nothing . ah , how sweet the irony ! it s accepted wisdom in some circles - among english literature nuts , mainly - that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance . he just doesn t " understand " shakespeare , you will hear them say . the bard s work is apparently beyond criticism . what a load of old cobblers . if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh s film of shakespeare s " comedy " much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word , it s time to get a life . get monty python . get woody allen . get john waters . whatever . just get a real taste of some clever , witty , risky comedy . and banish this nonsense to where it belongs . drama and tragedy was shakespeare s strength . to my sensibilities - and i m no stick in the mud - much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever . no kidding : this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going . the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend , as this was our day out and i hadn t seen her in ages . but boy , does she owe me one ! i won t spend too much time on the plot . basically , we follow the trials and tribulations of two would-be couples - one young , the other older . there s some dark treachery amongst all this , but everyone is so awfully jolly that you d hardly know it . mind you , there s nothing wrong with the basic story . good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound . nothing wrong with most of the cast , either . branaugh , emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers . the problem is the script , or more accurately , shakespeare s original text . light comedy shouldn t be complex . yet wrapped in elizabethan english , the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend . for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good , undemanding laugh . the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves , the actor once again miscast as a jealous half-brother or something . but when dissected and understood , what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame . this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold . ho , ho , ho , boy likes girl ! ho , ho , ho , men are such klutzes ! ho , ho , ho , she s so awfully clumsy ! oh please ! there s wit in here somewhere , i m told . i call it pretentious . something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay . in the end , it s cringeworthy . watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience . comedy ? bah , humbug !

" honest " is too confident and professional to really be called bad , but it s still a bewildering mess . there s too much going on in terms of art direction and too much going nowhere in terms of plot , and although it s intended as a star vehicle for the pop group all saints , two of them are hardly ever onscreen and the third plays a character who hides her feelings . i have a question for the four screenwriters : what the hell is this movie about , why does it take so long to get going , is it comic or dramatic , and who is the main player ? those all saints girls -- nicole appleton , natalie appleton and melanie blatt -- play three sisters in the east end of london in the 1960s . they dress up as men and pull armed robberies , but the folks in the neighbourhood don t know this , and think they re just a bunch of harmless young tarts . during one botched heist of a magazine office , an american hippie journalist , daniel wheaton ( peter facinelli ) , captures and then proceeds to fall in love with nicole s character , gerry . most of the movie is taken up by him following her around , and her telling him she s not interested ( but not why ) , and then he gets entangled in a big violent chase , as the girls  criminal pasts catch up with them . this probably sounds dull and confusing , and it is , not least because it s all that happens in the movie . things take forever to unfold , and yet somehow nothing is ever fleshed out . the three sisters never have a conversation that tells us anything about their personalities -- all their lines are questions , answers , orders or points of information . the script tries to use some of gerry and daniel s exchanges to compare the revolutionaries of the 1960s with the unchanging working class , but nothing much is made of this theme , because " honest " does not give us a convincing re-creation of its time . it doesn t so much take place in the 60s as in one of those " austin powers " -style pieces of production design overkill that pretend to be the 60s by teeming with joints , psychedelic polka-dot clothes , people saying " far out !

negativeC,' the original kings of comedy ( 2000 ) / directed by spike lee . starring steve harvey , dl hughley , cedric the entertainer , bernie mac . running time : 115 minutes . rated aa for mature subject matter and coarse language by the mfcb . reviewed on september 12th , 2000 . that s a cliche , to be sure , but it s also true . much of it comes from the fact that the act of killing is reasonably straightforward , whereas making people laugh is considerably more elusive . and , by extension , it s because while being dead is a pretty objective state ( certain metaphysical concerns notwithstanding ) , being funny is a lot more personal and subjective . what i find absolutely uproarious might be stupid or silly or just plain boring to somebody else . sense of humour is as individual as we are . as such , i will not really attempt to assess how funny " the original kings of comedy " is . i will merely indicate that i didn t find it at all amusing . certainly , there were moments which elicited a few chuckles , but i spent most of the film s nearly two-hour duration sitting in my seat slack-jawed , wondering what i was missing . because not only does the audience in the movie clearly love the act ( it d be a curious concert film otherwise ! ) but many others at the screening i attended got a kick out of it too . so the humour in the picture clearly has an appeal -- just not for me . all that said , though , there are aspects of " the original kings of comedy " which are candidates for discussion and which are not quite so subjective as the quality ( or lack thereof ) of its humour . it is in many ways a very flawed undertaking and while those who appreciate its brand of comedy may be able to overlook this , it makes the experience all the more intolerable for those who do not . " the original kings of comedy " is spliced together by director spike lee from two performances in charlotte , on february 26th and 27th of this year . the show consists of four respected ( if not exactly famous ) black comedians plying their trade . dl hughley , cedric the entertainer , and bernie mac are presented in single individual segments running about thirty minutes each . introducing each act is steve harvey , which is to basically say that harvey gets three separate ten-minute blocks of stage time to put on his act instead of an unbroken half hour like the others . the picture is also peppered with brief behind-the-scenes clips which add little to the proceedings as a whole . the film s major problem is the sheer lack of variety amongst the four comedians , virtually all of whose humour runs along similar lines . all four indulge in lots of " black people versus white people " commentary ( which is often hilarious , but gets really tedious on its umpteenth iteration in the span of two hours ) . all four stay confined to very broad-based topics , largely eschewing any political or intellectual commentary . and all of them lace their monologues with an endless litany of profanity . whereas the best comedians know to use swearing to punctuate their punchlines , here it is often used in place of one : a much lower brand of humour for sure . further , there is little insight offered through the jokes . there is a lot of racial content , but it mostly consists of potshots at caucasians and/or african-americans . certainly , we are afforded only the barest of glimpses into what it is like to be a black man in america . these comedians are happy to talk about the world around them , but reveal precious little about themselves in the process . most of the comedy is of sitcom variety , and while this is fine in half-hour doses on prime time television , it feels like an opportunity wasted in a major motion picture . the comedian who comes closest to achieving some sort of relevance with his segment is bernie mac , who discusses the effects of his sister s drug habit on his family ( he is now sharing custody of her three children with his brother-in-law ) . unfortunately , mac couches this portion of his monologue in exceedingly unpleasant jokes , constantly referring to his six year-old nephew as a " faggot " and talking about physically beating his own child . mac s brand of humor is extremely edgy , maybe too much so ; it makes for an uncomfortable performance which straddles the line between comedy and cruelty and , perhaps , goes a little too far . mac s half hour also illustrates the restrictions imposed by recording the film in a live environment . mac has a thick accent ( as does cedric , to a lesser extent ) , and i found that the concert s sound facilities -- obviously a poor comparison with anything that would be taped in a studio -- often distorted his words to the point of unintelligibility . lee is also occasionally forced to choose some rather poor camera angles , though in general he does a good job of setting things up to capture the performers at the best possible angles . of the four comedians , i found harvey s material the best . this may have been aided by the fact that , alone amongst the quartet , his screentime is split up , so that he does not overstay his welcome . intriguingly , harvey s best material comes when he is adlibbing to the audience . for example , when a rastafarian-looking man in the front row tells him that he s doing computer technology education , harvey retorts that the last two words that come to his mind when he looks at the man are " technology " . . . or " education " . he also has a few amusing rehearsed skits , like one about black people on the " titanic " . but good gags like this are few and far between . i found " the original kings of comedy " to be an unpleasant morass , a sterile waste of a long two hours . maybe my sense of humour just isn t geared in the right way . maybe i m not the demographic that the " kings " are appealing to . i guess much the same reaction would be had if newfoundland s comedy troupe buddy wassisname and the other fellers were dropped off in the south bronx to do a show . if you understand the reference , i expect you ll see the point . if you don t understand the reference . . . well , maybe that makes the point , too . copyright © 2000 shannon patrick sullivan . archived at the popcorn gallery , http : //www . physics . mun . ca/~sps/movies/originalkings . html _______________________________________________________________________ / shannon patrick sullivan | " we are all in the gutter , but some of us \ | shannon@mun . ca | are looking at the stars .

negativeC,' cast : howie long , scott glenn , william forsythe , suzy amis , christianne hirt director : dean semler producers : thomas m . hammel , joseph loeb iii , matthew weisman screenplay : chris soth cinematography : stephen f . windon music : j . peter robinson u . s . distributor : twentieth century fox i can think of three reasons why howie long will likely never be a major action star : 1 . he doesn t have a hard-to-decipher accent , 2 . he doesn t always speak in a monotone , and 3 . his face doesn t always wear the same impassive expression . in short , the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad , but too bad to be good . unfortunately , the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle , firestorm , which is just plain awful . one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woo s broken arrow ) is that he s so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery . as ace firefighter jesse graves , long is supposed to be playing a bigger-than-life action hero -- the kind of he- man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers . unfortunately , despite the best efforts of first-time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner s work in the postman look stark , jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy . to put it kindly , this is not a well-written motion picture . firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clichés which , taken together , form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot . the only reason this film is getting one star ( instead of something lower ) is that most of the fire sequences are realistic , and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively . we re introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people . during this sequence , our big burly hero proves that he s also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog ( yes , the dog lives ) from being broiled alive . flash-forward a year . now , our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association , replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins ( real actor scott glenn ) . but this day , our big burly hero s first in charge , isn t going to be business-as-usual . a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom . led by randy earl shaye ( william forsythe ) , the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border . along the way , they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress ( suzy amis ) . eventually , our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire , rescue the damsel in distress , defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , and restore order to the galaxy . firestorm s director , dean semler , is a former cinematographer ( he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves ) , so it s no surprise that the film looks good . unfortunately , that s firestorm s lone asset , and it falters near the end , when computer-generated special effects fill up the screen . these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game . the action sequences , which include a variety of chases , are occasionally interesting , but never invigorating . everyone , including long , appears to be going through the motions . there isn t a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end , unless you count the forest fire , which generates some heat . as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , william forsythe lacks panache . he s worse than a generic bad guy ; he s a boring generic bad guy who doesn t have any snappy one-liners to hurl at our big burly hero . my advice to scott glenn ( absolute power ) and suzy amis ( titanic ) is to accidentally forget this film the next time they re making out a resume . there s some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list . ( at least i hope there aren t 10 worse films than this . ) and i know i wasn t the only one who really disliked this movie . as the audience was filing out of the screening , i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments . the general consensus seemed to be that , although the movie sucked , the promotional key ring was cool . the problem is that fox won t be giving out key rings to regular movie-goers , so that nixes any reason to see firestorm .

negativeC,' year : 1999 . starring edward furlong , giuseppe andrews , james debello , sam huntington , lin shaye , natasha lyonne , melanie lynskey , shannon tweed , kiss ( gene simmons , paul stanley , ace frehley , peter criss ) . written by carl v . dupré . directed by adam rifkin . rated r . one of the responses those that enjoy " detroit rock city " ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i ve given the film might be something like : " oh , that casey s gone and become a jaded critic on us . just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n  roll movie like this ? " i m wondering the same thing . i feel like i should have had a grand time with " detroit rock city . " it s the sort of movie i wish i could ve had a lot of fun with , but i didn t . i just didn t . surely this film isn t trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? no , but i expected something . a funny joke . a clever prank . a plot development . anything . the movie never delivers . you ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . " detroit rock city " is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film s existence , and it s not a very satisfying realization . the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . that s it . there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . they have a garage band . they re pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n  roll , so i guess that means we root for them . they have tickets , they lose them . they get more tickets , they lose those too . they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . there s not much more to it . frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys  hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . she doesn t want them to see kiss , if you hadn t figured that out already . it s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . we ve got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . then again , " maximum overdrive " had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . " detroit rock city " doesn t quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . in fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc s " highway to hell " sounds like something my neighbor s cat coughed up ) . it s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it  s evident that they re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they ve got to make a living in hollywood . people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . director adam rifkin knows he hasn t got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . we get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . it s fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . i would recommend that those who felt seasick at " the blair witch project " stay far away from " detroit rock city , " because the witch has got nothing on this baby . i haven t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since " armageddon . " and what about that script ? it s written by carl j . dupré , which sounds like as made-up a name as i ve ever heard . if it is , i can t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . a plotless , pointless rock n  roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . the jokes in " detroit rock city " rarely are . in fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it " comedy . " there is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . it s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , " see ? funny ! " look , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . see ? funny ! look , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . twice . see ? funny ! look , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . see ? funny ! a word of advice to mr . dupré : no , these things aren t funny all by themselves . they must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn  t predicted them five minutes in advance . that s it , i ve said enough about this movie . it s a waste of time and money . i liked the music , but don t bother buying the soundtrack . i hear it  s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . you want to see this concept executed well ? go rent roger corman s 1979 classic " rock n  roll high school . " it features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show . yes , go rent that , and skip " detroit rock city , " which will probably bomb , and deservedly so .

negativeC,' directed by : roger christian written by : l . ron hubbard ( novel ) , corey mandell once in a great while there comes a movie which is regarded as an instant classic . movies like " ben hur " and " the godfather " were known to be great films the moment they hit theaters . roger christian s " battlefield earth " , based on l . ron hubbard s thousand page epic , is not one of these movies . " battlefield earth " is more akin to " plan 9 from outer space " ; a movie so incredibly bad that it will one day develop a cult following . " battlefield earth " is a movie words cannot adequately describe . i hate to say this , but i truly believe it must be witnessed to be fully appreciated . most bad films have at least one redeeming quality to them ; whether it be unintentional laughs , one truly good scene , or some interesting special effects . this movie somehow manages to possess no redeeming qualities . i must admit , it s not an easy task creating such a movie , which is why they only come along once in a great while . appreciate this movie for the few weeks it will be in theaters folks . you ll not see another one like it for a great while . it s the 31st century , and man is an endangered species ( so the opening credits tell us in a cheap , green home computer font ) . the psychlos , a race of nine foot tall whiners , have taken over the planet in a battle which took only nine minutes . now , 1000 years later , there are only a handful of humans remaining , and they are used as cheap labor by the psychlos , led by the maniacal terl ( john travolta ) . a lone woodsman , jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) , is on a quest to find what happend to his people when he is captured by the alien invaders . found to be somewhat intelligent by the psychlos , he is trained in how to speak their language and handle their machinery . tyler soon decides that he must lead his people in a revolt or the human race will become extinct . with nothing but his wits , a few fellow captives , some explosives , and a handy fleet of harrier jets , he leads his people in a final strike against their oppressors . let me start by listing the things i liked about this film . okay , now on to the rest of the movie . you can tell from the opening titles that you re in for a very bumpy ride . the picture leaps right into its narrative without explaining anything . instead , we meet barry pepper s ( " saving private ryan " ) character , and before we know anything about him , he is off on his quest . in fact , there is no emotional involvment with any character in this movie . at one point , terl has captured tyler s girlfriend and threatens to kill her if tyler doesn t obey him . i think this was supposed to be an emotional scene , watching tyler grapple with how to save his girlfriend s life . the problem , however , is that we know next to nothing about tyler , and his girlfriend has just been introduced so we couldn t care less about her . things are even worse with tyler s comrades . they die all the time without anyone really knowing just who died . everytime anyone dies , the music blasts through the theater , the characters scream silently , and the audience stares at the screen in complete confusion about who just bit the dust . allow me to now list everything that is wrong with this movie . the scenery is obviously fake and created mostly from models or really bad mat jobs ( watch for the mat job on a scene where a character falls off a cliff ; it s laughably bad ) . the special effects look like they were done on the same home computer used for the opening credits . the costumes consist of cheap looking furs for the humans and shoddy silver things for the aliens ( travolta manages to appear even more overweight in his costume ) . the battle scenes are shot entirely in slow motion and with no sound . these fights consist of watching humans and aliens getting hit by little white bursts of light which bounce off them but cause the victims to fall dead to the ground ( except jonnie tyler , who gets shot numerous times but always springs back ) . the dialogue is amazingly cheesy , and is made even worse by the over-the-top performances from all the cast members . the score is quite obnoxious , booming dramatically through the speakers all the time regardless of what the characters are doing . barry pepper raises his hand , the music booms dramatically ; barry pepper eats a raw rat , the score plays so loudly you ll be vibrating in your chair . there is much more to hate in this film , but i don t have room to mention it all in one review . in case you re wondering just who roger christian is , allow me to give you a quick biography . christian is the fellow who directed 1997 s " masterminds " , and little else . he also worked as a crew member on the first " star wars " movie , which would explain his affinity for using wipes . the problem is , while george lucas may have used all sorts of different wipes throughout the " star wars " movies , christian uses the same wipe over and over again in " battlefield earth " . the wipe starts in the middle and goes outward , again and again , between nearly every scene . not only is it amateurish to use the same wipe repeatedly , but it s a cheap looking , unimaginative wipe . the actors are given very little to do , and they chew the scenery like you ve never seen . barry pepper , who was interesting and a little creepy as the christian sniper in " saving private ryan " , is given nothing to do as the always grunting jonnie tyler . john travolta overacts like you ve never seen before , and rather than appearing menacing as i believe was intended , he looks like an eight foot tall clown . only forest whitaker ( " ghost dog : the way of the samurai " ) , playing terl s henchman , appears to realize what a horrendous movie he is in . for nearly any science fiction film , a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is necessary . " battlefield earth " requires more than any other movie i have seen in recent years . nearly every scene contains some ludicrous idea that an eight year old wouldn t buy . try this out : the psychlos are interested in mining gold from a mountain , and they use the humans to do so . jonnie tyler , being the genius he now is , takes bricked gold from fort knox and gives it to terl in place of the gold they didn t mine . there are two serious oversights here . first , terl actually believes that tyler smelted the gold into bricks for him ; second , terl s scanners could find gold ore in a mountain , but he couldn t find any sitting in a demolished fort knox ? not ludicrous enough for you ? try this one on for size : tyler and his troops just happen to find a fleet of harriers sitting armed , fueled , and in perfect working order after one thousand years . tyler s men , who could barely speak intelligibly not too long ago , then proceed to learn how to fly them like experts in less than a week . there are dozens of examples like these two , but i ve wasted enough time writing about this stupid movie . i d recommend " battlefield earth " to aspiring directors so they can see how not to make a sci-fi movie , but to no one else under any circumstances . the movie runs a torturous 117 minutes , and i give it one out of five stars . any past movies you want me to review ? send to : johnbeachem@dependentfilms . net for past reviews , movie news , and other fun stuff , visit : http : //www . dependentfilms . net * * * * * - one of the best movies of the year . * * * * - great flick , try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie , hits and misses . * * - pretty bad , see it at your own risk . * - see this one only if you enjoy pain .

negativeC,' director : luis llosa cast : jennifer lopez , ice cube , owen wilson , eric stoltz humanities quest for knowledge never ends . so a team of scientists and film-makers travel to the amazon to search for a legendary indian tribe . the party consists of anthropologist steven cale ( eric stoltz ) and the camera team consisting of terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , danny rich ( ice cube ) , gary dixon ( owen wilson ) , denise kahlberg ( kari wuhrer ) and warren westridge ( jonathan hyde ) . early on their journey they meet paul sarone ( jon voight ) whose boat is stuck on the shore . they agree to give him a ride to the next village . he claims to know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe . very soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out to be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant anaconda and sell it to a zoo . we don t have to wait too long for the giant snake . she just had a panther hors d oevre and now is looking for the main course . our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard . no wonder giant animals mistake their splashing for a dinner bell . our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp . enjoy ! so much for the first attempt to catch her . but who would want to catch a giant snake with a fishing pole ? our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake . too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition . one by one she goes after the others . eric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure . the rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned . however the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring . whenever the leading lady shows up we re in for a laugh . the snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous animated movie even if she should be an awe-inspiring monster . her attacks always follow the same plan : one last hypnotic look - she s looking at you , kid - then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down . mostly we don t see the act of devouring . but she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part . whoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes . maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real . the animatronics are somewhat more believable . but that didn t work for the strangling scenes . don t go see the movie for the f/x . they are everything but up-to-date . the viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his/her surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team . we may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work . a well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits , but i will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its reputation . the majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credits start rolling , anyway . what kind of audience is the target group for this movie ? hard to say . this can t be a serious horror movie , or can it ? see for yourself . '
negativeC,' species is a forehead-knockingly bad movie . you know what i m talking about : that s when you sit there , slack-jawed , staring at the screen , and then just pound your first into your forehead in total disbelief at what you re witnessing . it s so awful it s downright charming ; it s about as bad and as * loud * as stargate . here s the " plot " : scientists recieve a transmission from space that seems to consist of a genetic code . after synthesizing it and crossbreeding it with human dna , they develop sil : an innocent-looking , wide-eyed girl-thing who , for reasons too protracted to list here , has to be destroyed . only trouble is , they can t simply put a gun to the back of her head and turn her into dog food -- like a bond movie , they have to kill her * elaborately * , which gives her a chance to escape . the government corralls together a team of " experts " -- mostly at screwing up , from the look of it : an assassin ( michael madsen , looking even dopier than he did in resevoir dogs ) , an empath ( forest whitaker , looking like the pillsbury doughboy ) , another scientist , and the creator of sil ( ben kingsley , the best thing in the movie ) . most of them will of course be murdered in various creative ways , but not before they get to show their various " skills " . smithson , the empath , for instance , has the uncanny ability to just spit out where sil is and what she s doing . thanks to the fact that his skill doesn t have any explicit rules , it leaves us scratching our heads as to why he doesn t just produce a map and draw an x on it . sil , as it turns out , is growing and developing at a furious rate -- which , of course , requires that she murder several people to feed herself . which is nothing compared to the vigor she exhibits when trying to find a mate . the adult sil ( played by natasha henstridge ) looks like she just walked off the runway of a fashion show and has no trouble finding nookie in california , and the movie gets some good laughs out of everyone reacting to her total guilelessness . there is also one moment -- maybe salvaged from an earlier , better draft of the script -- where she tries to to explain who she is , and can t . but the main purpose of the movie is never in doubt : violence , gratuitous nudity , ear-hammering sound effects . the last one is really ticking me off in a lot of movies lately : why , for instance , do we alwasy have swooshing sound effects to accompany the image of a flashlight playing across the camera lens ? light beams didn t disturb the air much the last time i checked .

negativeC,' can you say " dated " ? you can if you ve seen rosemary s baby which , like the exorcist , was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release . " mystery science theater 3000 " has skewered the bad films of the past , but let me tell you , it could do a number on the " good " ones too . rosemary s baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good-looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success . it all seems so harmless in the beginning . mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed . ( there s also a skull in the living room , but it s only for decoration . ) their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming . all s well for about the first hour of this slow-moving film , until mia eats some of the neighbors  chocolate mousse and passes out . when she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen . it seems like a dream and , when she finds herself pregnant , she almost forgets about it . and everyone s helping with the pregnancy . the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink , a good-luck charm for her to wear around her neck , and the name of an obstetrician who s been in the business 66 . 6 years . meanwhile , mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight . before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries . that s when you know your health s failing . the only person in the movie who s the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend ( maurice evans ) who calls mia up to give her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma . by about the two-hour mark i felt the same way . rosemary s baby is way too long , and leads up to a payoff that s about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie . i guess someone put a spell on this movie .

negativeC,' there are certain rules in hollywood involving the portrayal of romantic relationships on the big screen . certain combinations of leads naturally go together  handsome men and beautiful women being the predominant pairing . lately , a trend has emerged involving cute young adult males and lovable teenage females ( usually with shows on fox or the wb ) and , once in a while , moviegoers are treated to the unlikely affairs of rickety old men and chicks half their age . stars are always fit , have great teeth , skin and hair , and are usually white . films that stray from these templates of success are generally resounding box office failures . why ? because people won t line up for number 18 with hunan foot , the touching story of a chinese guy with a really large head who falls in love with a 70-year-old lady leper . they will also reject mommy , i m taller than daddy , starring a middle-aged single mom with a huge raised birthmark on her face and her lucky find  a midget with one eyebrow and a cowlick . howard stern has made a career out of shining a spotlight on those aforementioned oddities . until now , if you wanted to hear a drunk dwarf , paranoid stutterers or alien lesbians , howard was the only place to go . hollywood could only ignore his phenomenal ratings for so long . so , along comes the other sister (  ) , a film that bills itself as `a romantic comedy for the emotionally challenged .   translation  a love story about two retards . they meet . they fall in love . the have a fight . they get back together . they get married . and they drive off with their car dragging a `just lobotomized !   sign . okay , i made that last part up , but it would have been more original than anything in sister s tiresome script . the film opens with carla ( juliette lewis , natural born killers ) having just graduated from the roselake , a school for mentally-challenged children . carla flies home to san francisco , where her father ( tom skerritt ) and overbearing mother ( diane keaton ) seem intent on keeping her at home under a watchful eye . they live in a giant house with a live-in maid and a gate , so one has to wonder why they didn t just lock her in the attic . like the kennedys . but carla has other plans . she wants to enroll in a public vocational school . her parents say no but eventually give in . she wants her own apartment . her parents say no but eventually give in . she wants a boyfriend . her parents say no buthey ! are you tired of reading this yet ? try sitting through 130 minutes of it . lewis is remarkably unremarkable as carla . but , then again , carla isn t too far off of the roles that she usually plays . her love interest daniel ( giovanni ribisi , saving private ryan ) is much better , but also not much different from his recurring role of phoebe s brother on friends . actually , the only difference is fake teeth . keaton s mother is purposefully and pleasantly annoying while skerritt is just plan scary sans facial hair . sister was written and directed by garry marshall , who hit the big time with 70s television shows like mork and mindy and laverne & shirley . his resume as of late boasts the blockbusters dear god and exit to eden . this is the first script he has written since 1984 s the flamingo kid , proving that writing must not be like riding a bike . but , hey  if you watch with your eyes closed , it sounds just like howard . 2 : 10  r for adult situations and mild languageplanet sick-boy : http : //home . eznet . net/~jpopick '
negativeC,' i m sure that there is something to behold within the personality and act of the late andy kaufman . but i just don t see it . director milos forman s 1996 bio pick on the life of pornographer larry flynt is a seriously under rated and brilliant film that didn t get the credit it deserved . i never liked larry flynt or the things he did but his right to free speech was and is absolute and although i never liked his lifestyle , i still thought the film about him is a classic and it was my favourite film the year it came out . so my dislike for  man on the moon  has nothing to do with the way i feel about andy kaufman . this is simply a one dimensional and totally non lethal motion picture that never finds a way to tell its story above the level of mediocrity , a quality a lot of people thought andy kaufman possessed . the first thing that has to be noted is the casting of jim carrey . it came down to casting either him or edward norton . carrey looks more like kaufman that norton but what s really disappointing about the movie is that instead of jim carrey playing andy kaufman , carrey plays andy kaufman playing jim carrey ! and shame on the powers that be for selecting carrey over a real actor simply for box office reasons . andy kaufman ( 1949-1984 ) died at the age of 35 of lung cancer and the film opens in the late 1950 s when he is just a boy and shows how he always had the desire and ambition to become a performer . the film then zips forward to the mid 70 s when kaufman is in his mid to late 20 s and how he got his start in the profession of stand up comedy . this is how the film begins its downfall . it fails to avoid mirroring its own subject and can t find a way to be a grand piece of film making and can t elevate itself very far to give its structure depth and remains totally mediocre for two hours . there is also no room for real characterizations . carrey as kaufman is the only mildly interesting character in the entire movie . danny devito plays his agent , george shapiro and is neither colourful nor absorbing . courtney love , who was so good in  the people vs . larry flynt  isn t introduced in the film until almost a full hour into it and never shows any strong characteristics in a very pivotal role . aspects of popular culture cannot be explained to people . you either see the art of you don t . it s like the andy warhol contribution of the campbell s soup can as art . no one can explain it as you either see it or you don t . the only contagious part of  man on the moon  is the pro wrestling reference . as a fan of pro wrestling myself , i thought the segments involving andy kaufman and jerry lawler were worth watching . pro wrestling is like a male soap opera with circus like performers who make it big based on personality and microphone skills rather than pure wrestling talent . again , when realizing this , you either see the concept or you don t . another aching part of  man on the moon  is that it spends too much time showing kaufman in his stand up performances and his antics on stage , including the creation of a character kaufman created named tony clifton . carrey brings aspects to the andy kaufman portrayal by using scenes from  ace ventura : when nature calls  ( the bongo playing ) and  the cable guy  in the way he showcases clifton . there is a scene in  the cable guy  where carrey , dressed up with bad hair and a bushy moustache , beats up a guy in the men s room in comic fashion . carrey looks like that and acts like that in his portrayal of clifton . there is too much jim carrey on screen and not enough andy kaufman . all of kaufman s involvements with the entertainment industry only scratch the surface , except for the pro wrestling stuff . there was a need in this film to place more emphasis on the personal side of andy kaufman s life with the woman he loved . more interaction with the cast of  taxi  was not shown and it should have been . writers scott alexander and larry karaszewski have written what looks more like a television script and you won t see director milos forman s stamp of sub text on any part of this movie . the movie also has serious problems with its continuity . a reference is made to jimmy carter as president of the united states and then it later shows kaufman on the first broadcast of saturday night live which 1975 . carter didn t take office as president until january 1977 so how could a reference be made to him as president in 1975 . also , a scene where kaufman and his lady go to the movies shows a poster of 1980 s  coal miner s daughter  and 1982 s  e . t . the extra terrestrial  side by side . the film is also technically flat . the climax of a christmas palladium act near the end of the film looks more like a college production than a professionally put together movie . as movie making ,  man on the moon  fails on almost every level and was a shocking disappointment from a two time oscar winning director like milos forman and as for oscar talk about jim carrey , this film looks like robin wiliams  first oscar nomination for  good morning vietnam  in 1987 . it s simply the comedian playing himself more and not enough of the character the script called for . what a let down !

negativeC,' capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith s films gets their own movie . the gags are sporadically funny . it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes . the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team . the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film . sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching . this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night . ( and it turns out he had very good reasons . ) rating : 4 ( 0 to 10 ) , low 0 ( -4 to + 4 ) a film needs a plot . it needs characters for empathy value . it needs a story and an emotional center . if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are . kevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy . with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp . peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled . but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith s fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it . his remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience . jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes . how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call . for me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny . there was not enough cleverness or variety . it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay . penis jokes work only so many times . showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags . they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico . jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners . as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts . in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads . jay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks . this leaves them at loose ends . they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie . they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash . so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way . the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny . silent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his . this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have . jay has to be the comic . he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive . the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny . he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair . so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team . their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before . like dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie . certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving . they are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat . it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content . the film does not offer much to an adult audience . i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

negativeC,' year : 1999 . starring patricia arquette , gabriel byrne , jonathan pryce , nia long , thomas kopache , rade serbedzija , enrico colantoni , dick latessa , portia de rossi . written by tom lazarus and rick ramage . directed by rupert wainwright . rated r . if anything , " stigmata " should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another . of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst . i suppose i should have seen this coming . after all , " blair witch " thoroughly creeped me out , " sixth sense " was mildly spooky , and then " stir of echoes " had its moments , but wasn t anything i d lose sleep over . clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping . is it then any surprise that " stigmata " is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? no , not really . patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother . as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest . the priest s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue . father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue . his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ . father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie  s story , considering she s an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on . he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church . as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a " fifth gospel " before they were excommunicated . the new rupert wainwright music video . . . i mean film " stigmata " is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse . indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it s only interesting for about five minutes . i m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school . his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing . what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , " see ? look at what i can do ! i m an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . " maybe then he d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) . if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn t see it . just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever . arrrrrrrghhhh . . . then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn t bother me if " stigmata " had a story or characters that were remotely engaging . though wainwright s vanity certainly doesn t help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script . where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren t given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her . the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she s kind of cute , so let s start the bleeding ! the fact that she s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn t help , either . according to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? go clubbing ! sure , that makes sense . arquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . even though frankie page s life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . even more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . father andrew s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . as for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , " i ll get you , my pretty , " for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . trust me , i m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . what s worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . first of all , the film doesn t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? how come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? actually , i m not sure what frankie was posessed by . supposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . which one is it ? the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . furthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . if you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . there s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . " stigmata s " religion is so off-base that it can t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . i m not catholic ; in fact , i don  t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . it s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as " stigmata " does . it  s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . i m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . maybe it s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . like so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . so much is overdone in " stigmata , " that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film s ( many ) flaws . i m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . when we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and " stigmata " is it .

negativeC,' director : tom shadyac cast : robin williams , monica potters , philip seymour hoffman , bob gunton , daniel london , peter coyote screenplay : steve oedekerk producers : mike farrell , barry kemp , marvin minoff , charles newirth runtime : 115 min . us distribution : universal rated pg-13 : strong language , crude humor copyright 1998 nathaniel r . atchesonthere is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries . i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories . i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac s shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey . the badness of patch adams is stupefying . it s confounding . i can t believe a film can be this bad . and yet , it s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn t want to kill himself . while there , he notices that the doctors don t care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it s good to help people . he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor . naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams . so patch decides that he s going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn t say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter s performance , even if she is wasted ) . but the film fails fundamentally in execution . every scene swells with grand , " emotional " music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard . take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . we don t know patch yet , but there s sad music , and it s supposed to make us really sad that he s sad . later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . real drama is character-based . you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . we don t ever grow to know the dying patient ; he s simply a vehicle for patch s greatness . real drama doesn t seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry . that s why patch adams is not real drama . it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene . even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman s sickening musical score . sentimentality like this is indeed bad . but it s not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes . you see , patch is a really great student . he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he s cheating . but patch doesn t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . " why don t we see patients until the third year ? " he bursts out every three seconds . well , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . most of us have to study . and a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn t know a toe from a finger , probably won t be too successful in preventing death . oh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to " prevent death , " but to " improve the quality of life ! " yes ! that is true ! and you can not do that without studying . you can not do that without going to medical school . what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . follow the rules ? bah ! who needs the rules ! only uptight doctors follow the rules . the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . and then there s the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . a free clinic . in the middle of the forest . where patients can be taken to be helped . for free . how will patients be transported to the free clinic ? will it have an emergency room ? or is it just for mental patients ? and who , may i ask , will pay for it ? the film does give some token attempts to question patch s motives ( i think another character asks him how he s going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don t explore or challenge patch s ideas to any meaningful extent . reader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . i know nothing about him . if his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . but regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . and in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . actually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . he shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . i won t tell you that you can t be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . patch adams is the cheapest of them all .

" bullets over broadway , " though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off . " mighty aphrodite " is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story . " everyone says i love you " was more of a great idea than a great film . even " deconstructing harry " is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films . if anything , the reception of " celebrity " by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it s not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it s him . " celebrity " is , yes , a good film , but it s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film . instead of creating the great woody allen world , he s created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about . and he s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections . it s like " la dolce vita " without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis . woody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead . much has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh s performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o  hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation . branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character s flaws to be more apparent . woody s a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he s really funny and really witty and really intelligent . branagh s allen is a bit more flat-out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we re still not sure if he s really a good person or not . his character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him . . . sorta . we then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion . he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie " but with a deep personal crisis " ) . as such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film . after griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is " polymorphously perverse " ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of " la dolce vita . " following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all . his story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status . while lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( " i ve become the kind of woman i ve always hated . . . and i m loving it . " ) without doing a thing . the result is a film of highs and mediums . the mediums are what take up most of the film , with sitations and scenes which don t exactly work but you can t help but pat allen on the back for trying . but other places are really great scenes . the opening . the sequence with theron , which is so good that i wished it hadn t ended . a banana scene with bebe neuwirth ( droll as ever ) . and , perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot-as-hell teen idol , brandon darrow , played by none other than leo dicaprio , who is so un-dicaprio-esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film , they d never look at him the same way . he ignites the screen with intensity , and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical , and totally heartbreaking for lee , who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read , and finds himself on a wild all-day ride with him . they go to atlantic city to watch a fight , they gamble , and they wind up in his hotel room , where darrow gets it on with his flame ( gretchen mol ) and he lends him one of the leftover groupies . allen s writing in these scenes are so good that just for them , i d almost recommend the film . almost . but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it s a mess , despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself , it s still a smart and insightful film . though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities , as it may seem to be ( if it were , it d be extremely out-of-touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity-hood with happiness . we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they re really happy ( they may appear to be on the surface . . . ) , but we do get close enough to lee and davis  character . lee is obsessed with the phenomenon , while davis takes is at arm s length , and never gets too involved in what it is , and soon becomes one herself . besides , it s witty , and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen s : that great woody allen feel . it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject , and yes , as a part of woody allen s oeuvre , it s merely a blip ( no " annie hall " but it s no " shadows and fog " either ) , but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him , and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor , like the one in the beginning , and make it work not once but twice .

negativeC,' fairy tale claims to be based in truth , from the writings of sir arthur conan doyle . however , the title and the special effects might lead you to believe this is a children s fantasy . unfortunately , this inspired attempt at a sweet story fails on both accounts . it s subject matter and dry storytelling are much to advanced for children , and is too dry for adults . the film focuses on a pair of little girls , cousins who roam the meadows looking for fairies . what sets them apart is from the adults in the film is that they believe in the existence of these little people , not only because they are girls at play , but because they have actually seen them . the adults don t develop faith until the girls take two photographs of fairies , at which point a controversy arises , do they exist , or was this an act of trickery ? the little girls and the fairies should be the focus of this film , but too much screen-time is devoted to harry houdini ( harvey keitel ) and sir arthur conan doyle ( peter o toole ) . because of the claimed truthfulness of the story , doyle and houdini are important to the story , but that doesn t mean they work . this film would have been much more entertaining both for children and for adults if they had taken the doyle storyline , and applied more of a fantastic twist . the true disappointment for me was that the fairies only appear onscreen briefly , and we never get to meet any of them . they look like wonderful characters , but none are ever explored , we don t know their names , we don t even get to hear them talk . there are some good aspects of the film , however . though much of the photography is standard and not terribly challenging , it manages to capture some beautiful scenery quite well . there are also some interesting looks at the early days of photography , showing us cameras from the early 20th century , and glass plate exposures . the little girls are quite good , especially frances ( elizabeth earl ) . she has a cute , smart and almost sassy attitude that translates quite well for her character . her energy is always high and she has some of the more enjoyable dialogue . unfortunately , type-casting does have its place in filmmaking , and even the most versatile of typecast actors have trouble now and again . physcially , there couldn t be a better match for harry houdini than harvey keitel , but when i watched him in this , i couldn t stop images of the pimp from taxi driver , or " the wolf " from pulp fiction from flooding my head . aside from the fact that houdini doesn t make much of an impact as a character in this film , keitel adds to the distraction . fairy tale a true story could have done a lot more . had it decided to take a turn into more fantasy , less realism , this could have been a real success . but the only time the children in the audience seemed excited , and asked questions of their parents as children so often do at the movies , was when the faires were onscreen . it seemed a shame that they were only able to enjoy the film for those fleeting moments . * * coincidentally , the two girls grew up to become old women , and confessed that the photographs were indeed fakes . so why couldn t this film have gone deeper into fantasy than it did if there was no truth to it . . . . . ?

[theater rating :  : very good sound , picture , and seats] the big-budget , mega-hype " event " movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one . gluttony is hollywood s favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis . " lost in space " is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre . it s made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for . audiences  attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has " star wars " written all over it ) , but as the producers  way of showing off their budget through the special effects . battle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it s impossible to care about anything that happens . in essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking . we meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth s behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources . each member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people . professor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it s obvious what role this aspect will play ) . of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are " resolved " at the right moments . the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it s presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it s laughable . the first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! ) . we re provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent . in fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent . yes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk . they say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it s the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) . it s amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens . eventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not . the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage . what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts . the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as " alien " -lite . the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive . but there s never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly . plotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario . the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it s presented in such a ridiculous way it s utterly boring . by the time the last act rolls around , there is no sense of a payoff building . the ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) . " lost in space " is major film production at its worst . it s frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment . please visit chad z movie page at : http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz - over 190 new and old films reviewed in depth , not just blind ratings and quick capsules .

negativeC,' stallone attempts to  act  in this cop drama . the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal , who s nephew ( played by michael rappaport ) is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths . keital dosen t really want to get involved in anything , gets rid of rappaport , and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on . this film should be brilliant . it sounds like a great plot , the actors are first grade , and the supporting cast is good aswell , and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance . however , it can t hold up . although the acting is fantastic ( even stallone isn t bad ) the directing and story is dull and long winded some scenes go on for too long , with nothing really happening in them . in fact , the only scenes that do work are action scenes , which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid . in this film , serious means dull . the dialogue is warbling , and basically just repeats the same points over and over , no matter who is delivering them . the plot , which has potential , is wasted , again just being cliched after a while . in fact , the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro , both delivering their usual good performances . however , stallone , although not given much to say , gives a good performance . however , it s not all that bad . as said above , the action scenes are well done . theres also a very good ending , which uses the cinemas sound system well . in fact , the last 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997 . if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending . cop land , then , turns out not to be a power house film , but a rather dull , and not every exciting film . hugely disappointing , and i can t really recommend it .

negativeC,' rated : r for strong violence , language , drug use , nudity , and some sexuality . starring : wesley snipes , anne archer , michael chaykin , donald sutherland , marie matiko . i ve never fully understood wesley snipes s career . he has his ups and downs , but mostly the downs . his best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled " blade " . he has had his typical action movies , " boiling point " , " passenger 57 " , but his new movie " the art of war " should just be called " rising sun 2 : the art of war " cause basically it s a semi-remake of the same plot , with a different cast , and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller , that is high on style and low on substance . wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u . n . after a chinese ambassador is killed , he is on the track of the killer , trying to find out who it is , how it happened , where the killer was , and what to do . anne archer plays his " boss " type person of the u . n . and she has hired snipes to track down the killer . well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer , and is now an outlaw , kidnapping a chinese woman with him , and having her help him along the way . all this leads to a finale that is so dumb , and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb , and the stunts , dialogue and acting all ruin this movie . wesley snipes isn t one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before . the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998 s " blade " . i walked into " the art of war " expecting a good , high octane thriller , and all i got was a pile of mush . the only real  good  thing the movie has is action , and plenty of it , but i noticed it is badly filmed , the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on . the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful , that it even tries to mock " the matrix " , laughably funny , it is undeniably stupid . christian duguay s direction is also not that great . his camera angles and sense of style are all in place , but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done . even the whole " matrix " ending wasn t even good . the stunts and action are badly filmed , and badly choreographed . his placing of the characters , and the assination of the chinese ambassador , and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable , that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie . anne archer who is usually good in her roles , turns in a horrible job here . she is sour , downbeat , and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue , and dumb moves . even donald sutherland as a co-star can t save this movie from being a bust . so for an overall opinion : " the art of war " is a total waste of time . it s not entertaining , nor exciting , or even action packed . it is a pointless movie , and makes absolutely no sense at all . if you really want to see a good version of " the art of war " , rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind " rising sun " , it isn t a great film either , but at least it s better than this .

negativeC,' some houses should never be visited . and some movies should never be remade . the haunting represents both of those tenets . a loose remake of the 1963 haunting , this version gives us a creepy haunted house and four hapless people to populate it . chief among them is eleanor ( taylor ) , a real wacko who believes there are children s spirits in the house that speak to her . and she s right ! wow , original ! and hey kids , the sexy zeta-jones plays a * bisexual * in the movie ! oooooh , scandalous ! ( sarcasm , people . ) so how does jan de bont , made famous as director of speed but best-known as the director of speed 2 : cruise control , get to make a horror film ? he was probably the only sucker in hollywood desperate enough to take a dog of a film like this . the fact that he s never done a horror flick just compounds the problems . as a result , the haunting is not scary -- at all . instead it s just a conglomeration of cheap fright tactics and a booming bass track meant to get you to jump out of your seat . which doesn t work . the haunting also features such a dumb story line and such bad dialogue it s almost pathetic . for a horror film to be frequently * boring * is unforgivable . and i wager that anyone who bothers to spend money on this lemon won t be able to forgive themselves either . a really cool set ( that ultimately serves no purpose ) is the only shining spot in the film . otherwise , feel free to skip this one .

negativeC,' writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) starring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso i suppose i m not extremely surprised that " virus " comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it s an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron s early works . in fact , " virus " is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the " aliens " vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . no such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron s wing for years and years , i m beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . in fact , " virus " should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like " virus " is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . the film seems to not only borrow it s plot from last year s similarly-fated " deep rising , " but also from a clunkish b-movie from the  80s called " leviathan , " an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part " alien , " part john carpenter s twisted remake of " the thing . " " virus , " again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . they get on . they break up into pairs and investigate . and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . and it s not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even " aliens " played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don t give a damn . i almost don t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he s a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . like anthony hopkins for " legends of the fall " ( the line " scrooooooo  em " has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . or peter o toole in " caligula . " great actor , horrific performance . it happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland s career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it s laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . " virus " mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , " if it s dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . " and if you don t believe me , go back and rent " godzilla , " and tell me if there s even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don t really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . but all of this doesn t matter since " virus " is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i ve ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn t figure it out when i saw it ) . imagine the first attack of the aliens in " aliens , " shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that s basically the whole of " virus " : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . and my god , it s a long damn sit . with no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it s a wonder that it even got made . we already know that big movie studios  mentality is shallow at best , and movies like " out of sight " and " saving private ryan " give you more faith in them , but movies like " virus " manage to drain a little more out of the pool . i almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . they read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . in fact , shouts of " egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? " are not only justifiable , but encouraged . '
negativeC,' it seems that david lynch s adaptation of frank herbert s epic science fiction novel dune ( 1984 ) wasn t enough to convince people that this classic works far better on the page . at least that box office fiasco packs in some interesting lynchian perversions . besides , how can you go wrong with a cast that includes patrick stewart , max von sydow , and alicia witt as a bald , pint-sized , knife-wielding child ? let me tell you something , buddy -- you can t top that ! maybe it ain t herbert s vision of dune , but it s fun at parties . so someone in the sci-fi channel marketing department thought that they d be able to create the definitive version of the novel , making much ballyhoo over it in the press . " this is the way frank herbert intended it ! " yes , yes , i m sure he was precisely thinking of static , made-for-television sets lifted from star trek : the next generation , bathed in nauseating greens , oranges , and fire engine reds . instead of lynchian puppets and latex gore , we re treated to phony bluescreens , computer generated b-movie effects , and a series of unrealistic matte paintings ( at least , they looked like matte paintings -- the press kit says they filmed in prague and tunisia ! ) and what s up with those gauche costumes , a cross between japanese kimonos and ronald mcdonald . something is clearly wrong here . an attempt to summarize herbert s richly layered plot would prove confounding , what with his fastidious attention to detail . we ll stick with the cliff s notes version : spice is the key to time travel , so ruthless barons and emperors across the galaxy negotiate to get their greedy stinking hands on as much of it as possible . he who controls the spice controls the universe . with his eye on the prize , stalwart duke leto atreities ( william hurt , given top billing but whacked pretty quick ) picks up stakes from his homeland and moves to the desert planet known as dune . comfortably settled into his new digs , he proceeds to mine for the spice and teach his brash young son paul ( alec newman ) about the birds and the bees . bizarre omens forebode that duke leto will be slain , and that young paul will be groomed as the prophesied messiah to lead the fremen ( rogue desert warriors ) to salvation and freedom ? slobbering baron vladimir harkonnen ( ian mcneice ) , sleek emperor shaddam iv ( giancarlo giannini , hannibal ) and other diabolical forces work intricate plots against the good guys . a traitor , an assassination attempt , and an ambush all figure into play before paul and his pouting cosmopolitan mother ( saskia reeves ) are cast out into the wild . will paul be groomed by the fremen tribes to fight in a ritualized kung-fu fight with feyd-rautha harkonnen ( matt keeslar , the last days of disco ) ? he damned well better , lads , because this is a six-hour epic ! all of the shoddy production elements would be forgiven if there was a halfway decent cast holding this house of cards together . hurt wanders through early scenes mumbling his lines , coasting on what i hope was a fat paycheck . he at least exudes regal presence , whereas newman s paul atreities ( played with authority by kyle maclachlan in lynch s version ) is less a boy prince than a refugee from a boy band . the women are a gaggle of weak-willed geese , with julie cox especially bratty as the emperor s daughter . her " flirting " scenes with paul will not only disgust fans of herbert s book ( for which their relationship is purely a matter of social convenience and political tact ) , but will also turn off anyone who happened to be taking this malarkey seriously . when did the sci-fi space opera turn into teen beat ? i hate to keep returning to the lynch version , but it was really so much better . even if you didn t catch all the new language or rituals originated by frank herbert ( for he is the kwizatz haderach ! ) , you accepted it as dream logic . better to be entertained and confused than casually dismissive , which is as much as this new dune deserves .

positiveC,' lancelot du lac ( lancelot du lac ) ( france , 1974 ) a film review by james kendrick director : robert bresson screenwriter : robert bresson ( based on the epic poem by chretien de troyes ) stars : luc simon ( lancelot ) , laura duke condominas ( queen guinevere ) , vladimir antolek-oresek ( king arthur ) , humbert balsan ( gawain ) , patrick bernhard ( modred ) , arthur de montalembert ( lionel ) mpaa rating : not rate review : ench director robert bresson s " lancelot of the lake " achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory s " morte darthur . " instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them . chivalry has no place in " lancelot of the lake , " except as that of a dying ideal . bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin s command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ s blood . bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure . the opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house . since the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn t carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films . we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness . but , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film . rather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom . lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh . the greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur s wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot . even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment . he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion . when sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot s defense . it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire . bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men s hearts and minds . " lancelot of the lake " is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music . he uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits . the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film s thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest . like most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices . all the actors he used in " lancelot of the lake " had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again . never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word . instead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images . in some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn t . the final montage of arthur s men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment . however , other times bresson s uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable . for instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses  legs . he does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag . while there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome . nevertheless , " lancelot of the lake " is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker . bresson s style may not be for everyone , but one has to respect his strength as an artist . by re-evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own , he turns " lancelot of the lake " into something rare in modern cinema : a truly personal film .

positiveC,' director : brian de palma writer : david koepp ( based on the novels " carlito s way " and " after hours " by edwin torres ) starring : al pacino , sean penn , penelope ann miller , john leguiziamo , luis guzman , john rebhorn , viggio mortensen , jorge porcel what s shocking about " carlito s way " is how good it is . having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino s previous film , " scent of a woman , " and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , " carlito s way " was destined for underrated heaven . that s what it is : an underrated gem of a movie . and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study . " carlito s way " deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality . of course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he s really a crook at heart . carlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can t escape into something he is not . carlito s attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn . when he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive . he s constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he s doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking . carlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that s where it s at ) , but needs some funding . being a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k . c . and the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite ) . he gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he s constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco " from the bronx " ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito . on the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison . she s a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami . while this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) . all of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable . when i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it . sure , it s going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate . what s amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills . like " apollo 13 , " we know what s going to happen , but we re still thrilled by what happens in the middle . it s also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller . de palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films . his earlier flim , " scarface " ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i m still not over ) . but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes . to me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet . this is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history . with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito s head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino s face , it s a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you . . . ) . the acting from all is great , especially from the three leads . pacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn t puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn t as " strong " as his oscar-winning role in " scent of a woman . " well , his " scent of a woman " performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a " foghorn leghorn impression . " in " carlito s way , " he s emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he s remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change . i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing , insult-throwing blind guy in " scent of a woman . " as i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry . and they re scenes are well-written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship . and sean penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat attorney . every scene he s in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino . in smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great . " carlito s way " is one of those films which you heard about briefly , but when you finally watch it , you re absolutely blown away . it s a wonderful film , a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn t do so hot . but trust me and check it out . it s a great little film , and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right .

" ) , and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another , they re all quite engaging . even the movie s more " serious " moments are played with a wink . heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the " believability " of " six days , seven nights "   heterosexual pairing . ( so she s a lesbian . so what . deal with it . ) of course it doesn t , and here , her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way . in fact , her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click ; these opposites attract with the utmost , endearing electricity . at one point , when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest , heche asks ford how old he is . after several wrong guesses ( " forty-five ? _fifty_ ? " ) , he whispers his age to her . " you still look good , " heche stammers . " i still _am_ good , " ford replies . she s good too , and together , they make " six days , seven nights " one memorable ride . © 1998 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the new and improved reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/ " suggestions , please , for the fourth movie in the series . how about  look who s talking back ,   in which the audience gets its turn ?

( perhaps the biggest kick i got out of a film with such a sweet religious bent was that it was playing two doors down from the exorcist . ) the director also works in an editorial of his own , commenting on the politics of such a place , where a person of free will may join for the love of god , but is given commands by a higher ranking human . visually , there is a strong connection through disney s lens between the cell of a monastery and a prison cell . but for all the heavy commentary , it s surprising how light and easy blessed art thou feels . depending upon your point-of-view , that could be a strength or a weakness , but at a minimum , i expected a bit more punch at the finish . the film doesn t necessarily demand your 90 minutes in a theater , but , for a thoughtful , eyebrow-raising story , it works . you may now return to associating the disney name with plush toys .

positiveC,' i seem to be in a minority of one , but chris tucker s outrageous mannerisms are beginning to grow on me . when he appeared in the fifth element as an over-the-top radio dj , my senses misfired : my brain wasn t properly able to compute what i was seeing until i relaxed and had a good time . the same thing applies to rush hour , a sprightly cop-buddy movie that works by being cheerful and engaging instead of cruel and mean-spirited . don t expect it to be an immortal piece of cinema , and you ll be fine . it is also the best of the jackie chan vehicles to be produced in english so far -- it outstrips mr . nice guy by a fair margin , since that movie was little more than a weak clothesline for various action pieces . rush hour is funner and more sustained , and puts chan up against someone who is a terrific foil . the plot is standard-issue . a chinese diplomat s daughter is kidnapped by a gang of criminals . the diplomat wants to enlist the help of lee , an old cop friend of his from pre-1998 hong kong days . the fbi refuses to allow this , so they have the lapd send over one of their own to " distract " him . carter ( tucker ) catches on fast to the sleazy runaround he s been given , and tells lee off : he doesn t want to babysit a cop ; he wants to go out there and find these slimeballs . funny thing is , lee feels the same way , and before you know it , they re up to their elbows in suspects and explosives . all of this is , of course , sustained and interleaved with tucker s wild-man motormouthing ( which gets funnier and funnier the more you watch it ) and jackie s typically remarkable stuntwork . what makes all of this stand out is primarily the tone and attitude . most movies in this genre tend to be cold-blooded and unpleasant ; this one s very much a romp , with good timing and pacing , and a lot of good laughs . i m betting jackie himself is the main reason for that , since he s professed repeatedly that he wants to make more family-oriented movies rather than john woo-style blast-fests . barely anyone gets shot , and most of the martial-arts stunts are about timing , object juggling , or three stooges-style slapstick . ( there is one stunt involving an antique vase that s vintage jackie -- although the way the stunt climaxes is a bit of a cheat . ) there is also the byplay between chan and tucker , much of which seems improvised ( or at least minimally scripted ) . at one point during a stakeout , edwin starr s " war " comes on the radio , and jackie attempts to sing along -- only to have tucker coach him on how to sing with soul . in turn , jackie teaches tucker how to do the snatch-the-other-guy s-gun trick ( and the payoff for that gag is a howl ) . my main criterion for a comedy is simple : did i laugh ? i walked into rush hour in a terrible mood , and laughed all the way through . i don t think you can reasonably expect much more than that .

positiveC,' starring antonio banderas and sir anthony hopkins . directed by martin campbell . running time : 2 hours 15 minutes swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults . steven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie . and he knows a money making winner when he sees one . the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action , funny comedy , and the pacing of a rollercoaster . hopkins plays don diego de la vega , otherwise known as zorro . a fighter for the people , he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson ) , who also , unintentionally , kills his wife . the film cuts to twenty years later , where vega still wants to montero dead . however , he s far too old now , and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro . banderas motive ? to avenge the death of his brother , who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar , in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie . with the scene set , the movie goes on full blast , with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners . banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro s , playing each other off with ease . hopkins seems to come off a little better , but banderas does some excellent work . as the bad guys , wilson and letscher seem one dimensional , but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way . the audience does hate them , which can t be bad . catherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter , and although she provides little more than the usual female lead , she delivers a charming , but one note , performance . the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones . there s a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together . the director , fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly . the action is well done and fast paced , the comedy put across well . the cast help a lot , but the direction is still outstanding . although the film is very long , the plot keeps chugging along , and there s barely a dull moment . however , the film is a little over indulgent , and it could have been trimmed . it manages to hold the attention , thankfully , and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel . screenwriters john eskow , ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script . although they ve bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action , the plot itself is barely existent . there s lots of little sub plots hanging around , but there s nothing substantial to bring them all together . the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to  buy  california using gold stolen from the guy he s buying the land off . this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines . however , this doesn t seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film , so the film is never quite sure where it s going . in the end however , zorro provides action and comedy in spades . it suitable for everyone , so put the guilt behind , and put some more money into spielbergs bank account . you won t regret it .

positiveC,' in _daylight_ , sylvester stallone breaks no new ground , cinematically speaking , but he covers familiar territory quite well . yesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it . i had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out . it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering . so , i shrugged , thought , " hey , they probably won t give me the card anyway , and i could always use a free movie , " so i signed up . all in all , i don t think i got that bad of a deal , either . rob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _dragon : the bruce lee story_ and , more recently , _dragonheart_ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ? you think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after-effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey . sylvester stallone plays kit latura , who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _cliffhanger_ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed . when the crisis hits , he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out . there are other similarities to _cliffhanger_ , too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _cliffhanger_ had a villain , where _daylight_ s bad guy is mother nature . in fact , had the two movies been made in hong kong , this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film " sequels " do to their predecessors . the first half-hour of _daylight_ is setup . subplots are woven , and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled . we meet all the important people . . . toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young , frustrated , jilted , rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others . we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons . and then , thirty minutes into the film , _boom_ . and it s a big one . from there on in , it s sly stallone to the rescue . and rescue he does , enduring batterings , beatings , falls , repeated immersion in 34-degree water , explosions , mud , rats , and constant setbacks , before going on to save the day , sly-style . again . . . there s nothing new here . and yet there doesn t need to be . the fun of _daylight_ is not in the story but in the execution . the special-effects are first-rate , thanks to industrial light and magic , and the ensemble cast works well together . once the film hits its stride , it carries the viewer right along to the finish , with very few jars along the way . this review is copyright 1996 by christopher e . meadows . permission granted for distribution through rec . arts . movies . reviews and all associated archival . permission granted for free redistribution via cyberspace as long as this message remains attached . all other rights reserved to the author . -- chris meadows aka | author , team m . e . c . h . a . , crapshoot & co . robotech@jurai . net | with a world wide web homepage located at robotech@eyrie . org | http : //www . jurai . net/~robotech/index . html '
positiveC,' capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp . to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity . the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone s taste . rating : 9 ( 0 to 10 ) , + 3 ( -4 to + 4 ) more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way . this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law . during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war . this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal . when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal . minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output . while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27% . the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad . that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do . the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day . and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll . in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany . filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese . there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps . certainly there was david lean s the bridge on the river kwai . there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it . then there were tv series " a town like alice " and " tenko . " lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa . it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university . the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them . the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad . it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves . beating and torture are commonplace events . men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable . however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house . so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine . this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies . the japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group s norms is all that gives a life meaning . conformity is purpose . before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp . if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story . if the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story . it is neither . it is a stirring and believable account of camp life . the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow . this serves a double purpose for cunningham . it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat . it also creates a distancing effect . the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music . this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience . i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a + 3 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

positiveC,' starring : anthony hopkins , alec baldwin , harold perrineau , elle macphersoni swear i have seen the edge before . in fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . however , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . in doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker . unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . one surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . even horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . the intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . the edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . i must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . this is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes  intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . the edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . but taking scream s lead , the edge makes fun of the genre s cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . charles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . for once , we don t immediately care for the main character . instead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles  wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . charles  birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . as action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . soon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his " personality . " charles , bob , bob s assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . down the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . take , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot . this has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears . but given the charles  intelligence , and bob s uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists . even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . my favorite line of the film comes from charles : " most people die in the wilderness because they didn t do the one thing that could save their life . . . thinking . " despite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn t as it seems anymore . i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . the first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles  survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice . tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility . i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . thankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . but some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal . anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences  sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . baldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way . you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer . elle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight . she isn t in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model . harold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed . he is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . the edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language . some of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me . this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down . director tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts . david mamet s script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid . the best thing about the script is the ending which doesn t end with the normal high-strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift . it s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear . and by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear . way to go , bart . reviewed by respect ( respect@aros . net ) http : //www . aros . net/~respect/movies . html '
positiveC,'  truman ( " true-man " ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey s character in this film . president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature . " truman " also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans . and burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc . if hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv s world , the world where our protagonist lives . combine all these names and concepts into " truman burbank , " and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world . truman leads the perfect life . his town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect . his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky . the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart . . . but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? the next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements . he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian . when the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully . his suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities . the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator . the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks . a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place . two security guards grab him and throw him out . truman is really suspicious now . it gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge . " it s best not to think about it , " she says , trying vainly to change truman s memory . truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense . at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town . his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world . you know by now that truman s life is the subject of a television program . his actions are " real " but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife . truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is . meanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman s world does his best to keep him unaware and happy . it s sort of like westworld told from the robots  point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs  point of view . we root for the captive of the cage-world . our protagonist is counting on " chaos theory " to help him escape his elaborate trap . the story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake . although these questions came to mind , i don t think the film itself asked them . it certainly didn t address them or try to answer them . i was particularly disappointed that the film didn t deal more with the trauma of learning one s life is a tv show . carrey s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman s pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film s pacing . earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . the two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn t see it that way . perhaps it s not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn t , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . but on its own terms , the movie is well made . sight , sound and pacing are all handled competently . much of the first part of the movie is the truman show . the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen . one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen . the music is well-chosen and scored . the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman s world is still beautiful and perfect . when the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre . philip glass  epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman s scenes of suspicion and awakening . ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) and the pacing of the story was brisk . there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman s idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn t necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . there s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . it s a quick , straight shot to the movie s end . in terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol s gattaca . both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film " clicked " and became an instant classic . nevertheless , i look forward to niccol s next film , whatever it may be . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes/ '
positiveC,' the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment s notice . the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . it takes a pretty smart person to do that . but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? what if he s also able to think on his feet ? in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray s the negotiator . in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman s home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain s office . i don t quite remember if the captain actually said , " i hate to do this , but . . . " , although it wouldn t surprise me if he did . luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . although roman s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . how can we believe he s going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it s would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson s acting ability . almost every time he s in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . his is an interesting character . made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . " i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , " he says . when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . gray really lucked out with this cast . david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . in l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . fortunately , this doesn t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . j . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . for one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . in the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it s reality . we re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . as an audience , we re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we d like to see if one will dominate the film . both provide some pretty good entertainment . '
positiveC,' conflict is overrated . too many screenwriters who have based their work on the numerous books that teach you how to write a screenplay step by step feel the need to inject conflict at every possible moment . at first sight is a good example of this . there are so many things about this film that work so well , but at times the forced conflict is so embarrasingly mindless it made me cringe . at first sight is based on a story by oliver sacks about restored sight . in the film , val kilmer plays virgil adamson , a man who has been blind since he was 3 . he works as a masseuse at a vacation resort . this is where he bumps into architect amy benic ( sorvino ) . these early scenes between them are nothing short of fantastic . kilmer and sorvino have a dynamic chemistry , and the film could ve simply focused on their romance the entire running time and be successful . but i know that s not the only story irwin winkler wants to tell . this film is also about how a blind man copes with restored sight . there is nothing wrong with this , considering the early scenes here are also quite effective . bruce davison is a doctor who performs a surgery to help virgil restore his sight . virgil s first moments of sight are very frightening , since has has no idea what exactly he is looking at . the moments of this story i enjoyed most dealt with virgil attempting to make sense of what he is seeing . for example , he knows what an apple looks like , but he can t tell the difference between a real apple and a picture of an apple . virgil is aided by visual therapist phil webster ( nathan lane ) . lane s performance is very good , but i wish there was more of his character here . i would ve preferred more scenes of human interaction and therapy between virgil and phil than dull lectures from bruce davison s character . but that s only a minor problem . the film s two biggest flaws are the introduction of two minor characters that didn t need to be in this story . steven webber plays sorvino s ex-husband and boss . first of all , it s hard to beleive these two were ever married , and it s even harder to beleive that their breakup wouldve been amicable enough for her to still want to work for him . but conflict is necessary says these screenwriting books , and the screenplay makes the major mistake of presenting webber s character as a threat to virgil and amy s romance . this guy is the most pathetic and pointless character since john pankow in the object of my affection . any scene he is in shakes the credibility of the entire film . another misconceived character comes in the form of virgil s father . he left virgil many years ago when he couldn t find a cure for his blindness . when he learns of virgil s restored sight , he tries to arrange a meeting between them . i don t care about this . the father is a throwaway character who we only see in two scenes , but the film asks us to find the scene between them touching and sad . it s just a mindless way to inject more conflict for virgil than was necessary . instead , why couldn t the film give a better subplot for virgil s sister ( very well played by kelly mcgillis ) ? . she has seemingly devoted her entire life to taking care of virgil , so why not show scenes where she wonders about her future without virgil ? now that he s with amy , she no longer has anyone to come home to and take care of . scenes like this would ve been more touching than a lame father- son reunion . the film does hint at this once , but it s quickly abandoned . yet once again this year , i enjoyed a film despite the appearance of several major flaws . if the allure of the friday night lights propelled varsity blues past it s flaws , then what works here is the powerful romance between virgil and amy . mira sorvino is a terrific actress , and this performance is among her best . she has a natural ability to show how much she cares for someone without even having to say a word . val kilmer abandons his usual brooding , egotistical style of performance and instead creates a character that he actually seems to care about . virgil is sweet , funny , smart , and even infuriating . kilmer is able to bring out all these traits perfectly , which is certainly more impressive than the simple technical task of looking like a blind person . together , they have immense chemistry and are able to carry the entire film past even it s most gaping of flaws .

[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] war is a topic that can t help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . it s easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number . " saving private ryan " is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . it proves there s a huge difference between battling and killing . the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . it s world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . " poor " is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . we don t get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they re there . in the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn t happen . the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they re shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . the film seems to rely on the audience s sense of patriotism , that the american military is " right " and good and that the nazis are " inherently evil . " the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn t help but feel some sense of joy and relief . to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there s nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . tom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . he s never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . he doesn t want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . the mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general s attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each s death simultaneously . when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . it s easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . but finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , " like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . " the saving of private ryan isn t just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . when miller s company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn t so quick to shrug it off . he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone s sense of hope a reality . the mission to find ryan gives miller s group a destination , but not direction . along the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . a few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . the act of killing itself becomes one of the film s major philosophical metaphors . the soldiers don t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . unfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn t want us to think these men are invincible . in fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work . although the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time . whether they re arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable . sure , there s a zinger here and there , but war doesn t change the fact boys will be boys . if and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them . the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence . private ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ? that s not a premise for thrills , it s symbolic of everything the film has worked for . it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends the way it must end . i remember reading a " calvin & hobbes " comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like , " dad , how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ? " " saving private ryan " is the adult version of that question . please visit chad z movie page at : http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz - over 200 new and old films reviewed in depth , not just blind ratings and quick capsules .

positiveC,' disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched . to see a disaster film with actual originality , or at least a decent plot twist , would definitely be a welcome surprise . unfortunately , folks , it s not likely . dante s peak is cliched , and at times corny , but also pretty decent . to be honest , i wasn t very interested in seeing this film , and word of mouth , as well as several reviews , didn t make it sound promising . so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn t bad at all . it s pretty run of the mill , but it s not something i would say is merely " ok " to watch . in case you don t know , dante s peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it s shadow , dante s peak ( who would ve guessed , eh ? ) . pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and , perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof , is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future . due to the lack of more substantial evidence , nobody warns the small town , and when they finally do , it s in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows . brosnan , all around good guy , will , of course , save the day . . . or at least the mayor of dante s peak ( linda hamilton ) . naturally the two will become infatuated with one another . ( if you think i just ruined a plot development , you haven t seen very many movies ! ) there s also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings . and of course , the kids or the dog ( at least one or the other ) will do something heroic . . . but hey , i don t want to ruin all the surprises ! if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante s peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time , i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself . it s not brain food , but it succeeds at what it s meant to be . . . an enjoyable , suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash !

it s about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages . the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure  there is no real beginning or end . instead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans . they represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships  male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin . we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled . there is comedy and tragedy . most importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives  in this fiction can be found much truth . the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year . it s so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over . the onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance . it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured . there are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest s focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship . the first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson ) . these two have a stormy relationship . they love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other . much of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other . frances  adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father . on this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks . although their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction . once they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things don t go exactly as planned . lily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees . death is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area . it doesn t matter whether or not they knew the deceased . it s the ceremony that they re interested in . sam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water . unlike lily and chloe , these two have their entire lives ahead of them . they are young enough to still believe in magic , but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience . the acting is strong and believable . the mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective , with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles . there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non-related actors . and , of course , the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child . the winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 , with rickman as the director . four of the film s principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film . unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up . the rough , bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans . in fact , considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman s microscope , it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie . if you appreciate character studies , the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater .

" the big lebowski " deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that " fargo " did ; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film , " lebowski " is at least as breathtakingly imaginative . the movie boasts a mile-high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over , but thankfully never does . the coens ( joel directed , ethan produced and both wrote ) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale , and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick . whether we re watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence , " the big lebowski " is immensely lively . there are those who will dislike this film , but not because it s boring . the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they re given . bridges exudes a likeable , surprisingly sweet presence ; his dude sure isn t the cleanest guy around , but you d still follow him to another movie . goodman merits 1998 s first oscar consideration , as walter s manic temper is one of " the big lebowski "  s many highlights ; the same goes for moore , whose throaty , delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot . john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction . sam elliott s rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start . and some will recognize peter stormare -- " fargo "  s silent heavy -- as carl hungus , a porn star who s really a samurai sword-wielding german nihilist and has-been pop star . only in its final third does the movie falter , with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call . these flaws are forgivable , though -- the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it s hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face . without a doubt , " the big lebowski " is the best film so far this year . sure , we re only three months in and the competition ( " deep rising , " " desperate measures , " " the wedding singer , " etc . ) has been pretty bland , but it s still the gospel truth . maybe during next awards season , " lebowski " won t be a far cry from " fargo .

positiveC,' scream 2  directed by wes craven . written by kevin williamson . starring neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette . only a year after the initial release of " scream , " the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel " scream 2 " has arrived in our theaters . while the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . the first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . the premise of " scream 2 " is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called " stab , " based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in " scream , " is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . its conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it s a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . the satire in " scream 2 " thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general . although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . everything from " friends " and " saved by the bell " to " showgirls " and " terminator 2 " is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren t any " wes carpenter " jokes this time . more importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from " scream " ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . understandably , " scream 2 " does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted . couple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right . we don t just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner . while i have not seen any of his other work , it s easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated " slasher film " director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . unfortunately , " scream 2 " occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window . for example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . as for the question of whether or not " scream 2 " is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . . . well , it s hard to say . i gave the first " scream " 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up . " scream 2 " bounces all over the place stylistically , but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . i m not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily suck .

positiveC,'  directed by mimi leder starring george clooney , nicole kidman , armin-mueller stahl , michael lures , randall batinkoff , michael boatman mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er . her mast famous episode , " love s labour lost " , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child . the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing . there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood s big blockbuster movies . so it s only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster . and i have to say , after a shaky beginning , she does not disappoint . peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new . the first half hour goes into detail , way too much detail , about how the weapons are stolen . despite a few good images , including a train collision and a very impressive explosion , none of this was very coherent . it s long and drawn out , and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better . once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture , it begins to take off . george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world . he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters . nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling . there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two , but that is dispensed with quickly . the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe , trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them . clooney goes through bouts of sarcasm , frustration , determination , and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt . this is when leder starts to show her true stuff . she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer . then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter . then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york city s crowded streets , and a madman with a nuke walking among them . mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense . she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking . nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero . you re not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her . george clooney is a real movie star . many of you may have hated him as batman , but this guy is for real . he has a natural screen presence , and an ingratiating personality . he ll be around for a while . dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker .

positiveC,' release date : january 22 , 1999 starring : emily watson , rachel griffiths , david morrissey , james frain , charles dance , celia imrie directed by : anand tucker distributed by : october films mpaa rating : r ( language , sexuality ) url : http : //www . execpc . com/~kinnopio/reviews/1999/hilary . htm not since 1996 s shine , which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott , has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class musicians . in fact , if one were to watch these films together , it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills . yet hilary and jackie , the sophomore effort from director anand tucker , has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale . emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale , playing the sisters du pré . both musicians from childhood , hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello . the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women , both together and seperate . their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another s , and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love . the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance . they contrast each other wonderfully , and while watson s portrayal of jackie du pré is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic , both characters are charged with emotion . the frank cottrell boyce script , which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pré , brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well . the script is also to be commended for its well-polished dual nature . cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller ( which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne s script for mission : impossible ) and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame . the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least , and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story . some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised . nevertheless , hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around .

positiveC,' director : brad silberling || screenplay : dana stevens ( based on an original screenplay by wim wenders and peter handke ) || stars : nicolas cage ( seth ) , meg ryan ( maggie ) , andré braugher ( cassiel ) , dennis franz ( messinger ) , colm feore ( jordan ) , robin bartlett ( anne ) , joanna merlin ( teresa ) || mpaa rating : pg-13 there is a striking scene early in " city of angels , " where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . the camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . then the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . you see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . it is an important scene for several reasons . first of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . the film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . there are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like " angels in the outfield " ( 1994 ) or " michael " ( 1996 ) . the angels here are stark and believable . this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . they eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . like human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . " city of angels " is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . he first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . maggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it s not enough . he wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to " fall " and become human . he learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( " n . y . p . d . blue " ) in a touching and humorous performance . sitting at a diner together , franz tells cage s character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person s skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . of course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . " city of angels " is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender s haunting 1988 film " wings of desire . " wenders  film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . and , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn t suffer extensive damage . this may be because director brad silberling ( " casper " ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( " blink " ) wanted to make " city of angels " its own movie - inspired by " wings of desire , " but not an attempt to copy it . and yet , " city of angels " is not a typical hollywood movie . it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( " the english patient " ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . seale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . while the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . both cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . ryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . what is most striking about " city of angels " is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . it s not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . it doesn t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . instead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . ____________________________________________ visit " charlie don t surf !

positiveC,' by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don t understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film . zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he d like to think so ) . however , he s a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are . zero s accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a " normal " guy who does the business side of the job -- he s the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero s greatness as an investigator . the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero s talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o neal ) . it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about . zero takes the case , and the plot thickens . his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) . despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark . through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him . i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film . i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown s greatness ) . zero effect , which is jake kasdan s first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it s an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture . with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them . but he didn t just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment . take , for starters , the great cast of characters . pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven t seen from him since spaceballs . zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he s an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . pullman s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he s going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . " i ll shoot you , " he says to stark at one point . " i have a gun , and everything . " his character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . o neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . kasdan s humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . it s the kind of humor that s funny even after you ve seen it five or six times . there s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . i can t convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . as a side note , i don t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . i have a feeling the humor here won t appeal to everyone , but there s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone s interest . jake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . i found this out after seeing the film , and i can t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . his direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . zero effect is the kind of film that i ll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . at the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . and , with kasdan s undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future .

positiveC,' in zoolander , the world s most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , " is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? " obviously , the film s creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? no , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more . much like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie . it s not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek s model roommates all die in a tragic " gasoline fight " accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) . but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused . better yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag . zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs . fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed . enter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight . on the trail of mugatu s plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller s real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she s hoping to use mugatu s pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme . much like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today . wilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel . ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers . jerry stiller -- ben s dad who s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek s slimy agent maury ballstein . even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse . as for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he s stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners . unfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here . maybe it s just because i can t stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn t had sex in two years . she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role . while zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days . zoolander s no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction .

positiveC,' bob the happy bastard s quickie review : what s worse than y2k ? how about a fully digital future where nothing is real ? that s what computer programmer neo ( keanu reeves ) slowly learns as he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix , a movie directed by the wachowski brothers ( the guys behind the hip thriller bound ) . before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role , hold on . there s actually a story with depth here . it seems that a group of hackers is out to stop the system that is the matrix , led by the bald but brilliant laurence fishburne and assisted by carrie ann moss , who looks quite cool in leather , i must say . neo ( reeves ) is pretty much a key player in this fight , although he really doesn t look it at first . could this amateur be " the one " as fisburne thinks he is ? credit the wachowskis for putting together a great story that allows suspense to build , something that few special effects-laden films seem to do these days . there s plenty of effects to go around , of course , but at least there s a backbone to build them on as well . reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo , particularly in a fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy , yet great . i wish the villains weren t quite so " generic " ( leftover g-men from looking for a sweet sci-fi actioner with plenty of stop-motion swooping camera angles and , of course , a motherlode of a helicopter explosion . now the wachowskis are headed into horror films with their next project . bring it on .

positiveC,' the ability to suspend ones disbelief is a vital trait when attending a schwarzengger movie . however , due to the absence of a good film from the big austrian for quite some time , people seem to have forgotten this . the biggest complaint i hear about " end of days " is that it was unbelievable . i m sorry , but i personally believe it is incredibly naive to expect arnold to appear in a realistic film . twenty years ago , a newborn girl was chosen by a satanic cult to be the one who would bear the child of satan . now , young christine ( robin tunney ) is grown up and is being stalked by three different groups : two church factions , one intent on killing her ; and the other , led by father kovak ( rod steiger ) , attempting to protect and hide her ; the third party is satan himself , possessing the body of a wall street banker ( gabriel byrne ) . drawn into the conflict are jericho cane ( arnold schwarzenegger ) and chicago ( kevin pollak ) , two bodyguards hired by the man they do not know to be satan . as cane is drawn deeper and deeper into the conflict , he learns that christine must not be impregnated or the world will come to an end . if you don t like arnold movies , chances are you already know to steer clear of this one . if this somehow hasn t occured to you , let me reassure you that this is a schwarzenegger film in the truest sense , so stay far away . being a typical film of the schwarzenegger genre , this movie is a whole lot of fun , but be sure to leave your brain and sense of logic at the door . there are more plot holes here than i can begin to count . this movie isn t about plot though . it s about fight scenes , explosions and special effects . these are certainly present in abundance . on the down side , the acting here is certainly less than phenomenal from the leads . as all know , arnold isn t going to get any oscar nominations in the near future . however , he is charismatic enough to get away with this . robin tunney , on the other hand , is likely to get nominated for at least one award , and that s the razzie . not only is she laughably bad in this role , but she looks utterly dumbfounded as to what she s supposed to be doing half the time . as for the rest of the cast , rod steiger is as good as ever ; kevin pollak is certainly in his element as a smart alec of a side-kick ; and cch pounder , a remarkable actress , is woefully underused as a police detective . the real standout performance here comes from gabriel byrne as the man ( this is how he s credited ) himself . byrne simply oozes charm and authority . watch for a scene in which he meets a skateboarder who disrespects him . " end of days " is mindless movie fun nearly at its best . it doesn t quite make it because the film does border on being too mindless at times . some of the scenes we are expected to swallow will have you gawking at the screen in disbelief ( such as how cane discovers the existence of christine ) . if you think you can get past this , just sit back , relax , and enjoy . " end of days " runs a touch too long at 120 minutes . i give it three and a half stars , and a recommendation to catch a matinee . feel free to e-mail with comments at : jabii@aol . com * * * * * - one of the greatest movies ever made , see it now . * * * * - great flick . try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie , hits and misses . * * - pretty bad . see it if you ve got nothing better to do . * - one of the worst movies ever . see it only if you enjoy pain .

positiveC,' jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance . for the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film . daryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes . the parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine ) . he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes . however zero s observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society . he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr . watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller ) . arlo is not happy with his job . he is thrilled to be around zero s brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer . and they re even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend s boss means more to arlo than her . this is the situation when a new case comes knocking . gregory stark ( ryan o neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys . it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence . now , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end . to solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell . however , this is when he is vulnerable . . . and this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme . for the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic . zero effect is weakest in its obviously " wacky " scenes depicting daryl zero s odd behavior . such scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character . however , there s a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out . that s not to say that there s not a place for humor in this film . in fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer . however , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren t funny enough to stand on their own . once the investigation is underway , however , zero s brilliance really begins to shine . his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock s own . as the mystery begins to unfold , zero s deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer . zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well . zero s relationship with gloria is low-key , but it hits all the right notes . however , we are always kept distant from gloria s character . she s given plenty of development , but we never understand what she is thinking . perhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero s zone of detachment . but , on the whole , it is frustrating . bill pullman , when he s not spacing out , creates a vibrant character in daryl zero . there s one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years , and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character , but one which fits in well . and , although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called " zero " seriously , it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name . although zero effect is a bit awkward in places , it is a strong debut for kasdan , and shows great promise .

positiveC,' bob the happy bastard s quickie review : brendan fraser s stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . . fraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) . it s a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in . but who cares , the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can t get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon . fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground . basically , it s a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress . his plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible . of course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising s kevin j . o connor ) and some " americans " . . . and guess what ? yup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc . fire flies from the sky , flesh-eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep s plan begins to unfold . ok , so it s not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough . the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz isn t half bad either . the action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well . no , it s no phantom menace beater , but if you re looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season , you won t find a better film under wraps than the mummy . if this doesn t give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will .

positiveC,' member of the  internet movie critics association  http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/studio/5713/index . html  lethal weapon 4  is the film mel gibson said he would never do . never say never . with a pay cheque of 20 million dollars and a guarantee of 20 per cent of the film s earnings , " never " is a word the isn t found in mel s vocabulary . this is a film made for one reason and one reason only : pure profit ! that is always the case with sequels but in the case of warner brothers , it is particularly a show of desperation since they have had a number of flops recently and need a hit badly . i don t have a problem with movie sequels because in many ways , they re equivalent to visiting an old friend as you come back for more and more fun each time .  lethal weapon 4  isn t a terrible movie , it s just one too many and the franchise is starting to show one thing : age ! mel gibson , danny glover , joe pesci and rene russo are all starting to show signs of aging . not too badly but in comparison to the other films : a lot . as  lethal weapon 4  opens , the streets of l . a . are once again endangered , this time by a psychotic , protected with body armor who fires automatic rounds and shots from a flame-thrower in any direction he pleases . riggs and murtaugh ( gibson and glover ) eventually put a stop to his antics with humourous results and the film move forward from there . the central plot of  lethal weapon 4  is an immigrant smuggling ring run by an old asian warlord whose right hand man ( jet li ) is a cool and frightening martial arts expert who silences his enemies by putting his moves on them . some of the immigrants brought to america are to work as slaves and murtaugh takes a family under his wing and has them live at home with his wife and children as a way of understanding how slavery affected his ancestors . all the while illegal but definitely the humane thing to do . riggs and his girlfriend lorna ( rene russo ) are expecting a baby any day now , as is murtaugh s daughter who is married to a cop ( chris rock ) , a man who works with riggs and murtaugh and a man murtaugh doesn t know is married to his daughter because she was afraid to tell him since he was always against her marrying a cop . murtaugh later finds out about his new son-in-law while getting high on some dentist s laughing gas and the humour is what has always saved these movies from falling into the abyss . this movie certainly stays within the tradition of slick action movies with the key emphasis being on the word " slick " . the slickest and best installment of all the  lethal weapon  movies is #2 which had the most bruising story and climax of all . it also introduced us to joe pesci as leo getz who became the comic relief of the series and although his character was badly used in #3 , he is better this time around . director richard donner keeps the movie alive with well photographed and edited scenes of action and ranks as one of the action genre s most talented contributors . i ll probably put  lethal weapon 4  in my video collection for the sake of uniting it with other members of its family but i ll probably watch it the least as it is the least of all the  lethal weapon  movies , without hesitation .

positiveC,' oliver stone s latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents . it s a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century . stone doesn t hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house . the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done . at the same time he creates a very human character , a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics , which is here pictured as a wild animal . he is simply trying to tame it . but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president s ability to control them . stone doesn t in any way apologize for nixon . he blames not only nixon s own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself , the system that , once set in motion , behaves with a mindlessness of its own . " nixon " is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws . there s something almost majestic about the process : as nixon goes down in this film , there is no gloating , but a watery sigh , as of a great ship sinking . sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding , creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president . joan allen s magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette . she is strong and loyal as mrs . nixon . the rest of the cast is equally magnificent , including : james woods , j . t . walsh , paul sorvino , ed harris and bob hoskins . everyone does a serious and demanding job , no one are disappointing . stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy , honest and determined . he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element . at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon s youth and childhood . the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin , robert richardson s rich cinematography and john williams  musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere . the film s only fault is that it s a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers . still it s an honest and captivating - a solid piece of movie making .

positiveC,' capsule : russ meyer s most popular movie hasn t dated badly , and it serves as the best introduction to the mammary-mad director . i wasn t too sure what to think when john waters raved in his memoirs that faster , pussycat ! was " the best film ever made " . chalk that up to waters  love of high-trash cinema , i guess . exactly how much credit , and for what , to give to meyer is a seriously debatable question . one thing i don t doubt was that he made a campy , magnetic , high-energy movie that hasn t dated all that badly -- much better than many of the other movies he made at the time . ( and because all the eroticism is implied , that makes it only smuttier and therefore more fascinating . ) faster , pussycat ! gives us three go-go dancers who head out into the desert to race their cars . ( i couldn t help thinking that meyer would have had endless fun with a scene where one of them explains her ambitions to eventually enter law school , making love to a support pillar during the whole conversation . ) after meeting up with a whitebread-innocent couple , varla ( tura satana ) gets fed up with being one-upped , and kills the guy with a few well-placed karate blows . they kidnap the girl and keep her sedated while trying to figure out what to do next -- although it sort of hits them over the head : at a gas station , they learn than a weird old cripple and his sons live in the area , harboring a massive fortune . no prizes for guessing what happens next . the movie s loaded with things that have since become pop-cinema staples : bizarre camera angles and editing , improbable character pairings , bizarre fights . one of the most memorable scenes has satana vs . one of the old man s sons . she s trying to run him into a wall with her speedster , and he s holding her car at bay with his bare hands , the wheels digging a huge ditch . satana s idea of karate has nothing on jackie chan , but it s not hard to see how a woman using violence against a man in the late sixties , on-screen , could be construed as * really * shocking . she isn t flashy ; she s trying to do damage . she means business . as the model ( or at least the center of inspiration ) for the rest of the women in the film , tura satana eats up the screen without even trying . she reminds me of the extremely fetishistic , almost representational ways women are depicted in x-rated japanese manga : gigantic chest , mask-like face , drill-instructor s voice . she reportedly received a deluge of fan mail after the movie came out , mostly from men who either wanted to marry her or be flogged by her . most of the reason you can t look away from the screen is her , and it s not because she s attractive , or even sexy . she s terrifying , especially when meyer shoves the camera down on the desert floor , somewhere between her toes , and has her stare down at us . what we wind up with , incredibly , is probably the wellspring of almost every butch-femme empowerment image . i m not sure madonna or pat califa would exist as we know them , without something like faster , pussycat ! as part of the ambient background noise in american culture . then again , maybe i m crediting him with too much . but then i watched ralph fiennes get the cheese kicked out of him by a green-haired punk girl in strange days , and thought : maybe too much credit isn t nearly enough ! -----== posted via deja news , the leader in internet discussion ==----- http : //www . dejanews . com/ now offering spam-free web-based newsreading '
positiveC,'  at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . that s true of home alone 2 and i d bet money that it s true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . but home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn t get in the way . the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids  cruelty . kevin s patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he s going to have to starve . he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back . the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . on his way up the stairs , he tells her that " families suck " and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him . it s interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . they re two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . meanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . he s finally rid of his family ! life is a dream come true . he can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother s secret box . slowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . he grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( " i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener " ) . he also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring . the furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house . macaulay culkin is cute but he isn t much of an actor . still , we can see that kevin s character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing . for example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as " santa " is getting in his car . kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . he learned how to deal with the furnace . you turn on the lights and it s not so scary anymore . he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man . they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . finally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) . this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie s genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert . it s a lot of fun , and it doesn t overwhelm the rest of the movie . on the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie . john williams  original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . but it does have its flaws . the smallest problem is that culkin doesn t act very well . as i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin s insight into his character . the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin s life about five times . instead of " i m gonna get that kid " they say " i m gonna kill that kid . " some might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree . mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . i ll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . don t let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes/ '

" mr . saturday night " is the biography of now-aged buddy and his brother stan , told in alternating flashbacks and flashforwards , with nearly equal time given to the present . the two yankelman boys are broad , in-house comics who keep their family in stitches . at their first public appearance on amateur nite ( sic ) , stan , 18 , gets cold feet , but remains in the wings , encouraging abie , 16 , who , at the last second , has taken on the name of buddy young , jr . nice , quiet , sensitive stan , stays on with the raucous buddy as the latter serves his apprenticeship and reaches specialized fame in the borscht belt s circuit , culminating at grossinger s in 1950 . while buddy convulses his audiences , stan , in the background , is a perfect definition of " factotum . " he is figaro to buddy s count almaviva , his manager , gofer , soundboard , as well as the butt of his brother s whims and ego . occasionally too becomes an unwilling , resentful pimp , as when he brings to buddy an admirer , elaine ( julie warner ) . stan is attracted to her but it is buddy who marries the charming young woman . buddy rises to becoming an increasingly important las vegas performer , though always billed below the headliners . in a clever bit , his appearance on the ed sullivan show is a catastrophe , since he follows the beatles before a frenzied , hysterical audience of youths . still , he does get tv celebrity as " mr . saturday night , " though never attaining superstardom . actors never stop acting in real life , but this isn t always evident . most comics are non-stop performers too , but the nature of their trade is such that their off-stage jokes are always obvious . buddy , if not the ultimate , is the archetypical new york jewish comedian , conceived , written and played with great inside-track knowledge and much affection , colossal warts and all . he is a monomaniacally compulsive jokester 24 hours a day , to the point that only one-liners and gags count for him . being so set in his tunnel-vision ways , he becomes self-destructive , flubs his chances , loses sponsors and exploits even those who love him ( brother , wife , daughter ) , through neglect and jokes at their expense . anything for a laugh , any time . buddy s compulsive , incessant joking does not spare events such as his wedding , the birth of his child , his being at his dying mother s side , even her funeral too . yet on those occasions the film manages sometimes to transcend the tacky and the crude , and can introduce bittersweet moments of true pathos . the movie is a two-hour homage to generations of ethnic jokemeisters and their shticks . it would take a computer to analyze all the ingredients , the name comics who enter this amalgam . yet , crystal s buddy is both a composite and a comic in his own right . but he is no human being by common norms . like many one-track-mind professionals , he is self-centered , has no personal dimensions , or , for that matter , a meaningful private life . in vague terms which place much of the onus on buddy , we learn that his daughter s life has been a failure . his wife , the lovely elaine , was introduced in 1950 as the perfect mate : witty , gutsy , lively with repartee . . . later though , when we meet her repeatedly , she has receded into the background . her personality has disappeared . whilst all those around buddy fade into stooges or supporting characters , the movie makes an exception by sketching with deft irony and much affection buddy s mother , thus salvaging some family values . mostly though , it shows with sharp realism the perpetual insecurity of showbiz people , even at the height of their reputation . above all , the movie works in , as its second major , as well as most original element , the buddy-stan relationship , ambiguous yet clear , built on narcissism and monstrous insensitivity on one side , antagonism , devotion and frustration on the other , and a weird kind of love under the surface . as stan , david paymer quietly steals every scene he appears in . when , " tired of shlepwork , " he retires , the film almost acquires a tragic tinge . it is an osca-caliber performance . billy crystal s supercharged acting is striking too , as a monochord , more obvious tour-de-force . the excellent playing extends to the supporting actors : young agent helen hunt who tries , against the comic s own self-defeating nature , to give the aged buddy a second chance ; jerry orbach as her boss ; or ron silver as a big-time film director who used to idolize buddy . the gallery of characters is also reinforced by the precise physical casting of two youngsters as the teen-age brothers , and by the make-up of stan as an old man . parchment-faced buddy however , in spite of the much-advertised , lengthy cosmetic sessions , made me uncomfortable . it felt as though the eyes were peering from behind a plastic mask the story s structure tends to be a bit systematically repetitious . it hammers its points , especially the swinging pendulum between rapport and alienation in the two brothers . in the last act you sense that the writers are desperately seeking a wrap-up . and since movies cannot let go of the odd notion that performers , whether young or old , deserve more pathos and sympathy than anyone else , " mr . saturday night " too oversentimentalizes the actors and the showbiz profession . as they should , the jokes run realistically from crude to indifferent , with occasional fresh gems . equally true-to-life is buddy s repertory , strong on insults but cautious on political issues . a hilarious , lightning-fast scene with bread rolls would have made charlie chaplin proud of crystal . but there is much more than rib-tickling to this suprisingly complex and ultimately affecting view of a lifetime in schlock .

positiveC,' after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy . this new film has been underrated for no reason . it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla s pervious films . it is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two . the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some " unfinished " developments of some characters . the film elegantly begins with nino rota s recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael s voice as he is writing a letter to his children : " the only wealth in this world is children . more than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure " . the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of " part ii " to make his father s dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate . michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling . constantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children . the family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church . later that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , " a check in the amount of $100 million . " but the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness . sure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin . but god does not take payoffs . the plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican . there is a moment in " godfather iii " where michael says : " all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal . but the higher i go , the crookier it becomes . . " . visually this film is as spectacular as the first two . gordon willis  rich cinematography , carmine copolla s beautiful composition and alex tavoularis  wonderful art direction could not be better . but copolla s first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection . the third installment has only the plot and visuals . some characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films . the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional . the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars . andy garcia is powerful as sonny s son , strong , focused and loyal . violence is natural to him . he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family s behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was . however both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless . and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed . the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends , that you remember from the first and second films . in the third film michael has become almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger . this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo s character was more developed . many have pointed out that making the third film , was unnecessary . i disagree . it is a beautiful film of great importance , completing the tragic saga of the corleone family . the first film showed some horrible results of corleone s life . it showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times . a man desperately trying to keep his balance , focus , family and sanity , while everything is crashing all around him . the third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael s life . the life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed . there is no turning back . and no matter how hard you try to get out of it , to free yourself , no matter how powerful and wealthy you are , you are helpless - sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely . the beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film , when michael is sitting alone in his chair , left by everyone , surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead . here he dies - alone , miserable and unforgiven '

positiveC,' directed by gregory hoblit . screenplay by tobias emmerich . starring dennis quaid , james caviezel , elizabeth mitchell . running time : 121 minutes . rated aa by the mfcb . reviewed on may 4th , 2000 . one of the big problems with many movies about changing history is that they tend to get bogged down in its mechanics . the difficulty is that our modern understanding of time is still incredibly limited , so any such discussion will by its very nature come across as a load of gobbledegook . good movies like " back to the future " ignore the subject altogether , or at most give it a passing acknowledgement . their makers are aware that the fun thing about time isn t how it works , but how it can be used in a dramatic context . " frequency " is such a film , and it proves to be one of the most entertaining movies of the year so far . john sullivan ( james caviezel ) is a cop in 1999 new york . he has just broken up with his girlfriend , drinks a little too much , and is all too aware that it s almost the thirtieth anniversary of the death of his father . frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) was a firefighter who perished in 1969 rescuing a transient from a warehouse fire . one night , john happens upon his dad s old ham radio , mothballed since frank s demise . for old times  sake , he switches it on . a lot of things were happening in new york around the time of frank s death . the " amazing " mets were on their way to winning the world series against the baltimore orioles . a serial killer murdered four nurses before vanishing without a trace . and the aurora borealis -- the northern lights -- was making a rare week-long appearance in the skies above the city . in 1999 , the northern lights have returned to new york for the first time in three decades . by some freak accident of nature , this allows john to speak to frank in 1969 via the ham radio . john manages to convince his father that he really is communicating from the future by predicting events of the mets/orioles world series , and gives him enough information about the warehouse fire to save his life . but this changes the whole pattern of history , and not all for the good . somehow , frank s survival has meant that the so-called nightingale killer s death toll was ten instead of four -- and one of the " new " victims was john s mother julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) . frank and john must cooperate across the years to stop the murderer in time . " frequency " is not a particularly deep movie . in a way it s about the relationship between fathers and sons , and how profoundly the absence of the former can affect the latter . and of course it deals with the familiar science-fiction notion of how changing one seemingly innocuous event can have major ramifications on things long after . but , in the end , the real point of " frequency " is just to tell a good story , and in this it excels . there are a lot of great scenes in which frank and john s altering of history is explored , not on a pseudoscientific level but on a purely visceral one . the movie doesn t try to justify its temporal mechanics ( indeed , there are some inconsistencies in how frank s actions ripple down to his son ) , but just taps into our sense of the fantastic . for example , at one point frank communicates with john by burning a message into his desk . john sees the letters appear one by one and touches them , expecting to find them hot . but of course they re not , because they were made thirty years earlier . later , frank acquires a wallet with the murderer s fingerprints on it , but can t go to the police in 1969 because they d never believe his story . so he hides the wallet beneath a loose floorboard , where john retrieves it in 1999 . " wow , " breathes frank , and he is speaking as much for the audience as for himself . while these sorts of things are nothing new to the genre , rarely have they been done so well and with such enthusiasm . and there are a couple of particularly imaginative sequences , especially a visually awesome one at the movie s climax . the only real downside to " frequency " is that the serial killer storyline which dominates its second half is rather pedestrian . this is not to say that it s badly done -- it s intriguing enough in its own way -- but it just doesn t live up to the wonder which permeates the rest of the movie . scenes like one where frank is arrested for being the nightingale killer seem commonplace , for instance , and the proceedings generally feel as though they ve been lifted out of an uncommonly bizarre episode of " law and order " . but even this is energised by excellent performances from caviezel and particularly quaid . " frequency " lives or dies on the conviction of their father/son relationship , made more challenging by the fact that their communications aren t face-to-face . but both actors are up to the task , bringing genuine emotion to the story . as a result , it s easy to suspend our disbelief and buy into the movie , and it s hard to suppress a cheer when frank survives the fire , or when father and son team up to stop the killer . director gregory hoblit does a good job , especially in keeping the frequent and potentially dull scenes of frank and john talking on the radio alive and interesting . also , he wisely chooses not to overplay the changes father and son have wrought on the present . although some differences are highlighted , many others are left as subtle background detail . like " back to the future " , this gives the film a richness it would otherwise be lacking . " frequency " has a broad appeal that s rare in movies today . it s a science-fiction movie where the characters come first , where visual effects take a backseat to story and acting , but which is exciting and suspenseful nonetheless .

positiveC,' © copyright 2001 planet sick-boy . all rights reserved . with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different . its structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . the parallels don t end there , either . atlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king s dreamcatcher . even the film s content is a bit reminiscent of mile . in fact , it s the perfect blend of the feel-good  60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . king s atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film s title comes from the second chapter ) . it s set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould s secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . bobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich . when a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby s mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . i won t go into what these powers are , but they re considerably toned down from the book ( and don t involve black stuff flying out of ted s mouth , a la mile ) . atlantis  present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel s final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks  cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski s red . the acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter . most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . while i didn t really have much of a problem with goldman s screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . goldman , for those of you who don t read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else s films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he s penned ( like the general s daughter ) . it s mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . j . and robert blake ) . in atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . well , he s not , and it doesn t make sense . 1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements '

" the supernatural thriller , written and directed by alejandro amenábar ( " open your eyes " ) , adroitly establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace . the cinematography , by javier aguirresarobe , is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances . but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied . overall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old " twilight zone " episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child s toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy . watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter , i always wanted to shout , " get on with it ! " as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in " the others , " my reaction was much the same . set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii , the story focuses on grace ( kidman ) , who tends to her children anne ( alakina mann ) and nicholas ( james bentley ) and worries about her husband , charles ( christopher eccleston ) , a missing serviceman . anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors , protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time . at the beginning of the film , three servants , mrs . mills ( fionnula flanagan ) , young , mute lydia ( elaine cassidy ) , and mr . tuttle ( eric sykes ) , an aging gardener , join the family . the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first , but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not . to make matters worse , the children are upset : nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts . grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home , only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them . that s essentially the whole story , with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear . earlier , there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside , only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog . the visuals in the otherworldly sequence , courtesy of aguirresarobe , are simply astounding . i also enjoyed the presence of religion , a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural . grace is a christian and answers her children s questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper . when mother is away , though , the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore , just as real children do . but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending . " the others " sets out to be a classic ghost story , but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist . '
positiveC,' my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance ( or a movie that we ve all seen a million times ) , two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins . this is exactly what happened in this movie , but fortunately , they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way . the movie starts with a quick ( and i do mean quick ) glance of two presidents russell kramer ( jack lemmon ) and matt douglas ( james garner ) . william haney ( dan aykroyd ) and ted matthews ( john heard ) are the new president and vice president . there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago . he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead . this movie was exceptional for many reasons . one being that they found people ( lemmon and garner ) that have good chemisty together . they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly , one being a ladies man and one being the old man ( i ll let you fiqure which is which ) . also , they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well . it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman ( except then he was a congressman ) . experience counts for a lot ! !

positiveC,' mute witness ( 1994 ) a film review by justin felix . copyright 1999 justin felix . any comments about this review ? contact me at justinfelix@yahoo . com all of my film reviews are archived at http : //us . imdb . com/m/reviews_by ? justin + felix written and directed by anthony waller . starring marina zudina . special cameo by alec guinness . rated r ( contains brutal violence , nudity , and profanity ) 90 mins . synopsis : an attractive mute makeup artist , working on an ultra-cheesy slasher movie in moscow , witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians . meanwhile , the artist s sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her . comments : mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it . drawn by the clever artwork on the video box , i rented the film expecting a complete turkey . mute witness , however , was original , offbeat , and well-made . it s one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about . i ve subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit , and it may be seen , on occasion , on the independent film channel . the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense , as billy , the quite believable mute heroine , sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film . the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy s vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures . to throw a curveball into the fray , billy s sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes . a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film . look for alec guinness ( obi-wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy ) in a small role as the evil reaper . definately check this movie out ; although , as a word of warning , it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly aren t for the squeamish .

positiveC,' the director of the crow ( 1994 ) returns with this happy epic , set in a world where the sun is always shining and everyone is cheerful . only kidding . as you could guess by the title , dark city is a dark , depressive , but somewhat entertaining picture . set sometime in the future , the film begins when we see john murdoch ( sewell ) wake up with no memory . he can t remember his wife emma ( connely ) or the murders that he has been framed for . and when he encounters strange , tall people wearing silly hats trying to kill him ( called  the strangers  ) , he tries to get answers . with the help of dr . scheriber ( sutherland ) he tries to work out what the hell is going on . hot on his tail on this time is world weary cop inspector frank bumstead ( hurt . ) despite the dark setting , and the depressive mood the picture has , dark city is entertaining . the first thing that makes the film fun is the cast . director alex proyas has managed to assemble a pretty good cast for what is essentially a very silly sci-fi movie . rufus sewell does a good job looking confused , and also does the action scenes all right aswell . sutherland appears to be having fun as the doctor , even if he is overacting just a little . his delivery of his lines really started to annoy me , though . ( he pauses every two words . ) more worringly , he s looking more like his father every day . connelly fine in her role , although it dosen t require much . her singing voice , by the way , is anita kelsey , so don t expect any connelly hits in the chart s any time soon . william hurt is not bad , even though he dosen t really appear to be trying . also popping up is ian richardson and richard o brian as two of the strangers . both are good english actors , and watching them dress up in the most stupid costumes , blurting out lines which a b movie screenwriter would be proud of is actually quite amusing ( if you re british , that is . ) then again , o brien dressed up stupid in the rocky horror picture show ( 1975 ) so looking silly is no stranger to him . like the crow , the film is directed like a music video with a large budget . proyas uses fast cuts , quick zooms and a dance soundtrack to great effect , as they manage ( along with the acting ) to drown out the poor dialogue ( written by lem dobbs , david s . goyer and proyas himself . ) the fast paced directing helps the movie bound along . the dialogue just slows it down . it s clumsy , stupid , and in the end , just boring . the best thing about dark city , however , is the look of the film . the city is impressive , it s look the place the crow ( and deckard from bladerunner , 1982 ) would live . the special effects are also impressive , especially the ones in the overblown finale . dark city is a definite case of style of content . if you get bored of the movie , just sit back and enjoy the great scenery , the great directing , and the soundtrack . this things alone probably make dark city worth watching . it may not be the best film of the year , but dark city is worth watching , and is ultimately just good fun .

positiveC,' as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you ve got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet . i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world s biggest paid commercial for america online . and i wonder : is that so bad ? well , the commercial part is . as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i ll be okay . to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act . they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks  glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he s suitably obnoxious . tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he s going to get the girl : the only question is how ? meg ryan , america s high school sweetheart , can act . she s had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don t , get the movie-- fantastic ) . but , i like her best when she s , well , perky . she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime . some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don t really know . all i know is that i just like them both . they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that s really hard to resist , and i m not going to even try . they re just really , really cute , sweet , and charming . hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle . here , the setup is a little different . kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children s bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her . she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) . she is also having an affair , of sorts . you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 . they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is . ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) . fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children s bookseller named " shop around the corner " , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly . every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight " to the death ! ! " . it s a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have . it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no " let s have sex tonight " mantra , if you ll excuse my bluntness . this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love . hmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan " hook up " , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness . you know it s going to happen , the question is now ? thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids . it s all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good . hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is . he is , i believe , america s greatest actor . does he show it here ? nah . but he s still tom hanks , and she s still meg ryan . which is what this movie boils down to . it s pure confection . all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it s all really sweet . there are some immense flaws , like pacing . the last third of the movie really doesn t work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it s slow . once hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow . i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour . the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated . e-mail ? when my kids are my age , i don t know what we ll be using . but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history . they just work together , and it s nice to see . it gives you , well , a smile . the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake . i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was . i ve always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed . you see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate . movies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i d rather not think about that . i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night . and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had . hanks was the driving force behind one of the year s best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world . he s also half of the glue behind the year s best example of pure entertainment . tom hanks and meg ryan are magical , as is this movie . it s a sweet , lovely affair with a technology twist . it may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face .

positiveC,' apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) . director ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . jim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . if they ever reach it . ed harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . also , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner . watch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . a bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . those who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate  might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . this is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . you should enjoy it .

positiveC,' capsule : the funniest horror movie ever made ; a melange of dario argento and wile e . coyote . evil dead 2 : dead by dawn is the result of an unstable fusion of warner bros . cartoon slapstick and _giallo_ horror-movie conventions . it s a flick with the mind of a splatter film and the heart of a mack sennett two-reeler . in plain , non-fanboy language , it s a ton of disgusting fun . example : a monster of the undead rises from the cellar , only to have its head smashed in the trapdoor . its eyeball pops out and flies into the mouth of one of the three screaming girls in the movie . gulp . the plot , what there is of it , is simple to the point of irrelevancy . a young man and his girlfriend head out to an abandoned cabin for a romantic interlude , and unwittingly unleash the evil undead . the girl dies horribly and the man ( square-jawed bruce campbell ) lives -- but as what ? horrendous mutations strike him like epileptic fits . the dead rise out of their graves and inflict ghastly punishments and tortures on him . his own hand rebels against him ( and the punishment he exacts on it is howlingly painful ) . the majority of the movie is one long , roaring blast of slime , guts , special effects and ear-drilling sound effects , but it s put together in a way that gets more than a fair amount of good laughs . evil dead 2 is most likely * the * item that started the whole trend of sly , self-referential horror movies ( culminating , of course , in the brilliantly nasty scream ) , although it s a lot more freakish and far-out .

positiveC,' starring : arthur hill ( dr . jeremy stone ) , david wayne ( dr . charles dutton ) , james olson ( dr . mark hall ) , kate reid ( dr . ruth leavitt ) . produced and directed by robert wise . the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made . i know that is very sweeping statement , so i ll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of " science fiction , " stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot . 2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . most all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting . the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town . something bad happens to them . pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight . apparently everyone in the town is dead . the authorities call a " wildfire alert , " summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super-secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada . two of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins . some went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive . they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a " directive 712 , " an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb . what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth-like life and mutates as it grows . their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict . what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a-bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet . they barely call off the bombing in time . but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out . this triggers the lab s last-ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb . to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow . much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts . but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw . the performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low-key and restrained , just like scientists . to me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting . we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don t expect . this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it . it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body s wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood .

positiveC,' lili taylor nabbed one of her first lead roles in this true life drama about valerie jean solanas , the woman who shot andy warhol in 1968 . but the film is more of a showcase to the ways of the 60s and the influence that warhol and other artists had on the people at that time . valerie jean solanas ( taylor ) is a lesbian feminist who as written a book called scum manifesto , a book ( which is now a classic ) about the way that men ( like disease , or so she says ) have been ruling here for the millions of years before us . she tries to sell it on the street , and is thrilled when her drag queen friend is invited to andy warhol s pad . this is her chance to sell him not only on the book , but on some plays that she has been writing . but andy is just like all of the other men out there . when a publisher signs her to a fraud contract and a friend puts her on a television show discussing homosexuality where the host makes fun of her , she begins to think that andy is all behind it . he s been constantly ignoring and making fun of her and she doesn t like it . her increasing rage is about to bring on the deadliest of consequences . lili taylor gives the performance of her career ( at least so far ) she puts every ounce that she can into this character and it s a great treat to watch . flaws are abound however , most of the film is boring and needs something interesting to be put on the screen and the story was told harsher than it needs to be . still , the film does a good job of examining the inner rage that overcame the woman and her actions thereafter . if your looking for a cool 60s noir piece , rent i shot andy warhol , which gets * * * stars . the young-uns : the main character is lesbian and we see one lesbian encounter . she is also a prostitute and we see two ( not very explicit ) sex scenes of her servicing her customers . it also contains strong language and drug use . good age : 16 & up a review by frankie paiva the 12 year-old movie reviewer e-mail me at swpstke@aol . com visit my website at : http : //expage . com/page/teenagemoviecritic '
positiveC,' i love japanese anime on the big screen . the gorgeous colors , the daunting cel animation detailing the smallest blades of grass , the complex storylines and character designs , and the thundering soundtrack . and the impending release of vampire hunter d : bloodlust has made me wet with anticipation . the original vampire hunter d was produced for video only in 1985 . its twisted violence , a plot thick with deception and honor , perverted sex scenes , and beautiful acts of heads and limbs being lopped off are a d&d geek s wet dream . based upon volume three of hideyuki kikuchi s vampire hunter d novel series , bloodlust follows the continuing story of d and his travels as a vampire hunter for hire . in the distant future , vampires rule with an iron first over fiefdoms of human-occupied lands with their minions of mutants and werewolves . as the years have passed , though , the vampire rulers have gradually lost their power and are now being hunted by bounty hunters . one of the most famous hunters is a mysterious outcast named d , a " dunpeal " ( born of a vampire father and a human mother ) , who s equipped with a super-quick sword , a black cape blowing in the wind , and a penchant for ass kicking . d s latest job involves a simple rescue operation to reclaim an affluent family s lovely daughter charlotte from the clutches of meier link , an ultra-smooth vampire with a silly eurotrash accent . but competition waits in the form of the markus brothers -- a randy bunch of mercenaries who use knives , strength , crossbows , and even a guy s ghost to capture their vampire booty . along the way , the undead rise from their graves , werewolves howl at the moon , and creeping evil in the shadows crosses their paths at every turn . vampire hunter d : bloodlust is a qualified success in the animation department , combining fantasy with reality through the solid efforts of asian production house madhouse studios ( also responsible for co-creating the awesome hbo spawn animated series ) . but there s a strong western influence in both set design and landscapes throughout the picture . as well , director yoshiaki kawajiri ( wicked city ) handles the action well and delivers a number of memorable moments that even rival anime classics like battle angel . on the flip side , the main problems with the film are that its plot is weak and the characters fail to evolve . bloodlust never sells the conviction of evil within any of the main characters , instead relying on the age-old romanticism of the vampire . eventually it degenerates into a standard love story/rescue mission . worse still , d s character is so utterly invincible there s never a sense that the story could go any other way than that he will save the girl and beat the evil bad guys . the film s humor , mainly projected by d s talking left hand , feels forced and unsure . vampire hunter d : bloodlust earns enough points in the animation department to carry the innocuous plot . it s almost enough to make you forgive the lousy title .

positiveC,' as fairy tales go , cinderella has to be one of the most famous . almost everyone knows it , well at least in north america . so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it . it has been done before with varying results . this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time . the basic story remains unchanged but , one thing that seems to vanish with this version , and that is all the fantastical elements of the story . there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature . after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least . . unlike in the fairy tale , the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end . the prince  , who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france , meets  cinderella  , known as danielle , on a few occasions , most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her . although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling . . the story takes place in a renaissance setting ; in france , with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion . this addition of leonardo da vinci , was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie , since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical . for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired . for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle , a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that . especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne . the characters of danielle ( cinderella ) played by drew barrymore , and that of the evil step mother , played by anjelica huston , are well developed and well played by the two women . although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable . the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie . as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique . but , anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly . the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella , but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable . the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise . all in all this movie takes you back into history , into a seemingly magical fairy land . but , don t get me wrong there is nothing but reality , it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening . so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not , and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing '
positiveC,' congratulations to kate winslet for defying the odds , by choosing to play the lead role in the small , but beautiful hideous kinky as a follow-up to her oscar nominated turn in titanic , the highest grossing and most expensive film of all time . but was this really such a surprise ? not at all , once you look at the wide range of films that the british actress appeared in before titanic . she showed incredible talent at a young age in such films as jude , heavenly creatures and sense and sensibility ( for which she recieved her first oscar nomination ) . her latest , hideous kinky , is an exotic odyssey that is much more than a star vehicle . hideous kinky is not a plot driven movie , but it tells the tale of a hippie named julia ( kate winslet ) who has brought her two young girls ( bella riza and carrie mullan ) to morocco to find peace , love , and faith in the early 70 s . while in london , the children s father thrives as a poet , julia has no money . it is then that she meets bilal ( said taghmaoui ) , a moroccan ex-con who is hiding from his past . he wins the affection of julia and her children and he becomes like a father to them . bilal seems to be a nice man , but he often vanishes at times when he is needed . for all the wonder of hideous kinky , the real pleasure comes from watching the two little girls onscreen . they both run around screaming wild phrases like " hideous kinky ! " and each character is a presence on her own . it is rare for children to dominate a film , especially when matched up against kate winslet , who gives one of her better performances . hideous kinky reminded me a little of this year s a walk on the moon , because both are similar tales of a woman trying to find herself during the same time period . hideous kinky s wondrous soundtrack combines moroccan music with 60 s hits , and john de borman s luscious cinematography makes the film what it is . director gillies mackinnon ( regeneration , a simple twist of fate ) has crafted a spritual gem , scripted by brother billy . mackinnon lets kate winslet show depth unseen in titanic , and he shows a talent for working with young actors . as for the film s title ; it s a bit misleading , and i still haven t figured out what it means . but hideous kinky is an independent film that takes us to places we ve never been . a review by akiva gottlieb , the teenage movie critic akiva@excite . com http : //www . angelfire . com/mo/film watch me on tbs  " dinner and a movie " may 21 , 8 : 05pm est get your free , private email at http : //mail . excite . com/ '
positiveC,' men have feelings too . men cry , despite the stigma attached to their gender , or at least they want to more than they let on . it s all societal conditioning . that s the pretentious premise of this never-ending , two-hour look at couple dysfunction . with a highly acclaimed cast that includes anthony lapaglia , barbara hershey , and geoffrey rush you would hope this idea would provide great material for such illustrious actors to sink their teeth into . unfortunately , having been adapted for the screen from a play , by the playwright himself , much of the emotional impact is lost in overwhelmingly dramatic dialogue . valerie ( hershey ) , married to john ( rush ) , is a therapist , and her patients  lives are starting to intrude on her own mental state . her daughter was horribly murdered two years before and her marriage has been stagnant ever since . she and john love each other but cannot connect . one of valerie s patients , patrick , is a homosexual who continually talks of an affair with a married man . slowly , valerie becomes convinced that the divide between she and john is larger than she thought , possibly as a result of patrick . then there s leon ( lapaglia ) a cop married to the beautiful and vibrant sonja ( kerry armstrong ) , who is secretly going to valerie for therapy . leon is having an affair with jane ( rachael blake ) , though he is still in love with his wife , as an attempt to feel something . jane herself is consistently lonely after separating from her husband and often spies on the family next door . these circles become claustrophobic because valerie suddenly disappears one evening . leon is put on the case as a detective and breaks off his affair with jane , but still can t get his life in order . these factors combine to create many a scene in which men are trying to express emotions and mistakes to one another , and fail miserably . to give the film some credit , it is able to portray masculine anxiety in reacting to a situation too much like a stereotypical woman would . the real problem is that during sympathetic moments , emotive speeches seem forced on all the characters that are uttering them . while the acting is basically impeccable , the conversations are unreal and difficult to accept , even at their most dramatic climaxes . it doesn t help that , when these men are trying to talk to one another , there is repetitive whining about how men aren t suppose to cry or show emotion . still , what keeps things interesting is that every person involved is heavily flawed . they lie and cheat and find it difficult to learn from their mistakes . there s always hope , in a new scene filled with tension , that some kind of new barrier will be breached , that some catharsis will come through . the plot is hazy enough , as are its characters , that any growth or change is unpredictable . to see the little details that spring from the characters  effects on each other rings true enough . what also works are the dysfunctional marriage scenes between husband and wife . communication comes through looks and stares instead of accusatory speeches . the annoying chatter present when it s two movie-character men talking is thankfully left out . lantana s strengths and weaknesses , like its characters , balance each other out . not a flaw can be found in how it articulates difficulty within a marriage . if only it would stop complaining about how men are raised .

positiveC,' based on the laura zigman novel , animal husbandry , someone like you is a romantic comedy about a late night tv talent coordinator named jane ( ashley judd ) , whose luck in love is predictably bad . so predictable is her misfortune , in fact , that she has devised a pervasive theory on the subject , revolving around the notion that men are like cattle . when she meets her show s new executive , ray ( kinnear , you ve got mail ) , however , her luck -- she thinks -- begins to change . but ray , she discovers , is just a typical bull , looking to spread his seed in wider pastures . and it s not until he dumps her for his ex-girlfriend that she realizes the true depth of her plight . jane , it seems , is an old cow . and ray is looking for a new cow . this joke more or less carries the film , and -- though interesting at first -- it gets old after its twentieth or fiftieth appearance in the script . fortunately , though , the film s fresh , funny dialogue packs enough power to keep things interesting . and the wry , cynical performance of hugh jackman ( x-men ) as the incorrigibly good-timing eddie drops in just in time to prevent the entire film from degenerating into a ridiculously softball piece of fluff . these combine with quick , quirky editing to provide enough stimuli to keep most audiences alert for this sub two-hour picture . those needing a little more stimulation than that ( men , mostly ) should take heart in the fact that ashley s underpants scene from the movie s trailer is served justly on the big screen . ( though anyone looking for world-class cheerleading sequences will be saddened to learn that judd s jumping splits performance was ruined by her inability to keep both legs straight in midair . for the record , this didn t bother me a bit . ) judd carries her role with a meg ryan-esque charm that should prove valuable in future productions , while jackman proves he has all the qualities of a rugged , enviable leading man . the supporting cast is funny , and well placed , as well -- particularly ellen barkin as the host of the late night show . much to my surprise , someone like you made for a funny , enjoyable picture right up until its final moments , when it completely brained itself by falling into the usual rut of romantic comedy conclusions . with its richness of dialogue and editing , i was certain it might have overcome its genre to set some new precedent in romantic comedy cheese . but no . in the end , this is still a warm , fuzzy picture with enough wit to satisfy most audiences in need of a laugh . ladies : go for the humor . gents : stay for the underpants .

positiveC,' i didn t read mitch albom s book , tuesdays with morrie , which spent about two jillion years on the bestseller lists . but based on the movie , i can see why so many people bought the book and why it s ripe for criticism . as brandeis university professor morrie schwartz s body deteriorated from lou gehrig s disease , former student albom decided to record the man s thoughts on an array of topics . if the movie is anything like the book , then morrie sounds like the world s foremost pop psychologist . and that s part of the problem i had watching the adaptation . albom claims that morrie was " a force " in the classroom , but he gets stuck saying things like " once you learn how to die , you learn how to live . " albom is certainly a happier person for having talked to his teacher , but i get the feeling he could have rented old yeller or watched a few self-help infomercials and came out ok . sarcastic comments aside , i can t fault a made-for-tv movie that has sturdy , sensitive performances and good intentions . if i can be taught about the values of life and not want to smack any of the characters upside the head , then the movie can t be all that bad . hank azaria ( the birdcage ) plays albom , a work-obsessed detroit sportswriter who is constantly on the go . his world stops when he sees a news special profiling morrie s condition . some 15 years after promising to keep in touch and not doing so , albom decides to visit his professor . pretty soon , they regularly meet on tuesdays--morrie s old office hours . jack lemmon plays morrie , a man whose indomitable spirit is still whole regardless of the medical obstacles he faces . it s a role that could have been played like a geriatric patch adams , but lemmon ( one of the best actors of his generation ) handles the role with grace . azaria , always an undervalued actor , does a good job and even sounds a bit like albom , a regular on espn . azaria has always had a slightly cynical streak to him that makes him more human . that trait serves him especially well in this occasionally sudsy , but overall entertaining fare .

positiveC,' the thin red line ( m ) . ( twentieth century fox ) director : terrence malick stars : sean penn , nick nolte , jim caviezel , john cusack , elias koteas , woody harrelson , ben chaplin , jared leton , adrien brody , george clooney , john c reilly , john travolta , john savage , arie verveen , dash mihok running time : 171 minutes . writer/director terrence malick can hardly be called prolific . he made only two films ( the critically acclaimed badlands and days of heaven ) in the mid- 70 s , before taking a self imposed twenty year hiatus from hollywood . his first film in two decades is one of the most eagerly anticipated cinema events this side of the new star wars film . while it is certainly visually impressive , malick s the thin red line is something of a disappointment , especially when compared with spielberg s achievement in the recent devastating and unforgettable saving private ryan . based on the novel by james jones , the thin red line deals with us forces fighting the japanese army at guadalcanal , a bitter and costly campaign that became one of the turning points of w . w . ii . however , malick s epic war film is a different animal to spielberg s . unlike spielberg , malick doesn t immediately hurtle us into the inferno of battle . instead , he lulls us into the brutality of war through an extended prologue . witt ( jim caviezel ) , an awol soldier , lives in short-lived tranquillity in a peaceful native village somewhere in the pacific . he becomes part of the massive us landing force at guadalcanal . the film s centrepiece is the extended and savage campaign to destroy japanese machine gun fortifications and take a crucial hill . this often graphic and quite harrowing battle occupies over half of the film s three hour running time . however , the action lacks the intensity and ferocity of spielberg s recreation of the fury of warfare . it also seems to lack that gritty air of authenticity that seemed to effectively suck audiences into the maelstrom . the combat scenes give the audience the extremes of heroism . but malick is also concerned with showing the madness of battle fatigue , and the film depicts the senseless loss of life and futile carnage of the war . the thin red line is almost a profound and almost poetic meditation on the nature of war and how it poisons man s soul . there s nothing noble about this bloody conflict , and , ultimately , there are no winners . the film was shot on location , partly in tropical far north queensland as well as in the solomon islands . such is malick s reputation that he had a veritable who s who of hollywood queuing up for small roles , including john travolta , john cusack , woody harrelson , george clooney , and sean penn . unfortunately , though , few of the characters leave a lasting impact on the audience , and i found that i didn t really care about them or their fate . nick nolte is dynamic as the obsessed and driven colonel who relishes his first opportunity to fight a war after fifteen years in the army , and who doesn t care how many men have to lose their lives in securing a vital strategic position . caviezel brings a human face to the film as witt , the reluctant soldier who ultimately becomes a hero when tested in battle . the thin red line is certainly malick s most epic and ambitious film to date , and it is as meticulously crafted and evocative as his previous work . he gives this war film an almost elegiac quality and a rare humanity . his sweeping vision is complemented by the spectacularly gorgeous cinematography of dual oscar winner john toll and the haunting score from hans zimmer .

" see spot run " has a mother going out of town , leaving her son with an idiot neighbor . body function humor abounds , including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop . what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film . the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process . at the hospital , the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn t bit off the other one , because two metal replacement balls would clack together . of course , the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells . somebody clue me in  when did genital mutilation become funny ?

" the storyline is silly and convoluted , but even at its most dense , it is easier to follow than either " mission : impossible " movie . director robert rodriguez ( " from dusk to dawn " ) maintains a frenetic pace , with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes . a bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice , but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family . alexa vega and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother and sister team , squabbling the way kids do , but coming together when it counts . antonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents ; they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes . even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments  a virtual cloud-backed chat between his character and juni is one of the best segments in the film . had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that , i would have enjoyed the film more ( and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mc-ubiquitous company ) . regardless , " spy kids " is a hoot , offering fun for adults and children alike . and just think , they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle .

positiveC,'  i ve never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski . the part of jeff " the dude " lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect . the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians . he s enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes . after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug . the dude assumes that these " collection agents " were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug . the millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped . he wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers . dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers . comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny . it is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films . not only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure . all the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived . each person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension . the characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh . it s not what they do that s funny , it s who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie . worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that s jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who s in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as " vaginal ; " steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator . aside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue . people lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends . . . they sound natural . taken with fargo , the coen brothers  last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers . ethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he s also good at technical directing . he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film . perhaps " beautiful " is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty . but the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film . all around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy . outstanding acting , writing , direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes/ '

" the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . there are so many impressive sequences that i d find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al  s toy barn , the store owned by woody s captor . pixar s rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . " toy story 2 " is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn t yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . it may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it s downright touching . the script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it s a sequel . the reason " toy story 2 " works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original s success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters . not this one . we get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . " toy story 2 " is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . the humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . there are funny asides to films such as " star wars " and " jurassic park , " among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock  em sock  em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts " a bug s life " and the 1997 short " geri  s game . " ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody s broken arm . ) the action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . " toy story 2 " never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest . the more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . it s rare to see a film like " toy story 2 " come along , because it s the kind of film that s almost impossible to dislike . it s created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . it s a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing " toy story 2 . " it s the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original . '

well , if you mean you want the truth about what the new x-files movie is titled , i can t really help you . the movie titles only said the x-files . the advertisements all seem to say the x-files : fight the future . well , take it either way . i think it s just the x-files , but , well , i don t really know . oh , did you want the truth about the movie ? as in , is it any good ? well , i m not the biggest expert in this area . you see , i ve only seen maybe 4 episodes of the television series , give or take one or two . so i m not a big x-phile . so it s safe to say that it s quite reassuring that i can say - yes . it s good . it s very good . it s great , in fact . the first true ride of the summer is here , and you ll be kicking yourself if you don t strap in to this one while it s in theaters - some of the images just won t translate as well onto a tv screen . if you haven t seen the film yet , get up and go now . wait , not now . you might want to read this review first . of course , that s really up to you , but still , you might want to . don t worry , i won t spoil anything . i make a point to only talk about maybe five minutes of the film and then leave the lesser-known details to you . okay , citizens . the x-files opens up with us seeing a freaky beast attack ancient humans in the b . c . caveman ages . the beast remains in shadows so that we re not quite sure what it is . cut to the present day . we see a mysterious black ooze ( i think fans of the tv series will recognize this , or so i m told ) inhabit a little boy who goes to the same spot where the cavemen were attacked so long ago . is there a connection ? does bea arthur look hideous naked ? and from there , we cut to our heroes , fbi agents mulder and scully . previously , they worked on the mysterious x-files , files found in the darker rooms of the fbi s hallways , files which detail cases too strange to be explained by rational thought and logical explanation . cases that seem to deal with the supernatural , or the extraterrestrial . . . or both . but that s ridiculous . well , scully thinks it s ridiculous . mulder believes all of it . anyway , the files have since been shut down after mulder pushed his beliefs a little too far and annoyed the wrong people . now he and scully are still a team , but they re a team of ordinary fbi agents , dealing with less interesting things , like terrorist threats . yeah , that s a big yawn , huh mulder ? of course , when something goes wrong in their new line of duty , the fbi looks for someone to blame for the foul-up , and even though it wasn t their fault , mulder and scully were there , and they re first in line to have the whole thing put on their heads . now they re going to try to clear their names , and along the way , they re going to learn a lot more about the mysterious conspiracy that s being run behind the scenes worldwide , to hide the real truth about just the kinds of things that mulder and scully used to investigate in the x-files division . of course , they can t learn everything - there s plenty more episodes of the series to be had , and future movies to be made . the performances are all acted by people who ve handled these roles for years on the tv show ( with the exception of martin landau playing a new character - and he s never bad , so of course that s just another good point ) . and since they ve had to time to develop the roles , they make us feel like we re watching developed , layered characters even if we don t watch the show much , or at all . we really care about mulder and scully - they actually have deep personalities , which is truly something to be appreciated , especially in today s film world . the action scenes are infrequent , but tense , and solid . really though , this story is driven by plot and dialogue . it s a winding plot that you have to pay attention to , especially if you re not a series afficianado , but trust me , it s worth it . some of the scenes are awe-inspiring , and the scope of some visuals , particularly towards the end , make you truly appreciate that this was made into a movie as opposed to just another episode of the show . the plot winds around and around but always holds your interest , thanks in part to great performances and in part to great writing that takes the time to give us characterizations of the people we re watching instead of just putting them through the paces . the effects , when they show up , are also great . seems like this movie works even for those who don t watch the show , and i also find it very hard to believe that those who do watch would be let down by this . if there s a flaw to this , it s that the villians aren t quite clearly explained enough . we understand their motives , but how did they come to reach these motives ? there had to be some kind of communication that we didn t learn about . i know , i know , i m keeping this pretty vague . but i can assure you , i m not digging too deep here , this is actually a question you need to ask yourself , and in the end , it s never quite answered . maybe series fans know more on this subject . though really , in such an otherwise great movie , why should i gripe about this ? i can t elaborate too much on things that were great because i wouldn t dare reveal the plot . you have to go and see it for yourself . and you d better . the summer has had some letdowns , and some fun , but so far , this is the best ride out there , and it s a damn good ride that could hold its own in any summer . . . or any season of any year , for that matter . one wonders if chris carter , the show s creator , can continue to make x-files films that can stand alone as their own series and still make them interesting and relevant to the viewers at home . but there s no need to worry about this now . now , all you have to do is go see the '

"   " well , " he shouts , laughing , " isn t that obvious ? " the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it s a bad thing to make decisions when you re suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman .   bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated .   suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth s no-nonsense " truth in politics " methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he s appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences . beatty s work on both sides of the camera is excellent .   his script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself .   here is a man who s reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure .   i like that the film doesn t take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) .   some of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him .   much of the film is completely absurd , but that s the fun part about it .   it s an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre .   what adds to this feeling is beatty s portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale .   beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he s always funny , but he s also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions .   beatty is so good that bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning . the supporting cast is vast and colorful .   berry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles .   don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work .   oliver platt is an actor who should be careful , for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he s very funny to watch ) .   paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections . is bulworth offensive ?   i suppose some may see it that way .   i wasn t offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics .   i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story .   the film isn t perfect , of course -- the ending didn t quite work for me , and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) .   but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film .   bulworth is a smart , uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface .   '
positiveC,' somewhere between big-budget action films and small-budget morality tales exists judgement night , a constantly exciting , always tense urban thriller about kids on the run . and no matter how you feel about foot-chase movies , or shoot-out movies ( or even movies that seldom show you the light of day ) , * this * movie is never less than engaging at any time . we first meet frank wyatt , a family man whose wife thinks he should stop hanging out with the guys who " have the hormones of teenagers " and start being around adults more . but frank hasn t been out of the house in a long while and he thinks he needs a breather . so , he tells his wife he loves her , kisses his baby s head ( just like any devoted father and husband should ) , and is off with his best friends for a night out . next , are mike , ray , and frank s brother ( whom he never , ever gets along with ) john . they all congregate in a van/bus , and are off to watch boxing in downtown chicago . wouldn t you know , traffic s too damn slow , and ray decides to get off the main highway for a short detour . and wouldn t you know , they find themselves in a part of town none of them has ever seen before . ray is determined to get them to the boxing match on time , but then a funny thing happens-- he hits some guy on the run from bad guys . the guys try to help out this stranger they ve nearly killed , but before you know it the bad guys show up and retrieve the strange man . enter fallon ( played by denis leary ) , a drug kingpin/mobster/whatever who pulls a gun and murders the man in cold blood . " rule number one : do not steal from me , " fallon states to his band of henchmen . " rule number two , no witnesses . " and so it goes , as this action-adventure is set into nonstop motion . given the amount of time this film in on the screen , and the number of long encounters which take place , not much time is allowed for much character development . so , there isn t any ( except if you count a whiner/wimp who only shows his true colors when it s too late ) . then again , developing characters who provide the grounds for a story that just about leaves you breathless , and nothing more , would be a waste of time , especially when the action is as good as it is here . we get fights in the sewers , on and off trains , in low-rent apartment buildings , and even ( the finale ) in a small shopping mall downtown . and each sequence has a distinct feel to it , and each is inventive enough to make you feel as though you haven t seen any of this before . the script , by lewis colick , is extremely derivative in its ways of executing action and suspense , and the score , by alan silvestri , ( when it can be heard through all the fantastic rap music ) sets a nice tone for what you see . director stephen hopkins , of predator ii fame , does what he couldn t do in that film with this one : make it credible enough for us to want to continue watching . true , this isn t a classical piece of cinema , but it does just what it needs to : stay on the screen as long as it needs to be there ( no longer , and no less ) , and excite us while we watch .

positiveC,' it must be tough to be a mob boss . just ask paul vitti ( robert deniro ) , a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing . i can believe it , too - one can t even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he s forced to choose between an ice pick , baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with . suffering from reoccurring panic attacks , paul decides he needs to consult some professional help . and who better than billy crystal . after appearing in bottom-of-the-barrel flops , father s day and my giant , crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here . playing vitti s private shrink , the two very different stars strike an unorthodox , but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish . casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in-joke , i think . placed in this mobster s shoes , deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather , part ii and casino . it s obvious he s having a lot of fun doing so . the man behind the camera is harold ramis , whose credits include ghostbusters ( as writer and star ) , and his best directing effort , the bill murray vehicle , groundhog day . ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what s funny , and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors . the only character who weakens the payoff is crystal s bride-to-be ( lisa kudrow ) . playing the same dumbed-down role as she does in friends , kudrow is amusing , but doesn t fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped . the supporting cast sparkles . joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly , vitti s pea brained right-hand man , and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster who s in desperate need of the definition of `closure  . the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout , putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides . the situation is just too cute to resist . it s unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand . but hey , if you re in the mafia , using obscenities probably comes naturally . and near the end , seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat .

positiveC,' " you ll go ape over tarzan because it s more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! " okay , there s the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie . disney s latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship . father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson . it s amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack . before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard . against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own . tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild . much of tarzan s young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his " father , " which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts . all he s looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults . when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end . look back on past disney animated features and you ll see the trend . growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends . one is an ape named terk ( rosie o donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) . both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold . i m beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films . just fill in the blanks ! can you see it ? " now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it . we ve already had a fish and a crab , and we ve had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have we had an ape and an elephant yet ? well , there we go ! " of course , there s gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through . together with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa . she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory " you tarzan , me jane " scene . thankfully , those aren t the exact words . however , i found it distracting that tarzan is going " ohh ohh ee ee " one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction . how does he tell his name to another ape ? " ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? " well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . but hey , tarzan s a young adult . do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? isn t that illegal in most countries ? oh , well . i don t think disney will be using my quote anymore . tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . there s lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . this isn t really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it s just different . do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . with each new feature , disney animation gets even better . not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn t just tarzan , it s " extreme tarzan . " however , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its " chandelier scene , " which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . lasting but a few seconds at most , it s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . as usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . the one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o donnell . going into the film , i didn t know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . her performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , " that s no boy ape , that rosie o donnell . " distracting to say the least . i ll admit i ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story " tarzan of the apes , " so i couldn t tell you how true this film stays to the book . but unless you re a purist , you should have few objections to this film . with solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . note : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . this time , i ll just say that i went to mcdonald s yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup .  nuff said .

you ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you . this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this . mr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense . all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp . now , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards . the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking . in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) . the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique . the movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship . the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes . now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end . the historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done . the method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less . regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at . the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing . if you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! ! it might not be the best movie in the world . . but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it . during none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie .

positiveC,' getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity . the film was directed by randal kleiser , who brought us such bubble-gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon . but thanks to kleiser s surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script , getting it right is a pleasantly quiet , moving , and memorable film--one geared strictly toward a sophisticated , adult audience . getting it right stars jesse birdsall ( emily lloyd s boyfriend in wish you were here ) as gavin , a painfully shy 31-year-old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who--gasp--is still a virgin . gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon , but expose him to a single 30-year-old beauty and he s a mess . much to gavin s surprise , the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan ( lynn redgrave ) , a rich , married , and lonely 45-year-old . getting it right is the simple story of gavin s awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right ; that is , to find the right woman to fulfill his life . getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in-depth character development . gavin s self-conscious voice-over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche . we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self-confident maturity . birdsall s superb , understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film ; he seems convincing and authentic throughout . the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin s life . despite her limited screen time , redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin s middle-aged seducer . for a supporting character , joan is unusually and impressively complex , thanks in large part to redgrave s magnificent performance . gavin is also pursued , or perhaps plagued , by minnie , the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat . after minnie and gavin meet at a party , she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life . helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role , and sir john gielgud , with his tongue in his cheek , embodies the height of arrogance as her father . gavin s eventual love-interest is jenny , the adorable twenty-year-old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon ; london stage actress jane horrocks  fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character . peter cook , the great british satirist , appears briefly in the film as gavin s uptight employer . the scenes of gavin s home life with his parents are also a treat . gavin s over-protective mother ( pat heywood ) , whom even woody allen would find overbearing , almost steals the movie . her life seems limited to just two activities : treating gavin like a 10-year-old and preparing exotic but inedible meals , such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce . gavin and his father s attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing . getting it right , for the most part , is very well-crafted , except for two minor shortcomings . first , the movie is about 15 minutes too long , and consequently it loses momentum at times . second , the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin s best friend , harry , and his unfaithful lover , winthrop . overall , however , getting it right is quite memorable for its humor , depth , sophistication , and outstanding acting . director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard ( adapting her own highly acclaimed novel ) deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth , maturation , and self-discovery .

positiveC,' written by stephen peters . directed by john mcnaughton . starring kevin bacon , matt dillon , neve campbell , denise richards , bill murray , robert wagner . rated r ( contains nudity , profanity , and violence ) 116 mins . synopsis : a wild teen-aged girl with an iq around 200 manipulates a beefy guidance counselor , a determined police detective , two trial lawyers , the u . s . judicial system , the news media , a millionaire playgirl , and her supersexy teen-aged daughter in an elaborate scheme to swindle millions of dollars . comments : for this week , i have decided to review a movie currently playing in theaters rather than an almost forgotten video collecting dust in the far corner of a rental outlet . this may become a trend as species 2 , a sequel to one of the best bad sci-fi films of the decade , is set to be released this friday ( april 10 , 1998 ) . anyway , this week s turkey is the sleazy , exploitative wild things , a film which shares quite a number of conventions with many of the b-level , direct-to-video-or-cable thrillers i have reviewed in the past . the movie , in fact , only possesses one noticeable difference : it has an all-star cast . let s be blunt for a moment . veteran film actors kevin bacon and matt dillon are technically the main stars here ; they are listed first in the credits and the majority of the film s running time favors them . wild things  producers , however , heavily advertised this movie as an erotic exercise between rising stars neve campbell and denise richards . the movie posters prominently feature the two rising out of a pool of water and staring at the viewer with sultry gazes . i suspect the target audience for this film was predominantly younger males ; though , surprisingly , the matinee showing i attended with my friend had an audience with far more women than men . if one s only reason to see wild things is to see ms . campbell and ms . richards get it on , then one will be remarkedly disappointed . a menage a trois does occur between the two ladies and matt dillon , but it is a poorly-lit , seemingly superfluous scene . the two also kiss a couple of times , but it feels mechanic and obligatory rather than racy as it was intended . neve campbell , by the way , does not strip naked at all . sorry , guys . wild things  advertised sexual fireworks fizzle here , but the movie itself , as bad movies go , is quite entertaining . the actors turn in hammy performances ( more on this in a bit ) , and the surprisingly complex script keeps the viewer guessing while the laughable dialogue is full of cheesy lines undercutting the seriousness of the subject matter . my friend and i chuckled throughout the movie , but the rest of the audience didn t seem to be in on it . don t go see wild things expecting a run-of-the-mill suspense film . ( it s an amusing exercise in sleaze populated with comically self-absorbed , greedy characters who all get what they deserve in the end . ) part of the film s qualified success comes from its cast . a number of fine , first-rate actors have fun with their characters . the attractive , young actress denise richards , of last year s megabudget starship troopers , nearly steals the show here as the pouty high-school student with a supermodel body who catches everyone s eyes . neve campbell , the scream queen of scream and scream 2 , drops her innocent , damsel-in-distress routine and turns 180 degrees in her role as the trailer trash girl who secretly instigates everything . the best supporting nods go to bill murray and robert wagner , both making surprise appearances in this , an atypical film for either of them . bill murray , in particular , is great as the fraud-obsessed lawyer who can sniff a lawsuit from a mile away . robert wagner is hilarious in his wooden portrayal of another lawyer . he seems to be doing a self-parody of himself which reminds me of his brief role in the john candy vehicle delirious . despite its humorous dialogue and delightfully smarmy actors , wild things cannot be excused for some of its shortcomings . while the first two-thirds of the movie moves at a breakneck pace , the last third becomes tired . without revealing too much , one character will kill another only to be killed by someone else . it becomes a cycle which tries the audience s patience . also , though this film is designed to be unexpectedly funny , a subplot deals with an affair that a guidance counselor has with two of his students . this seems inexcusably unethical and borders on pedophilia ( the students , to give wild things the benefit of the doubt , may be 18 ) . the audience should feel uneasy when they realize they are viewing what is supposed to be a sexual affair between a high school teacher and his students . wild things ends on a somewhat unique note . important background flashbacks are interspersed throughout the closing credits , and they are rather fun to watch . so , don t get up and walk out the theater as soon as you see the closing credits start to roll at the end . all in all , wild things is a pretty good and humorous turkey . it s certainly not for everyone , but for those who are into exploitative thrillers like basic instinct or sliver , you could find a lot worse than this .

positiveC,' directed by milos forman . written by peter shaffer ( based on his play ) . running time : 158 minutes . rated pg ( for language and sexual references ) . amadeus is considered one of the best films of the 1980s . that decade mostly developed brat pack films so there s no doubt that the epic film would be one of the best . it made the american film institute s top 100 list in the summer of 1998 . although it is not as good as some of the films near the bottom or off the list it still deserves it s place in cinema . antonio salieri ( f . murray abraham ) is a struggling composer who has worked hard to become great . throughout his childhood he has seen a little boy named wolfgang amadeus mozart . the young boy performed for royalty . when mozart grows up he is a giddy , over excited brat ( played now by tom hulce ) who makes obscene comments to women and curses . salieri can t understand why god has chosen such a delinquent to pass his music through . salieri swears hatred on mozart and the god who raised him to his status . the highlight of this movie is , of course , the music . john strauss did much of it but also included music by mozart , salieri , and giovanni battista pergolesi . the music is used beautifully in the many operas that take place during the movie . hulce and abraham do a great job acting during their many scenes of conducting and piano playing . abraham and hulce each were awarded academy award recognition which they deserve . abraham won best actor over hulce , which isn t wrong because two people can t win . abraham plays salieri with all the hatred he can without becoming an evil character . he has no heart and just wants the life that he thinks was taken from him as a brilliant composer . hulce does an excellent job as well as the eccentric mozart . he is able to act extremely serious during his compositions but then chase a woman around a house . this was easily his best role to date . he is very well cast with his young looking face and acting talent . director milos forman along with cinematographer miroslav ondrícek and the art and production designers have created one beautiful movie . the opera theater scenes , along with wonderful wigs , costumes , and makeup , are a delight to watch . the use of scope is also very good . now to why i believe amadeus to be less a film then the afi makes it to be . while i do really like many things about this movie i still have some complaints . the movie is quite long at 158 minutes . the movie isn t boring and is much shorter than other epics but it is still quite a long time . a couple of scenes could have been shortened and not have hurt the movie much . with my complaint aside , i can still say that amadeus was definitely one of the better movies to come out in the 80s . i don t know if it s one of 100 best of all time but it is a very good movie .

positiveC,' " everybody has a story about chet baker . he was bad , trouble , and beautiful . " let s get lost , bruce weber s visually thematic biography of  50s jazz musician chet baker , might well be the ultimate story , an evocatively photographed , seamlessly edited collage of sights and sounds . unfortunately , many people are going to pass up the film for two reasons : one , it s a documentary -- and two , it s in black and white . but those two elements alone combine to make let s get lost more compelling than most of this summer s run-of-the-mill movie fodder . the life and times of this jazz trumpeter and vocalist , whose troubled career culminated in a fall to his death from an amsterdam hotel window in may of 1988 , is chronicled through a variety of cinematic techniques . candid interviews with an ensemble of friends , relatives , and fellow musicians , stills , archive footage of baker himself , in concert and out , moody , mesmerizing , iconoclastic . baker s whisper-like vocals permeate the background like cigarette smoke , ever present , softly punctuating the blank spaces . it s a near perfect blend of styles , yet it is never showy or pushy . in his 20s , baker was the james dean of the jazz world , his boyish good looks as much a part of his image as his hypnotic trumpet playing and soulful , lyrical style . working initially with the likes of charlie parker and gerry mulligan , baker quickly branched out on his own . soon his angular face was gracing record jackets everywhere . he even appeared in a number of movie bit parts , such as 1955 s hell s horizon ( billed as " chet baker and his trumpet " ) , as well as a number of disposable , italian teen-flicks . almost forty years later , the change is dramatic . baker s once adonis-like looks are wizened -- wrinkled creases of skin abound ; aged , hollowed out eyes ; bloodless cheeks ; a leather-faced , lipless junkie . baker knew more than anyone that you gotta pay the price if you wanna play the blues . baker s midas touch on stage became leprous in his private life . a compulsive womanizer , he left a legacy of cast-off wives and embittered offspring in his wake . there is a lot of hate in this movie ; few people have much respect for this burned out , unlikable shell of a man . even his mother , when asked if chet was a good son , cannot answer in the affirmative . what s so compelling about the film is that , as unappealing as baker is , his music is anything but . the only time that we feel he s being totally honest with us is when he s performing . then , and only then , do we feel the man s sincerity , his quietly hushed and sexy vocal style totally absorbing the viewer . the allure of his stage persona compared to the shambles of his personal life is staggering . in one scene , baker recalls the names of other jazz greats who have succumbed to the lure of drugs . the list seems endless . but this is not an anti-drug movie . it s a film about contrasts , about the profound affect one man had on the lives of others . director weber has gotten to the crux of the issue so adeptly that at times it s hard to believe that a lot of this film was shot before baker s death . at cannes , nearing the film s end , baker comments to weber that this is the first time he has ever faced such a rowdy audience . " at those other places you could hear a pin drop , " he observes . so when he calls for silence before performing his final , haunting number , " almost blue , " you probably could hear a pin drop . that silence , and the performance which follows , is a fitting elegy to a genius who lived hard yet made it all look so easy . | directed by : bruce weber david n . butterworth - university of pa | | rating ( l . maltin ) :  internet : butterworth@a1 . mscf . upenn . edu | '

positiveC,' by nathaniel r . atcheson ( nate@pyramid . net ) city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental . i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . city of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . it s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we re so used to seeing in films like this . city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders  1988 film wings of desire . i have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two . i have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn t a rip-off of its source material . nicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) . one day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her . the angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can t experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch ) . he shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status . seth wants to become human so he can feel her . that s when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , " former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . " ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . ) messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human . seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . this , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead . since i love this film so much , i ll make a minor note that it certainly isn t perfect . although it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre . the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them ) . the ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable . these elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels . the acting is superb from everyone involved . this is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) . he s quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words . he s perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he s not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face/off ) . meg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly-chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best . dennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel . what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation . director brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality . his direction is steady , and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning , maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . there is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information . this is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real . the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do . cinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i ve seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) . the music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it s quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . it s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously .

positiveC,' 1997 , r , 95 minutes [1 hour , 35 minutes]starring : dustin hoffman ( stanley motss ) , robert de niro ( conrad brean ) , anne heche ( winifred ames ) , denis leary ( fad king ) , written by hilary henkin , david mamet ; produced by robert de niro , barry levinson , jane rosenthal ; directed by barry levinson ; based on the novel " american hero " by larry beinhart . satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . " dr . strangelove " ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . " men in black " ) . what s unique about " wag the dog " is that it doesn t necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time . the result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . if there s anything that affects americans the most it s politics and showbusiness . in this age of information and technology , we ve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it s gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . we need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn t someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? that s the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president s good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . brean , along with the president s top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . they pitch him an idea to " produce " the image of a war with albania ( it s a country no one s heard of so they people will buy it ) . soon the wheels are in motion and the film s riffing satire comes into play . we re inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news . the characters  dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque . for example , one scene shows motss and brean s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . since it s all computer-enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . this demonstrates the film s ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . but then there s the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress s name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , " this is nothing ! " by the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . the first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it s always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . however , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . what had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . still , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . willie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and " wag the dog " at least succeeds in this respect . however , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . then again , it s a valiant effort . please visit chad z movie page @ http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz - over 180 new and old films reviewed in depth , not just blind ratings and quick capsules . also , check out the first shay astar web page @ http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz/shayastar . html '

positiveC,' the age of innocence a film by martin scorsese starring : daniel day-lewis , winona ryder , and michelle pfeiffer written by jay cocks and martin scorsese based on the novel by edith wharton martin scorsese s triumphant adaptation of edith wharton s the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life . it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900 s , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker . this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese s finest . newland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful . the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others . on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer s life . archer is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen . archer is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world . archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status . the film s subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not . it is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions . there is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for . in truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn t know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun . the performances are absolutely breathtaking . day-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take . pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well . ryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending . the supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one s memory . scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking . his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight . he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery . his script is also excellent , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed . it is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese , however , does it beautifully . the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere . he is patient , but he films everything and anything remotely important . the cameras sweep , pan , track , and do more than they ve ever done , but they are so subtle , one doesn t realize he s watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing . the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot , but the viewer doesn t notice it , because we want to see more of this gorgeous world . there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding , and joanne woodward  narration is exquisite . not a fast film like goodfellas , this shares more in common with kundun than anything else . and like kundun , this is a slow-starting film that truly shines , when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end . a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year .

positiveC,' saving private ryan ( dreamworks ) running time : 2 hours 48 minutes . starring tom hanks , edward burns , tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the  greatest war movie ever made ,   saving private ryan is an harrowing , saddening and riveting movie . it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion , but it s certainly one of the best war movies made , and one of the best of 1998 . tom hanks stars as a captain who s troop has to find private ryan ( damon ) who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action . action , drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him . after the disappointing amistad ( 1997 ) spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie . i m not the war movie genre biggest fan , but i found this film to be gripping , and very scary , thanks to the excellent cast , direction and terrifying battle scenes . tom hanks is superb , straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles , such as in forrest gump ( 1994 ) . this time , he plays the role with gritty realism , and is much better for it . occasionally he overacts the sentimentally , but he generally delivers a fine performance . edward burns , looking a lot like armageddon s ben affleck , also delivers a top notch performance , moving away from his roles in films such as she s the one ( 1996 ) tom sizemore makes less of an impact , but is still watchable , and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today . spielberg directs very well , putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes . and what battle scenes they are ! they re truly terrifying , yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen . the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand-held camera , and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique . the gore and violence isn t spared either , which body parts flying , and blood spurting . this film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults . other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90 s film making . the cinematography is excellent , and the music score by john william s is also superb . it is never intrusive , and adds to the drama on-screen . but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan , there s one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film : the writing . it is unusually flat , with many of the speeches strangely weak . the film never really makes any profound statements . this is not a major gripe , as private ryan is a film of action , not words . still , the script could of been a lot better . thankfully , the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines . saving private ryan , in the end , is an excellent film , but not the  greatest war movie  due to it s weak acting . this film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it , as it s rewarding and extremely worthwhile . it really shouldn t be missed , and dreamworks skg has finally found it s first hit movie .

positiveC,' first , i d like to say it s nice to have spike lee vindicate himself after doing something like girl 6 . get on the bus is easily the best film he has made since do the right thing with the exception of maybe malcolm x . spike does in this film what he does best--he presents issues that face society in an unbiased manner and lets the audience sort their feelings on their own . i love a film that engages my mind . the story is about a busload of black men that board in south central los angeles and drive across the country to the million man march in washington d . c . the film was funded by fifteen african-american men and shot in just 18 days . this is another example of expert filmmaking ( writing , directing , acting ) that i hope the oscars do not overlook . the screenwriter , reggie rock bythewood is very talented . however , i would say that the screenplay is a little weak in a few spots . this may be due to the film s hurried production . but i tell you that nothing in the script is so bad as to detract from the better scenes . the greatest aspect of the screenplay is that the ideas behind the million man march and the reasons for going are expressed without directly involving the march itself . this makes those ideas much more powerful because it eliminates the inclusion of minister farrakhan , to which many would disregard the march s message in favor of claiming it racist and sexist . this idea is also expressed in another way . there is a member of the nation of islam on the bus who never says a word and never gets involved in any of the scenes . his presence is a symbol of the march , in that , even though the nation of islam was there and organized the march , the march was not about the nation of islam . spike lee is one of the best filmmakers working today . in get on the bus , he s trying something different--the sure sign of a filmmaker that understands that the learning process never stops . here , he meshes his ever-evolving style with that of a documentarian s eye . the bus ride feels " captured " by the filmmaker . although there is plenty of hand-held camerawork , it is as though spike lee was able to film a documentary and still maintain effective use of dollies , cranes and tripods . it is an astonishing feat from a filmmaker s perspective and an effective technique for anyone watching . as i watched the film , i noticed two things about the audience . the first was that anytime a character made a slant toward one of the homosexual characters , the audience laughed hysterically . the scenes were obviously written to be funny , but i think that the predictability of our own stereotypes was what the screenwriter was knowingly commenting on . i back this up with another scene where the bus stops at a roadside diner in tennessee . the instant we see all the white faces inside , the audience expects a confrontation . in fact , everyone gets along pretty well . even when ossie davis explains that steer wrestling was invented by a black cowboy , his listener responds with , " how about that . " it s fairly obvious that these two scenes say more about the audience than the characters . but then , that s what i expect from a spike lee joint . '
positiveC,' with storytelling this compelling , who needs books ? based on the book by author james ellroy , l . a . confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years . together with director curtis hanson ( the hand that rocks the cradle , the river wild ) whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film , resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight , an atom would have to squeeze itself through . set in the 50s , the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities . jack vincennes ( spacey ) is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style , concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention . there is also the young hot-shot rookie , ed exley ( pearce ) , fresh out of the academy and all-out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father . the tough and unnerving bud white ( crowe ) , a cop who believes in justice , the swift and violent way . 3 policemen , distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil . when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation , bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder . even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case , happenings began to link itself to the murder . the 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised-crime in hollywood . the last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects . in l . a . confidential , you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of `story  going for it . there is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all . surprisingly , though spacey did a very convincing job as the street-wise vincennes , the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns  , pearce and crowe . pearce s exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance . crowe s bud white is the most impressive of all ; head-strong and temperamental , he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here . superb acting . , wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever . easily the best hollywood piece for 1997 .

" pauline at the beach , " is not a film in which big dramatic things occur , and there is not a clear-cut , tidy conclusion to the story . instead , it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life , and the surprises come from little character details . the film is quite talky and slow moving , and so it is pretty safe to say it isn t for those who are only a fan of action movies , but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big-budget genre and see a good art film . this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer ( 1969 s " my night at mauds , " and 1971 s " claire s knee " ) that i have seen , but his direction is assured and intelligent , as is the screenplay , which he also wrote . " pauline at the beach , " is a film worth seeing . '

( remember bob ? ) the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it s consistently interesting , it s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , " what goes around really goes around . " shortly thereafter , he begins to sing " time is on my side " as he s taken on his last walk . minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn t a normal psychopath  he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . and , with reese s death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they re up against . the rest of the cops , including hobbes  partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don t have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place  a gothic city rather than a modern one . no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . the most famous landmark to appear isn t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it s geno s steaks . shadows and night scenes abound . the days are cloudy and unpromising . this is the kind of setting where it s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . fallen s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . sadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring . washington s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . it s not that he s bad per se , but he s not very interesting . there s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . washington s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler s list ) and donald sutherland . to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren t all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . that said , however , there s nothing inspired about either davidtz s or sutherland s work . both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . at times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like " i like the night sometimes you come face to face with yourself " become a little hard to swallow . in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . however , despite the negatives , i m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . it s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . this is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . and , whatever you do , don t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll .

positiveC,' did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow . she is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder . the dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer s moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win . jeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history . he is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber . his remorse for his wife s comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980 . the background to the case is such . during christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke . the same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will . when examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood . claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail . he immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him . ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him . we follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn t commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn t figured out . dershowitz doesn t know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case . nevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him . together with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed . silver s performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film . schroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz . there are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical . yet , due to glenn close s troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well . the flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder doesn t fill in the blanks . the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending . the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion . the supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz s team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters . yet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons . as von bulow , he is brutally evil . anti-semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame . irons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence . he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder . however , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility . there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife s death by years of neglect and coldness . however , legally , did he do the murder ? schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind . with all the character flaws , reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind . schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations , and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow , in death . for all the failed dramatic theatrics , this is one that works beautifully . we don t know what happened . that sense of legal ambiguousness , along with von bulow s obvious moral guilt , is why reversalf fortune works . in the end , von bulow is as sadistic as ever . irons is haunting , and that is why reversal of fortune is so good .

" so to hell with webster s -- " chicken run " is one of the funnest movies i ve seen in a while . i can t remember the last time i ve seen anything funner . the chickens at tweedy s farm are up to something . living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm s egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , " chickens go in ; pies come out . " what sort of pies ? chicken pies , of course . co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : " creature comforts , " " the wrong trousers , " and " a close shave . " the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . part of what made the " wallace " films brilliantly entertaining was park s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . " the wrong trousers , " for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and " a close shave " owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in " chicken run . " the plot is largely lifted from " the great escape " ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . thing is , the film doesn t feel like it s been lifted from somewhere else ; " chicken run " feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? park and lord milk the incongruity for all it s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . but they re * chickens * , so it s funny to us . another thing that helps " chicken run " ( and most of park s films ) succeed is the animators  subtle way of giving nods to the very films they re cribbing . there are references to " the great escape , " obviously , and " stalag 17 . " the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both " raiders of the lost ark " and " indiana jones and the temple of doom . " there s even a nod to " the blues brothers , " if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson s nationality and film history . the " braveheart " reference is a hoot if you catch it . when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , " chicken run " is downright brilliant in its execution . consider this : since july of last year , i ve seen dozens upon dozens of " blair witch project " parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . why ? because once you got past the thought that " they re parodying that  blair witch  movie , " most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . conversely , " chicken run " doesn t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . if you ve never seen " indiana jones , " the chase sequence is still fun . even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it s understood , and as a result , " chicken run " is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . enjoyment of this movie doesn t require knowledge of film history , but if you ve got it , " chicken run " is that much richer . the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on " absolutely fabulous " ) nails it . she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . the characters  inevitable romance doesn t feel contrived , but sweet . poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn t any help . jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . they even come up with an inspired riff on something that s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of " chicken run , " it comes as a delightful surprise . the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . the animation is first-rate . remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable " chicken run " really is . this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios  animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . as in such top-notch family fare as " a bug s life " or " toy story 2 , " " chicken run " has something to offer in nearly every frame . certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the details . anyway , the movie s just a boatload of fun . funnest damn movie i ve seen all year .

positiveC,' `blue streak  , martin lawrence s newest outing and first appearance without a big name star by his side ( life , bad boys ) , may be cliched and formulaic , but it entertains , none the less . however , be warned that if you re not a martin lawrence fan you should stay far away from this film , as it is carried almost entirely by his comic antics . the story opens with a gang of high-tech thieves led by miles logan breaking into what appears to be a jewelry store . the robbery has just been completed , when one of the gang pulls a double cross and accidentally alerts the police . miles manages to secure the stolen gem in an air duct of an uncompleted building before the police catch him . two years later , released from prison , miles goes back to recover his prize only to discover that the building is now a police station . what is the most obvious solution ? why , to disguise himself as a cop and join the ranks of course . as a by-the-numbers piece of film making , it is fairly easy to guess the outcome of this movie from the start , though i won t reveal it here . in fact , the only things that truly make this worth seeing are the performances by martin lawrence and luke wilson as his likable , yet incredibly naive partner . lawrence s talent stems mainly from his exaggerated speech and facial expressions , and he puts this talent to good use here . just watch his expressions in a scene in which a dozen or so cops have cornered him and are asking what his opinion is about some new piece of police equipment . unfortunately , there are some rather large problems with this movie in addition to the predictable script . first , there are several utterly pointless characters such as melissa green , a defense attorney who appears in only three or four scenes , and is apparently present only so the audience can dislike her . the film s largest annoyance comes from tulley , who is a friend of logan s from the jewel heist . chappelle has such a whiny , obnoxious voice that i saw several people in the audience cringing whenever he spoke . despite these problems , the movie is a lot of fun , and lawrence is clearly having the time of his life making it . i simply hope that next time he finds a more original script to house his rather considerable comic talent . for delivering a lot of chuckles and a few belly laughs , i give `blue streak  three and a half stars and a recommendation to try and catch a matinee . * * * * * - one of the greatest movies ever made , see it now . * * * * - great flick . try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie , hits and misses . * * - pretty bad . see it if you ve got nothing better to do . * - one of the worst movies ever . see it only if you enjoy pain . e-mail with comments at : jabii@aol . com '
positiveC,' it s an interesting premise . our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . in truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . what we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . our bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . the sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . the matrix isn t it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one s brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . the group s leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is " the one " who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . this , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . what is reality ? what is a sham ? the film turns our very perception of life on its side . more than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . as viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo . and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? reeves , whom i ve never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety . he was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught . in a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . i mean , since bill and ted s excellent adventure , what movie could you say really " utilized " keanu reeves ? more interesting than reeves is fishburne , who s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . very surprising for a sci-fi movie . fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect . this helps to further the aura of his character s proficiency and extensive knowledge . hugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence s anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . unfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character s speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . carrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus s number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . although her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn t in the picture . there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . many methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . of special note is the use of the " freeze and turn " effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle . this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . the motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . pretty slick . the matrix drips with style . from the clothing to the music to the action , we re watching an exaggerated version of what we re used to . much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there s a lot of kung fu , there s a lot of gunplay . when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . there s also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . combined , it s really like no live-action film i have ever seen . the film is not without its faults . some of the scenes and ideas are " borrowed " a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . some of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn t meant to be a joke . however , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain .

positiveC,' the happy bastard s quick movie reviewfor a minute there , i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney s latest , another adaptation of a legend from the past . ( remember the pathetic pocahontas ? yikes ! ) but guess what- disney , a company that s been on a roll lately with animated films , strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you . the story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who s lost her young adopts him into her group . as he matures into a much older man , tarzan still wonders just why he s so much different from the clan , and then arrives a hunter , a professor , and the professor s lovely daughter , jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons . from there , tarzan faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england ? the voicework here is pretty top-level . tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already-beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o  donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan s best ape friend terk ; and wayne " newman " knight has his moments as a panicky elephant . the movie is superb throughout , mixing a great script with incredible computer-assisted visuals . when tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol  vine swinging- and a great one , i might add ) , the camera twists and turns , allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly . i couldn t believe my eyes- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast . and the music s not half bad , either . fortunately , there s no ridiculous singing characters here , just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood . there s some great action sequences here as well , including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan , jane , and the aforementioned babboons . but , of course , it s not all action- there s a message here as well that has to do with family . this is easily one of disney s best animated films of the decade and it s one i can t wait to put in my home library . . . that is , if my vcr still works in the year 2000 .

positiveC,' big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america . o . j . simpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers . all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms . and , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood . whether it be john grisham s thrilling novels or television s famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks . so when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat . however , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one . john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it . no one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever . but , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting . a civil action is not john s best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 . travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations . his performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid . if he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average . luckily , he has a strong supporting cast . william h . macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood . he continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor . in a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta s paranoid and greedy accountant . he is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film . he is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant . but , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action . robert duvall is also an underrated actor . he gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey . duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant . duvall is magical in this role . he is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way . in many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes . unfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks , anyone ? ) . however , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed . this is not the case in a civil action . they have comedy coming from all sides . whether it be duvall s inane questions or macy s sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace . granted , it s not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film . the plot is terrific- somewhat . the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom . then the case that will make or break jan ( travolta )  s career rears its ugly head . they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it . however , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt . i will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film . the courtroom debates are great , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored . it left me somewhat confused , although the rest of the film is terrific . all in all , john travolta is back yet again in this great film . his supporting cast , consisting of macy and duvall , turn in tremendous performances , which ease the load on travolta . the film is smart , witty and thought provoking . not only does it gauge in-court battles , but also the various tolls it can take on the major players . a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves .

positiveC,' director : warren beatty || screenplay : warren beatty and jeremy pikser || stars : warren beatty ( jay billington bulworth ) , halle berry ( nina ) , oliver platt ( dennis murphy ) , don cheadle ( l . d . ) , paul sorvino ( graham crockett ) , jack warden ( eddie davers ) , christine baranski ( constance bulworth ) , joshua malina ( bill feldman ) || mpaa rating : r warren beatty s " bulworth " is a caustic political comedy that doesn t attack any particular political group , but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system . some might think this film is vulgar , and in many ways it is . however , as loud and raucous as it is , " bulworth " speaks the truth , which is almost always ugly to hear . beatty , who directed the film and co-wrote the script with jeremy pikser ( " the lemon sisters " ) , stars as incumbent u . s . senator jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician names in cinema history . bulworth is a democrat , and in beatty s view , he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party . once an ideological liberal ( like beatty still is ) , bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington . instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden , which was once the calling card of democrats , bulworth has become another sell-out money hound - if he s not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he s making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , " america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium . . . . blah , blah , blah . " when the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become . in a fit of desperation , he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he doesn t know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place . knowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general . at a compton church , he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u . s . unless they " put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife . " later , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he s there is because " my guys always put the big jews on my schedule . " all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade , bulworth s chief of staff , dennis murphy ( oliver platt ) , follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment . platt has some of the movie s funniest scenes , as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet . his constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth s stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy s refusal to explain bulworth s actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason . when bulworth decides he wants to live after all , and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who s trailing him at every turn , he hides out in the ghetto , complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews . at this point , beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience . bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) , who he meets at the harlem church rally . she has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l . d . ( don cheadle of " boogie nights " ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth s campaign . some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like " boyz n hood " ( 1991 ) and " menace ii society " ( 1993 ) . " bulworth s " chief liability is beatty s insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device . instead of speaking at political rallies , he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip-hop stars are black . it s hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad , or whether he s actually that incompetent . at any rate , the rap sounds more run d . m . c . than snoop doggy dogg , which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary . beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner-city lingo and working that into his speeches , instead of trying to sound like l . l . cool j . other than that , " bulworth " hits all its targets with wry , hilarious accuracy . the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party , and even if you don t agree with beatty s liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government , it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics . unlike " primary colors " which opened earlier this year , " bulworth " doesn t try to tip-toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home - instead , it takes them dead-on .

positiveC,' what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker . the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! i can hear batfans everywhere protesting : " first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! " and , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play . nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman . nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the  60s tv series ) . on one hand , nicholson s joker is extremely funny . his murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film . but on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind . the joker s cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister . this guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it ! but enough about nicholson as the joker : i m sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman . like many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader . but batfans need not worry becauseholy unconventional casting ! keaton delivers . he is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman . even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city . visually , batman is a knockoutnothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team . the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as " the dark knight returns " and " the killing joke . " burton s film is a feast for the eyes ; the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen . the sets , costumes , and make-up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations . nicholson isn t joking when he boasts , " wait  till they get a load of me !

( alfred pennyworth ) , bob hastings ( commissioner gordon ) not rated ( but it s probably a pg , just like the last animated batman film was ) that having been said , let it be known that possibly the greatest interpretation of batman to hit tv or movie screens is the animated bat that first appeared in the fall of 1992 on fox . it quickly became a prime time series before hitting the big time - an animated theatrical release film . that was batman : mask of the phantasm ( 1993 ) . clearly , it was and still is the best batman film to yet hit theaters . the plot was intelligent , the action loud and exciting , the voice-acting perfect , and the score beautiful . as of this year , on tv , batman has moved his animated adventures to the wb network . characters have grown , and , most noticably , design styles for many of the characters have changed - mostly for the worse . as a result , for both those who watch the series , and those casual bat-fans who have only seen the first animated film , this second animated feature ( which has gone straight to video ) , batman & mr . freeze : subzero , is like reuniting with an old friend . the film tells a story that takes place before the current season of the show and after the final season on fox , so the character designs the like are all in line with those of the earlier part of the series . only better animated than usually seen on the show . this is a level of animation slightly under that seen in batman : mask of the phantasm but still slightly higher than that seen on the tv series . one thing this movie does have other mask of the phantasm is more use of computer animation . there s a cg submarine , batwing , and highway scene for your viewing pleasure , and all of them look very nice . of course , animation comes secondary to plot . plot , action , dialogue , and of course , acting are what drive a film . well , on the old batman scale , subzero is not quite as good as phantasm was , and maybe not even as good as the first two tim burton live-action films , though that could be debated . it s certainly much better than the last two joel schumacher films - and it s truer to the characters than any of the live action films to date . the plot goes that mr . freeze s wife , nora fries , still in cryo-sleep , has her stasis tube broken open in an accident . now freeze knows that the only thing that can save her is an organ transplant . he enlists the help of dr . belson , and , when no deceased donors of nora s rare blood type are found , freeze decides that he will use a live donor - which of course , will kill said donor . there s 18 live donors of nora s blood type in gotham . and one of them is barbara gordon . luckily , barbara only appears in batgirl garb for about one minute near the beginning of the movie , and stays out of costume for the rest while batman and robin try to save her - and she tries to save herself . the whole thing is better animated than most of the non-disney stuff you see ( well , those big-time other-studio releases like anastasia [1997] not withstanding , i guess ) and has that same simple-yet-beautiful character design of the max fleischer superman cartoons from the days of yore . all the characters are well-done . of course batman is cool , but wow , so are robin and barbara . now that s a feat . belson is interesting , and mr . freeze is cold and emotionless , as he should be , thanks to ansara ( i promise he s not at all jokey , like schwarzenegger ) , and overall , i assure you , this is a much better experience than that schumacher piece of crap batman & robin ( 1997 ) that had many of the same characters . in all , though it runs a too-short 67 minutes , and yes , it has appearances by batgirl and robin ( come on , you * know * that robin isn t always a bad character ) , this is still definitely worth a rent . . . and if you re a big batfan . . . it s worth a purchase . watch it , then rewind , and enjoy it again . hey wb . . . you want a good batman film to add to your live-action franchise ? why not put paul dini and bruce timm in charge ? !

positiveC,' release date : september 18 , 1998 starring : jackie chan , chris tucker , tom wilkinson , elizabeth pena , tzi ma , julia hsu directed by : brett ratner distributed by : new line cinema mpaa rating : pg-13 ( sequences of action/violence and shootings , language ) url : http : //www . execpc . com/~kinnopio/reviews/1998/rushhour . htm it s no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office . a poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs . in directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie . in addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types . the two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together . jackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts . the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one . chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there s no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn t believe their eyes the first time . chris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan s performance . he works perfectly with the script , and it s quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines . almost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent . we re quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd . cut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters . the fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help . the fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective . it s here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up . rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it doesn t quite reach the top tier of action-comedies like last year s grosse pointe blank . there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback . also , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing . however , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background . almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it s tucker s toned-down routine or chan s tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types . a recommendable visit to the theater , indeed .

positiveC,' i rented this movie with very high hopes . this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking . first of all , the casting for this film is great . tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood . they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly . with a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast . tobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability . william h . macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a " colored " person and his friends , the " non-colored " ones . he also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife . he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood . joan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom . her character is the most ambitious . she is very naïve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that . her lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better . as said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance . his character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction . his character is very confusing and he is not very believable . this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance . the movie is very provocative . it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today . i really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing . they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace . the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length . some films are not meant to be that long . pleasantville is one of those films . this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it . first , they are amazed by the implementation of color . then they want to have it . then they do not want to . then the war ensues between the colored and non-colored . this is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long . some movies need a lot of time . saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time . this film is only two hours long , and seems much longer . length is everything in films . if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle . pleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough . overall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days . i went in expecting a light-hearted film about change . i left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change . luckily , pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences . only if it could have done in a shorter amount of time .

positiveC,' in this lighthearted , unpretentious comedy , daniel auteuil sheds the intensity of his previous roles -- in les voleurs , ma saison préférée , manon of the spring , to name just a few -- and plays a shy , crooked-nosed accountant too boring to be tolerated by just about anyone . his françois pignon -- an appropriate name for somebody who is about to be fired , literally , for being a bore -- is a harmless placeholder who has no ambitions and no misconceptions about who he is . pignon s wife couldn t stand him and left two years ago , yet he still phones regularly to her and their indifferent teenage son . after learning that he is soon to be fired , pignon , distraught , returns home and meets that " perfect stranger " we all want to meet someday : the one who steps into our life and brings magic into it . from that moment on , the neighbor , belone ( michel aumont ) , navigates pignon s life like a chess game . belone easily persuades françois to concoct a story about his homosexuality so his boss will fear a discrimination lawsuit , superimposes photographic images and -- voila -- produces a shot of pignon in a leather-clad embrace with another man in bun-exposed pants . the photo gets sent to pignon s employer , and the events start spinning like a windmill in stormy weather , eventually changing pignon s life forever . oddly , for the rest of the story , the closet flirts with being politically correct and is as predictable as it only can be . what gives the film a tint of pleasure and saves it from being totally grotesque and improbable is that the movie never aspires to be anything more than what it is . director francis veber ( the dinner game ) finds a delightful irony in the fact that pignon has to lie that he doesn t like women in order to prove he is a man . we , of course , will learn that there is so much more to pignon than he and his colleagues could ever imagine . while watching the film , i caught myself feeling surprised that such a banal movie could actually be off-the-cuff and entertaining . the most distasteful thought in the closet is how little people really care about political correctness but how diligent they are in pretending the opposite . office politics always reveal people at their most vile : there is something unquestionably disturbing and familiar in watching petty little personalities trapped in their small trivial lives as they entertain themselves with self-made gossip and lies . besides auteuil , the acting , for the most part , is adequate . gérard depardieu , for example , starts off great as a gauche , self-righteous macho rugby couch , a racist , and a homophobe . however , as pignon gets his job back , depardieu s colleagues make him fearful for his own job for calling pignon a " fruit . " the situation becomes repetitiously improbable and depardieu is annoying and unconvincing as we learn that he might actually be the one " coming out of the closet . " michèle laroque is especially good as mademoiselle bertrand , pignon s boss , who not only discovers a real pignon and subsequently seduces him , but also demonstrates to us how smart women master the most impossible situations . though maybe not quite so impossible as this film .

positiveC,' steven spielberg s second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film . spielberg , ever the student on film , has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest , and most powerful entries . he also managed to cast this era s greatest answer to jimmy stewart , tom hanks , who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle . for about 160 out of its 170 minutes , " saving private ryan " is flawless . literally . the plot is simple enough . after the epic d-day invasion ( whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular ) , capt . john miller ( hanks ) and his team are forced to search for a pvt . james ryan ( damon ) , whose brothers have all died in battle . once they find him , they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home . accompanying miller are his crew , played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational . barry pepper , adam goldberg , vin diesel , giovanni ribisi , davies , and burns are the team sent to find one man , and bring him home . the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary . literally . there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film s first 20 minutes . spielberg films almost the entire movie without music , leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion , and they do to perfection . the sequences in france , all of them , beginning with the battle and ending with the battle , are fabulous , especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides , trying to save private ryan . there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences . this is what coppola was looking for in " apocalypse now " , but couldn t create . the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war . the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary . he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world , with his comic timing , dramatic flair , his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears . hanks is this country s finest actor , and he proves it here . however , spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece . with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time , spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film . the sequence involving army chief-of-stafff george marshall and mrs . ryan is decent , but doesn t hold up to the rest of the film , relying on wartime cliches to power it . but that is forgivable . what isn t is the bookends of the film , the cemetary sequences . the first one is quite good , a decent introduction into the lives of these men . the last sequence is atrocious . the forced emotion , accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music , is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film . these flaws are what downgrade " ryan " from the greatest film of our era , to the greatest war film of our era . spielberg should have trusted his own material , and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie , to end his masterpiece right there . the use of the flag , though patriotic , is in contrast to the movie s theme . the power of the bulk of the film , however , is astonishing . spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art , that persists even after first viewing of the film , is extraordinary . this is the film of the year .

positiveC,' i was pleasantly surprised by this film . with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century s greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see . how much could you dress up the sets ? how many models and computer effects could you use ? how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? oh , if i ve just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school . after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie . there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i ve seen . titanic tells its story in two time periods . it starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship . what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news . the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas . there she tells her story to lovett and his team . in 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society s upper class , boards the titanic for the ship s first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york . she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word . on board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society s expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic s stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( " steerage " , as it s referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping . although for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose s social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal . the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through . dicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors . his is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations . girls are going to swoon over him . winslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable . the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character s upbringing . simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante . rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting . billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him . his features are such that even when he smiles , there s something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate . he s something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model . like dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well . backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal s personal assistant ( or " man " as they said at the turn of the century ) . no matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match . additionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as " the unsinkable " molly brown , danny nucci as jack s friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie . nice to see dr . bombay getting work . also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die . this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship s crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else . in this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures . you don t just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well . as i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects . the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic . with regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale . cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet . could ve fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless . also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning . we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner . these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion . in all , james cameron s titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action . the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer s attention is held alternately by those three main elements , from the movie s intriguing beginning to it s satisfactory ending . in box office receipts , titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship .

" stillman , who made " metropolitan " and " barcelona " using some of the same actors , uses disco s final hours to highlight what is another conversation-heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director . the young , upwardly-mobile professional ( don t call them yuppies ! ) men and women of " the last days of disco " frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass-pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire , amy grant , and andrea true connection . here they talk and talk and talk , intellectualizing about such things as dating , success , and being liked , accepted , and admired . if talk is cheap , " the last days of disco " must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot . what makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie , harvard-educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit , perception , and style ( including , at one point , a riotously inventive deconstruction of " the lady and the tramp " ) . naïve alice ( chloë sevigny ) and sophisticated charlotte ( kate beckinsale ) are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house . charlotte is confident and outspoken--perhaps a little too outspoken ; alice is shy and introverted , " like a kindergarten teacher . " the two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot , looking good and looking for excitement ( and that ms . beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor ! ) . here they meet , or re-meet , a variety of eligible men , many of whom they knew in college . des ( played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman ) is one of the club s managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back . des has reached a crisis point in his life : he just found out--last wednesday , in fact--that he s gay . whether it s true or not , it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend ( jennifer beals in a small but soul-baring turn ) . charlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth . jimmy ( mackenzie astin ) is the advertising exec who , by the end of the picture , winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain ( visions of " barcelona " ? ) . josh ( matt keeslar ) is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say , just once , " book this clown ! " and robert sean leonard plays another one of alice s revolving suitors ; the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity . any film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book . in fact , the entire ensemble is appealing in that well-spoken stillman way . while the eschewing of " ferocious pairing " is a favored topic of conversation in the film , the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love , lust , and trouble with each other in an emotional merry-go-round that cleverly develops its characters through the " preferred " dynamics of social group interaction . more mature than stillman s previous two films , " the last days of disco " is as consistently droll as it is stimulating . it s a movie you should definitely get on down to .

positiveC,' starring : bill paxton , billy bob thorton , bridget fondai know what i would do with $4 . 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site , especially if i were with jacob and lou . ( huh ? ) well , in any event , that is the situation hank ( paxton ) finds himself in . he and his dim-witted brother jacob ( thorton ) and tubby friend lou ( brent briscoe ) come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck . against his better judgement , hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities . the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret , and is it worth it ? a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things , clay pigeons and even fargo , and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle . oh , and its much better than any of those . sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture . he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do . i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course . one of the film s components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick s the thin red line . in malick s three hour bore-a-thon , he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story . it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass , a small bird , or a flowing body of water . sure , there were obvious metaphorical connections , but there was no subtlty to his efforts . raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters . i think most viewers may miss the comparison , but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film . and then there s billy bob thorton , who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood . if it can continute to produce people like thorton , hollywood will be ok . he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here . it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade , but is is just as complex , if not more so . jacob is slow and simple , and yet we so often see him deep in thought . i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say ( or didn t know how to say ) or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said . here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry . though the plot is somewhat unoriginal , it has a very appealing new twist in its characters . paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group ( a far cry from chet in wierd science ) . perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice-giving wife , but she certainly doesn t do anything ruin the picture . a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un-redeeming . but at least this one has an important message , unlike so many of its counterparts .  stars ©1999 nick amado namado@concentric . net check out my movie reviews at www . writerboy . com/nick ( or i ll come to your house and read all my reviews outloud in miss piggy s voice ) '
positiveC,' 1997 , pg-13 , 119 minutes [1 hour , 59 minutes]starring : pierce brosnon ( james bond ) , jonathon pryce ( elliot carver ) , michelle yeoh ( wai lin ) , teri hatcher ( paris carver ) ; written by bruce feirstien ; produced by barbara broccoli , michael g . wilson ; directed by roger spottiswoode ; based on characters created by ian fleming . seen december 28 , 1997 at 8 : 45 p . m . at the crossgates mall cinema 18 ( guilderland , ny ) , theater #8 , with matt perreault and my sister jena for free ( matt paid using pre-paid passes ) . if there s ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non- stop action , the james bond films are it . and if there s ever been a james bond film that not only proves this , but does so by pushing it to the extreme , " tomorrow never dies " is it . opening sequences almost always make or break action films . when done properly , not only are they actually exciting , but they foreshadow things to come . this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie , but with a sense of the self-aware , enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in . first there s a high-tech , slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly , chinese waters . there s definite tension as there seems to be an unknown , but certainly hostile , third party involved who is manipulating both sides . when the scene ends in tragedy , it s clear there s some kind of powerful conspiracy going on , and who else to call on for such a case but james bond ? the film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond ( brosnon ) . as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious , bond is clearly ( and obviously ) depicted as an out-and-out hero . he single-handedly takes out a small army of terrorists , and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co-pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down ! this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for ( over- ) using , but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly . it s not about the payoff because it s obvious bond will escape , instead , it s the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it , all the while creating for witty , hysterical comedy . it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore , because of political correctness , and just plain copping-out on behalf of the filmmakers ( even the term " villain " sounds passe ) . what the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come , yet making him seem completely plausible . jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant , cunning elliot carver , a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world , that is , through his massive media empire , not through nuclear weapons . through some interesting detective work , bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news . not only is that an original idea for a conflict , but one which could carry over into reality . surprisingly , this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become . the film s hook is the action , and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way . the story works much like bond himself - always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot . somehow a chinese agent , wai lin ( yeoh ) , bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together . the chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid , but also works because of this , not in spite of it . the two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons , yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story . although " tomorrow never dies " is far from perfect , it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue . please visit chad z movie page @ http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz - over 180 new and old films reviewed in depth , not just blind ratings and quick capsules . also , check out the first shay astar web page @ http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz/shayastar . html to receive chad z movie reviews directly , send e-mail to chadpolenz@aol . com with " subscribe plan#_ " in the header ( plan 1 - new releases , plan 2 - all movies reviewed ) .

positiveC,' written by : alex proyas , lem dobbs and david s . goyerstarring : rufus sewell , kiefer sutherland , jennifer connelly , william hurt ingredients : man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder , dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers . synopsis : what if you woke up one day , and suspected you were not on earth , and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers ? in dark city john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) has this problem . dark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery . poor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner . a mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there , and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trench-coats , as well as by the police , and the dogged inspector bumstead ( william hurt ) . is john a murderer , and what can his missing memories tell him ? he searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues . but when the clues don t fit , it doesn t just confuse him ; it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city . to john , something is fishy , and very unreal about this city . how come it s always dark , and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning ? and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city , or how to get to nearby shell beach ? every night , around midnight , john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation , and at this time , creepy alien experimenters known as the  strangers  come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into people s heads with big hypodermic needles . the strangers have the ability to  tune ,   or warp reality using telepathic powers . turns out , the city is not on earth at all . and the reason why john doesn t fall victim to the nightly suspended animation , is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same god-like reality-warping abilities as the strangers . even with the help of scientist dr . daniel schreber , can john take back the dark city ? opinion : director alex proyas ( he also directed the crow ) mentions this in the dark city press kit : in films , science fiction is always " used to have big spaceships blow up cities . i think we re a little tired of that . " according to director proyas , probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers . it s designed so that you can watch the film over again , and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch . it s a philosophical piece . cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens ( whether they be klingons , giant bugs , or proponents of the dark side of the force ) . but science fiction in books reaches beyond the  shoot-em-up  level and targets the big questions , questions like who are we ? what is the human condition ? what is ethical ? what would a true human being do ? far from comic book style on the order of spawn , batman , or the mutant ninja turtles , dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens , but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner . dark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay . a little more than 200 years ago , the world was filled with unhappy peasants - - unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian , military , conformist , medieval regimes . the people took refuge in religion , the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering , but after death , heaven would be available . meanwhile , the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes ; the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven . when science finally overturned religion , the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments . but the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old . this is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud , kant , kafka , nietzsche , and dostoevsky pondered what society should be , and what place the individual had in it . the existentialists  in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile , indifferent , or alienated universe . in dark city , when the last dying , defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens  scientific experiments on the human beings  brains failed , murdoch replies , pointing to his head , " because the human condition isn t located in here .

positiveC,' the always over-the-top underrated don knotts kicked off his first of a string of family films with this delightful comedy with a dash of horror . luther heggs ( knotts ) is a bug-eyed type-setter for the local newspaper , he s always dreamed of becoming a first-class reporter but newspaper manager ollie ( skip homeier ) makes fun of him and won t let him write any stories . luther is driving along when a man is hit over the head in front of the town s spooky old simmons mansion that everyone says is haunted . convinced that they can scare him away from the paper for good , ollie and george beckett ( dick sargent ) decide to let him write a story , what s the catch you ask ? he has to write it about his overnite stay in the simmons house . much to his horror he finds that things go bump in the night , the organ plays by itself , and a pair of garden shears are stabbed in the neck of a bleeding portrait . he writes of his experiences and the town declares him a hero . finding it unsuitable against the family name , nicholas simmons ( philip ober ) challenges luther to prove what he saw . of course , the same things never happen again , and he can t prove the secret passageway that he found . nicholas is trying to bulldoze the house because he wants to cover up the family s secret past . the film is classic knotts , the movie sets him up well and he s wonderful as usual . sadly the film is flawed , most of the character s motivations and thoughts are pretty obvious from the beginning . most non-knotts dialouge is boring and weak . plus , the trailer ( which appears before the movie ) shows almost every second of luther s confrontation in the spooked house . but i am a fan of knotts , where the geeky wide-eyed man gets the girl . the film is funny , but predictable , and not original , so it gets * * * stars .

positiveC,'  directed by robert iscove starring freddie prinze jr . , rachael leigh cook , jodi lyn o keefe , anna paquin , kieran culkin , elden henson , paul walker , kevin pollak , dule hill , usher raymond , matthew lillard , clea duval , lil  kim high school comedies have been pretty rare this decade . while the horror film saw itself revived back to the glory days of the early 80s ( beyond that , actually ) , teen comedies have been absent for most of the 90 s . sure , there was a dazed and confused here and a clueless there , but after that , what are we left with ? national lampoon s senior trip ? can t hardly wait came along last year , and was a deliberate attempt to recapture the 80s spirit , when films like say anything , sixteen candles , and fast times at ridgemont high were opening seemingly every weekend . the problem with can t hardly wait was that it tried too hard . it remembered those great 80s films so much that the line between homage and ripoff was stretched very thin . there were some fine individual moments and it was certainly energetic , but in the end it failed . and considering it s weak box office performance , it seemed like the genre was dead . well , she s all that is perhaps the very film that can revive this genre . the sold out theater i saw t in was very receptive towards the movie and so was i ( albeit for different reasons ) . freddie prinze jr . is zack siler , a guy who is living on top of the world . he is senior class president , an honor student , pretty much runs the school , and has a knockout girlfriend ( o keefe ) to boot . early in the film , everything falls apart . his girlfriend dumps him for brock hudson , star of mtv s the real world . in an attempt to protect his legacy , he bets his friend ( paul walker ) that he can turn any girl in the school into the prom queen . the girl walker picks is laney boggs , a social nothing who wears glasses , eccentric clothes ( to say the least ) , and paints dark and disturbing works in art class . one would think laney would love the chance to get to know zack . one thing i enjoyed about the film , is that she is initially reluctant to spend time with him . she is rightfully suspicious about his motivations , but he convinces her that he wants to learn about art . this may not have been just a line . she takes him to an art show and puts him on the spot . he goes up on stage , and in a wonderful moment of spontaneity improvises an act involving a hacky sack . zach gets a real rush out of the moment . he s never experienced the thrill of a live performance before . outside of the theater , he tells laney she has beautiful eyes and should not wear contacts . this is a key scene , because this is the first time we understand that zach s interest here is more than just winning a bet , and it happens before her transformation . that being said , the big transformation scene is every bit as wonderful as it should be . at it s heart , she s all that is just a traditional romantic comedy . on a broader scale , it deals with themes such as responsibility , choices , and the high school social structure . zach is afraid to decide what college to go to , and he uses his father s agressiveness as an excuse . laney hides her true feelings in her bizaare paintings and uses her father and brother , both of whom she practically takes care of , as an excuse for not having a social life . john hughes usually attacked parents , and presented them as one-dimensional subhumans who had no ability to understand what their children were going through . she s all that takes a different route . it says someone must make their own choices , and take responsibility for themselves , no matter what problems their parents might present . the social structure in high school is the most painful , inhumane , cruel thing for a teenager to go through . both zach and laney begin to understand this . they also learn that it s possible to survive this structure without actually becoming part of it . laney has a line later in the film - " i think the right person is up there " - that pretty much sums up this theme . freddie prinze jr .  s performance is really strong here , as opposed to his bland , wooden performance in i know what you did last summer . at the beginning of the film , he is the typical all-american egotistical jock , proud of his legendary existence . to prinze s credit , zach is never too obnoxious . this is because prinze never overacts . instead , he relies on his natural charisma and allows the material to speak for itself . it s a gamble that pays off because later in the film it allows him to be quite charming . as laney , rachael leigh cook is quite a revelation . like janeane garofalo in the truth about cats and dogs , she is beleivable as someone who could be perceived as an ugly duckling by the majority , eventhough the rest of us know better . she has one particular scene , when she learns of the bet , where she delivers a line of pure uninhibited rage perfectly . there is more to anger than just shouting and cook understands that . together , they have a fabulous chemistry , and every scene between them is absolute y delightful . if she s all that has a flaw , it is in the annoying portrayal of two supporting characters . i very much enjoyed jodi lyn o  keefe s performance in halloween : h20 ( though i didn t enjoy the film ) , but here she seems to be on a mission to steal every single scene she is in . instead of just playing her one-dimensional character as a bitchy snob , o keefe wildly overacts with a repetitive line delivery and bizaare facial expressions . look at jordanna brewster s performance in the faculty for a much better portrayal of a similar character . then there is matthew lillard as brock hudson , the real world star . his performance is fine on it s own i suppose , but it really belongs in a different movie . i think this subplot would ve worked better if o keefe s character got together with one of zach s friends . however , other minor characters are simply wonderful . i admired how the film gives each of them a chance to shine . kevin pollak , as laney s dad , is addicted to watching jeapordy . the fact that he never knows the right answer doesn t prevent him from giving a hilariously wrong one anyways . paul walker s performance is interesting , because he is able to disguise his true intentions several times throughout the film . keiran culkin is amusing as laney s younger brother , and the friendship that develops between him and zach is actually touching . elden henson , as laney s childhood friend , and anna paquin , as zach s sister , also have some very nice moments . lee fleming s script is witty and smart . he doesn t rely on tired cliche s to wrap the film up . a key confrontation is left off screen , and instead just revealed through dialogue . this allows the incident to be funny , instead of horrifically out of place , as it would ve seemed if shown on screen . iscove does a fine job throughout . the film is never boring , and a big dance scene at the prom is quite an exhilarating moment , thanks to some wonderful choreography combined with lively music . she s all that isn t very original on it s surface . it s another retelling of the pygmalion story . but it s execution that matters the most , and iscove , fleming , and the actors execute the material just right . larry mcgillicuddy -

positiveC,'  first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series . i have nothing against it particularly , i just don t happen to watch it . having said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well . for us non-fans , there s nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things . the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c . two proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside . the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien . the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze . we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail . a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas . on a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn t you know it , he turns out to be right . the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse . five people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head . the two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made . their search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to " the truth . " the plot , and " the truth , " are uninspired . i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me . it didn t . the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them . but the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden . it s a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that " truth " too high . if this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring . but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it . the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest . before the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth . the locations are not all computer-generated sets , either . there are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . ) make this fantastic film feel more real . ward russell s cinematography is very good . the overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film s plot . russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding . when the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed . finally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train . i don t know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great . the movie s soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound . in one of the movie s most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees . the visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound . there was no question as to who the movie s stars would be . even so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination . both are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy . there is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship . they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street . there might be some romantic interest , but for now they re more interested in their environs than they are in each other . no single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular . but enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes/ '

" . as it turned out , my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy . robert zemeckis , back from the euphoria created by his last film , forrest gump , once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit . don t get me wrong , contact is sci-fibut with a definite difference . based on the late carl sagan novel of the same name , the story delves itself in questions on science and god ; fact and faith . allie ( foster ) is a radio astronomer . she spends her time listening to the stars , via ultra-huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system . her passion for `long-distance communication  is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham-radio system ( a hobbyist radio communication device ) which her late-father bought for her . a scene which particularly strengthens the audiences  view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late-mother through the ham-radio system in which her father replied " not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that , now " . allie s research is based on the seti project ( search for extra terrestrial intelligence ) , in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation . her work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government , which considers it a waste of taxpayer s money and politically unviable , her supervisor ( tom skerritt ) pulls the plug on seti . undaunted , allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers  and eventually found funding from a large private corporation . the following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day , she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound-wave . the news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers , cultist , the media and of course , the government . the situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission . as the world join forces to build this transport , allie is desperate to be the one to go . she enrols herself among a few hopefuls , to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation . her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president s spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning . at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president s spiritual advisor . a strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey . from the very first meeting scene , it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects , foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith , hope and the power of the unseen . the meeting of their worlds , added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless . many people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous , but by actually immersing yourself in it , gives you an entirely different perspective ; one which is free from bias and pre-conceptions . zemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film . contact works by not delving in controversy but rather , touches the thinking audience , urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith ; whether one can actually find compromise within . i consider contact as one of the must-sees for this year .

positiveC,' " face/off " is the story of sean archer ( john travolta ) , a member of an elite secret fbi team attempting to hunt down and catch castor troy ( nicholas cage ) , one really vile and over the top terrorist ( of course , who isn t in today s action movies ) . in the opening of the movie we watch as sean gets nailed from castor troy with a sniper s bullet . unfortunately , while sean barely survives the attack , his son doesn t , and thus sets sean on a life-long pursuit after the evil castor . normal action movie right ? wrong . flashy action director john woo ( somewhat unsuccessfully ) throws the audience a curveball . to better infiltrate castor s crime syndicate , mainly in attempt to stop a bomb going off in the middle of la , sean uses " modern day technology " . what technology you ask ? it s not just rubber noses : sean literally exchanges his own face with the face of castor ( who at this point has been brought into justice and is resting peacefully in a coma ) . sound moderately corny ? it is , and no matter how many special effects john woo brings into the mix , the switch still seems awkward to me . while this is in some ways a pitfall of the movie , fortunately it turns around to make the movie more enjoyable . as suspected , castor gets out of the coma , and takes the original face of sean archer . thus for the majority of the movie , you have literal role reversals , sean appears to be castor , and vice versa . more importantly however , the audience gets to see john travolta acting like the wild nicholas cage we ve come to love , and cage play the more straight-shooting travolta . you can see the actors are having a good time in their roles , and the actors play wonderfully off each other . now the real question : how s the action ? fortunately , it s the other major strength of the movie , with incredibly original sequences , from speed boats to planes on runways . john woo is a master at this art , and succeeds in creating exciting and invigorating shoot outs . on that same note however , i was disappointed in that what i believed to be the best action sequence - where sean is attempting to intercept castor at the airport - is the first sequence of the movie ! consequently , while the movie opened with a bang , i was a little let down by the remaining action sequences . and on a minor point , while most of the slow motion touches are nice , mr . woo seems to be a little too obsessed with this movie making quality . all in all , if you allow yourself to be wrapped up in face/off s vortex , you may look back at a few parts ( the face swapping scene comes instantly to my mind ) with skepticism , but you ll certainly enjoy the two hour ride .

positiveC,' takeshi kitano is truly the " king of all media " in japan , where he has conquered the worlds of film , television , radio , newspapers , even stand-up comedy . however , if american audiences know him at all , it is likely for his villainous role in the putrid cyberthriller johnny mnemonic . that could all change with the near-simultaneous stateside launches of two of his writing-directing-editing-acting efforts , sonatine and fireworks ( hana-bi ) . notice i wrote " could " instead of " will " or " should , " because kitano s poetic , meditative brand of filmmaking will probably be as difficult for most mainstream audiences to sit through as it is to describe ( at the showing of sonatine i attended , there were more than a handful of walkouts ) . these two films fit squarely within a genre ( in both of these cases , crime thriller ) , yet they are made in a stylized , lyrical style more befitting of avant-garde arthouse fare . the resulting works are slow and somewhat difficult , but they prove to be rewarding sits for the more open-minded viewer . in 1993 s sonatine , kitano ( billed under his acting moniker "  beat  takeshi " ) plays an aging small-time gangster dispatched by his boss to go to okinawa to help resolve a turf conflict . after an ambush , a double-cross is clearly afoot , and he and his crew of rather immature young men retreat to a seaside cabin . it is during this section that most people departed the auditorium , but it s not for the reasons one may think . although there are brief bursts of bloody violence interspersed throughout the film , what ( for lack of a better word ) " offended " was the attention to behavior that would normally be deemed too trivial to be shown onscreen . kitano spends plenty of time focusing on what these men do to keep themselves from complete boredom , such as staging mock sumo wrestling matches . it sounds kind of boring on the page ( and , apparently for some it s boring on screen as well ) , but the quirky humor of these scenes give what could easily be a tired story an unusual air of freshness and humanity . as expertly made as it is , what i found lacking in sonatine was any emotional connection , which diminished the power of the finale . the same cannot be said of kitano s most recent effort , fireworks ( hana-bi ) . in this film , kitano , in a nearly silent role , plays a former cop who takes his terminally ill wife ( kayoko kishimoto ) on an extended road trip ; at the same time , police tail him for a bank robbery he made in order to pay off a mob loan shark . much like sonatine , the film moves at a leisurely pace ; there are brief , unsettling bursts of violence ; and laughs are derived from quirky situations and behavior . but fireworks is more richly satifying to the emotions and the senses . serving as a counterpoint to the main plot is the story is of a crippled former partner ( ren osugi ) who searches for meaning through painting . his paintings ( which , not so surprisingly , are actually painted by kitano himself ) are extensively viewed in haunting wordless sequences , which provide the film with a stunning visual framework that grows increasingly ominous as the quietly poignant conclusion draws near . it is unlikely that the films of takeshi kitano will be as widely embraced by american viewers as those of hong kong directors . but in sonatine and fireworks , kitano proves to be a gifted cinematic visionary whose truly unique work deserves stateside recognition , even if that recognition comes from a fairly limited , though highly appreciative , audience .

positiveC,' the people of david riker s the city ( la ciudad ) are easily recognizable : poor destitute mexican immigrants living in listless boroughs of new york city . and the director s careful , patient examination of their incessant , daily struggle to survive by taking any job they can get constitutes most of what the film is about . the city is comprised of four short vignettes , all very poetic in their open-endedness . in the first one , bricks , a group of mexican laborers is taken to the field of nearly ruined buildings . they are left in the middle of nowhere and promised 50 dollars a day for cleaning up bricks . when the ruins of a demolished building collapse and kill one of the workers , the rest can t even explain to the ambulance where they are . home , the second story , offers another look at the immigrant dilemma . a young man , francisco , while searching for his distant relatives , stumbles into a party and ponders about his choice of coming to america to a woman he meets . he doesn t know anyone in the city and all his possessions fit in one bag he carries with him . the moment of comfort he obtains by sharing his sorrows with a woman from his native town in mexico is fleeting -- he is lost on his way from a grocery store back to her apartment . the protagonist of the puppeteer is a loving father , who lives with his daughter in a car and survives by performing puppet shows to the local kids in the neighborhood . they watch the moon at night while the father reads fairy tales to his daughter , hoping that some day she will be able to go to school with the other kids . she won t , as it turns out , because he can t provide a receipt proving that his daughter lives in the city . the final and the most desolate is the story of seamstress , a woman who comes to america to earn money for the family she left behind . she is devastated to find out that her daughter is sick , but , as in the previous three tales , her situation is hopeless : the sweatshop owners keep promising to pay , but it s obvious that the woman , as well as the other desperate workers , will not get a cent for their labor . the stories of this spare , reserved documentary-like black-and-white film give face to the faceless , to those aspects of urban and , most importantly , human experience we usually avert our eyes from . riker turns to traditions of italian neorealism , a genre whose premise was to bring real people and contemporary social problems into focus . like most films of that era , the city expresses no hopes for deep social change and is thus an incredibly inert film . it is authentic , somber and tragic , and the poverty it depicts could have been captured anywhere in the world . the fatalism that pervades the lives of riker s characters calls for a depressing conclusion : that nothing will ever change for these people . when a seamstress demands to be paid , other workers stop working and stare at her breakdown in the agonizing silence . not being paid for weeks , without any security in their lives , will they express solidarity with her ? probably not . david riker does nothing to pull your heartstrings , which is why the film is so honest and devastating . but it is the absence of any kind of inner force in the film that disturbs me more than its morbid subject matter . i remember john huston s fat city , about two fighters from stockton : one is aging and paunchy , who had his moment of glory but whose next stop is skid row ; his young counterpart has chosen the same fate , despite the living lesson before his eyes . stockton is not new york -- no one in their right mind will ever go there , and fat city isn t about immigrants , but about failure and poverty . it is a brutal and bleak picture , but the way huston depicts his characters is dramatically different from riker : it is a film about people who are beaten before they start , but who never stop fighting . their despair has the smell of liquor , unmade beds , and cheap hotels , but they obstinately bounce back and refuse to take defeat for granted . it is perhaps the passivity of la ciudad , both in content and style , that makes this film a bittersweet disappointment .

positiveC,' if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia . although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle s high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones . until that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters . contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times . one of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin s to live and die in l . a . the money isn t just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot . rick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected . richard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters . however , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another . finally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money . being frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier . their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway . like french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin s movie was inspired by real life . gerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent . that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood . secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie s hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan s speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times . ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie . willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn t seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable . compared with him , and all the other side characters that want their " piece of the action " , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers . instead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those " better judgement " is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end . in such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn t seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) . the dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin s directing skills . the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase . that scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film . the soundtrack , provided by now almost forgotten band " wang chung " , is also one of the more memorable of that decade . in every case , to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it .

" wonderland " is glorious proof of that , a film of scruffy beauty and spellbinding power , which seems constructed to capture the appeal of eavesdropping . that pastime is involving , of course , because of our instinctive fascination with humanity ; this movie uses the same hook , diving into the lives of several londoners , all of whom are connected by family ties , but are at different stages of their lives and have different occupations . nadia ( gina mckee ) is an attractive but lonely waitress , who places a lot of personal ads but allows herself to get upset every time she goes on a date . one of her sisters , molly ( molly parker ) , is married and pregnant ; the other , debbie ( shirley henderson ) , is raising her son alone . their parents are eileen ( kika markham ) and bill ( jack shepherd ) , two pathetically unhappy people who mope around the house , and occasionally cringe ; because of barking dogs , broken appliances , boredom or simple fear of leaving the house . we also meet up with partners and ex-partners , friends , acquaintances , neighbours , estranged relatives , colleagues . . . " wonderland " never announces itself as a definite study of anything in particular , which gives it the freedom to roam around , to spy on whomever s interesting . the director , michael winterbottom , shoots everything in a grainy , hand-held , almost camcorder style which makes events seem imparted to us from the inside out , rather than staged and shot . it s as if invisible camera crews had been ceaselessly exploring london . it s essential to the sense that we re watching real people who aren t aware of our presence . this could have come across as solemn and grimy , like any of those pathetic tv documentaries that follow losers around their places of work and play . but in between the quiet , sober scenes are astounding sequences where the camera submerges in neon light , the editing plays around with cutting and speed , and michael nyman s grand score soars on the soundtrack . the whole movie uses london as a backdrop , letting us unconsciously absorb it ; these grand musical moments explicitly rejoice in the city s strange beauty , and announce that the film is not scrutinising life , but gazing at it in wonderment . so music is an important tone-setter in " wonderland " -- but it s always kept for these side-moments , and never interferes with the drama . scenes do not follow typical hollywood constructions ; there isn t a little climax every five minutes , characters don t subtly recap their situations to each other to let the audience know what s going on . everything plays out at a realistic pace , and we get our bearings by picking up on mood , tone , emotions . winterbottom , his actors , and even his extras , have a knack for capturing the way conversational rhythms actually do sound -- in homes , hairdressers  shops and pubs ; on dates , the phone , and everywhere else the story goes . and that is why this beautiful film has been made . it is a devoted record of modern human behaviour . i dreaded that there would be some hugely inappropriate surprise plot development near the ending , but no -- winterbottom and screenwriter laurence cordiat know that most of us don t end a typical weekend by stumbling into life-changing experiences . " wonderland " is such an acute observance of people that it makes us confront our essential feelings about our fellow man . and to any foreigners out there , wondering what it s like to be in britain -- just take a look at this movie . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantganiplease visit , and encourage others to visit , the uk critic s website , which is located at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic '
positiveC,' as antiquated as the formula is , i m surprised hollywood keeps it around : wife cheats on abusive spouse and , instead of leaving him , convinces her lover to kill him so they can be together and get all his money . or , roles can be switched and jealous husband can be the one doing the plotting . as is the case with murder , nicely conceived and gamely acted . douglas plays a businessman , steven taylor . his business is about to go bankrupt . his wife , emily ( paltrow ) , is having an affair with a painter across town , named david ( the expressionless mortensen ) . they plan to let steven in on it - she more than he : " it s not fair to him " . but , steven is no dupe . though , how he knows , or even suspects , enough to have the two photographed during an afternoon rendezvous , is never explained . standard stuff . but , the movie has smart , thinking individuals . like douglas , who has his plan to do away with his wife down to how and why to do what with keys . and , mortensen - a scamster - who agrees to do the " wet work " , but has plans , also . every detail of the murder plot , and the complications that inevitably arise , seems to be coherent and logical , and it s kind of fun watching the genre played out intelligently for once . i liked someof the physical acting between paltrow and mortensen , as during an art exhibition where he sees her , starts walking toward her and she inconspicuously waves him off . then , once they ve met in the corner , and douglas comes upon them , they act completely natural and never give any sort of nervous reaction that maybe he knows . and i liked the way douglas seemed to have everything figured out , and together . he s able to verbally explain his motives with well- chosen words . i like dialogue where people come at the subject of discussion from not just one angle , but think a situation through , think about every possibility . murder has that kind of banter . i just wish the film had been about more . i kept waiting for it to ask questions movies like this never ask . for instance , why does the paltrow character keep saying it s not fair to her husband to keep her affair a secret ? as if she s concerned about how he feels . i m wondering why she would ve had the affair in the first place , and not worry about how it may or may not affect him , and why it would only hit her a good ways into the affair to at least let him know about it . does she love her husband ? people don t usually get married otherwise , right ? and if she does love him , how much or how little that she can t try and work things out ? or , _has_ she tried ? does she care about whether or not she has hurt him , or that she ll hurt him again ? steven doesn t seem like such a bad guy ( of course , he _is_ , but that s only later on ) . he s rich . he likes being rich , gives him a certain air of superiority ( at one point he tells paltrow which dress to wear - so , you know he s a real creep ) . maybe he makes her feel small , and insecure , but has it always been that way ? how did it _get_ that way ? also , there s no tangible chemistry between paltrow and mortensen , furthering my question into why-is-she-with-either- man territory . the same goes for douglas  character . he has multiple reasons for wanting his wife dead , not just the obvious ( which , come to think , isn t really a reason at all , considering what he s most worried with ) . but , why is he married to her ? it s an inconsequential line of inquiry in the end , i guess , but wouldn t answering such questions - or even addressing them - give the film a little more dramatic depth ? of course , that would make a longer movie . but hey , attention spans do exist . and why , oh why , do they have to revert to a violent ending ? i saw a movie once called , i believe , lady beware . it starred diane lane . the storyline wasn t quite the same , but it , too , could have ended in a violent way . instead , it chose a more subtle approach that was much , much more effective . a perfect murder deserved one of those , because it has a lot going for it already . -r- '

" in the film , newman plays henry manning , a former bank robber who plans to break out of prison by faking a stroke . when he is transferred to a minimum-security nursing home , he thinks he s home free . however , the woman assigned to take care of him , carol ann mckay ( linda fiorentino - men in black ) suspects that he s a fake and attempts to lure him out of his trance so he will help her in a burglary with her and her husband wayne ( dermot mulroney - copycat , my best friend s wedding ) . she goes to some outrageous lengths to keep him from playing possum , but when she finally awakes the bank robbing legend , she faces a challenge that could change her life . nothing against linda fiorentino , who does a fine job in this movie , but she has no extraordinary talents that allow her to become a stand-out criminal worthy of newman s tutelage . also , her husband wayne proves to be a clumsy ox despite his prowess on the football field and the " cool head " that his wife constantly brags about . as newman states in one of his first lines , " it s amateur hour , " and unfortunately this is the sad truth for this movie . though the far-fetched plot and lack of support diminish newman s shining star , the movie isn t a complete failure . it offers some good laughs and a few vintage newman moments , like his dance with fiorentino , where he manages to change her life in one song and a two-step .

" can t i have a glove , sir ? " he asks . " no , " gates replies , " that s how the chain of command works . " gates and vig consult two reliable young comrades , muscle-bound family man sergeant troy barlow ( mark wahlberg ) and firm , shrewd staff sergeant chief elgin ( ice cube ) . together the quintet deduce the location of the loot to be an iraqi army bunker near cordoba , and guess that it will be several million dollars worth of kuwaiti gold bullion . their plan : to steal it . if they get caught : they ll say they were on a legitimate mission to rescue their allies  property from the enemy . since we never see movie characters plan heists and then follow them through without a hitch , we know this scheme will somehow go wrong . our heroes  obstacle comes when they re about to leave the village in which the gold-filled bunker is situated . iraqi guards are making clear they plan to harm civilians , and it would be wrong to leave them to do so . there is a scene of agonising effectiveness here , as the action goes into slow motion to mark the cease-fire s dissolution into chaos . a mother is shot in full view of her husband and children . soldiers resume fighting . watching this at a delayed pace accentuates the tension , the horror , and the reality of each bullet , and all we can do is sit there , watching , feeling helpless . of course , that s all the american soldiers can do for most of the time . george bush may have urged iraqi citizens to rise up against saddam hussein s evil regime , but he s not letting his troops help them , because the gulf war wasn t about liberating people , and was fought to make sure kuwait could keep supplying oil to the western world . most people already realise and are resigned to that , but " three kings " angrily indicts bush for it , with a second half that is dramatic and political . the film surrounds gates , vig , barlow and elgin with hypocrisy and devastation as they attempt to get back to their base , fight off hostile fire , save the lives of refugees and salvage some bullion . that s a little anticlimactic , as the opening chapters are full of brilliantly crude slapstick satire , and at times thereafter the film becomes inappropriately slowed down when accommodating its serious stuff . russell , who wrote and directed , should have found some way to blend the different elements in less jarring fashion . it is creative to follow an elaborate practical gag about pretending to be saddam with realistic footage of refugee orphans , but it isn t necessarily wise , because it means the audience is still laughing when we should be settling down for sober thought . what " three kings " conveys brilliantly , throughout everything light and heavy , is the utter confusion of war -- in the opening words ( " are we still shooting ? " ) , the disorganisation of the u . s . forces  barracks , and the mad dash to safety the film spends most of its time on . we can decipher what s going on during immediate moments , but the general experience is intentionally perplexing and dizzying . ambiguous individual point of view shots contribute to this , as does unstable , screw-loose pacing . newton thomas sigel s cinematography is the most crucial element in putting us in the middle of the unpredictability . in the tradition of a lot of recent hollywood war dramas , it s shaky and grainy , but its underdeveloped film stock is a much more original touch , making the frame extremely sensitive to light . there are huge contrast changes all the time , and the film seems to be reacting to situations , and seeing images , rather than creating them . the four main actors work subtle wonders , too , performing in ways that balance each other s efforts nicely . clooney has authoritative star power ; jonze , who has also done good work as a director , is pleasing in what is essentially a jester role ; wahlberg is charming and boyish ; cube reassures us that there s someone sensible in this motley crew . as of yet , the only other theatrical motion picture dealing with the gulf war has been edward zwick s " courage under fire " , from 1996 . so it s amazing , when you think about it , that russell has so soon found the courage to make a bizarre comedic commentary on the subject . shame on warner bros for marketing it as a dumb action flick , in ads that juxtapose serious-sounding lines with explosions . they re shooting themselves in the foot , as fans of that sort of thing will be put off when they learn what the movie is actually about , and most other people will the alienated by the commercials .

positiveC,' in trying to give proper praise to american pie , the drop-dead funniest film of 1999 , i compare it to other recent teen comedies , like can¹t hardly wait and she¹s all that . movies which have zero ambition , go for the cheap , easy laugh and nothing more , and dare not delve into the intricacies of what adolescent sexual confusion might actually entail . movies concerned with plot contrivance ( will the geeky guy get the prom queen ; will the girl be able to figure out a devious bet against her , in time to fall in love ) , and nothing that has to do with real life . american pie puts them right in their place , with honesty and unparalleled situational humor - embarrassing and rude as it may be . simply put , this movie rocks . not about anything in particular , pie focuses on a group of high school guys who , three weeks before graduation , vow to lose their virginity as of prom night , out of dignity if nothing else ; because , " it¹s tradition . like the rose bowl . " oz ( or nova , played by a marvelous chris klein ) starts off the cliché misogynist pig jock , but then joins the school choir , in hopes of wooing the pretty heather ( mena suvari ) , only to realize his sensitive side . kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) already has a girlfriend , vicky ( the sexy tara reid ) , but she¹s holding out for just the right time to consummate their relationship ; " it¹s not a space shuttle launch . it¹s sex "  love that line . jim ( a break-through jason biggs ) has a slight crush on foreign exchange student nadia , but faces more complicated issues with masturbation , mainly on the homefront , to wonderful comic result ; the uncomfortable discussions with his father ( a sly eugene levy ) , about the birds and bees , are perfect gems of comic timing . will they succeed in getting laid ? no matter . what makes american pie great is its intrinsic sweetness . even the narrow-minded stifler ( seann w . scott ) , who accidentally drinks " pale ale " , has a core of innocence ­ albeit , buried far beneath an abrasive exterior . perverted and lewd , at times , the film remains not mean or bitter in the least . you want these guys and girls to find happiness , or as much as one can reasonably expect to find at that age . every character is thoroughly likeable , which is kind of rare in a film like this . i think , again , back to can¹t hardly wait , from earlier this year , in which just about every one of the characters was immature and selfish , and compare it to american pie , full of real and genuine people experiencing more truthful trials of growing up . there isn¹t a comparison to be made , really . i like the way kevin goes the distance to please vicky , and their exploration of sexual satisfaction ; you don¹t see many teen comedies where both the male and female party concentrates respective attention on the other¹s personal gratification . i also found oz¹s slow progression into true romantic kind of endearing . and , not to be overlooked , is the film¹s overt raunch . i laughed my ass off during finche¹s ( eddie kay thomas ) bout with uncontrollable diarrhea in the girl¹s bathroom . jim copulating with the titular centerpiece comes in a close second . and , i especially love alyson hannigan¹s ( doing her willow bit ) band dork , who gets the two biggest guffaws during the concluding post-prom party . the film originally garnered an nc-17 rating for its full-bore graphic content , but all that does is minimize the heart of american pie - a true-blue coming of age tale . the script , by adam herz , is audacious and perceptive , while at the same time smart and sophisticated and surprisingly gentle . the actors are amicable and seem to be having a good time . if the movie falters , it¹s by ending on such a feel-good note . by then , it makes no real difference , however , as american pie has proved itself a raucous hit . go !

positiveC,' walking into " ready to rumble " , the new film from hollywood s biggest goofball , david arquette ( " scream " , those annoying 1-800-call-att commercials ) , i figured there were two possibilities for this movie . it was going to be stupid , the previews had already given that much away . the question now , was whether it was going to be the sort of stupid which you can t help but chuckle at , or the just plain moronic kind . it turns out that the movie has a little of both . while there are a lot of faults , there are also one or two really funny scenes and a few others you can t help but find amusing no matter how low brow they might be . however , the film s biggest problem is the premise itself . how can one make a movie that pokes fun at professional wrestling when wrestling already pokes fun at itself ? gordie ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) have only one great love in their lives . this all consuming passion is professional wrestling , and specifically worship for their idol , jimmy " the king " king ( oliver platt ) . they have just obtained tickets to the latest match between the king and diamond dallas page ( page falkinburg ) . they are horrified to find that king s manager , titus sinclair ( joe pantoliano ) , has rigged the match so that king will not only lose , but will be ejected from the wrestling circuit forever . now gordie and sean have only one purpose in life : to get the king his crown back . however , they soon discover that their idol may not be all they thought he was , and professional wrestling may be * gasp * fake afterall ! when i said there are one or two really funny scenes in this movie i wasn t kidding . fortunately , there are enough mildly amusing scenes to make up for this . the interesting thing is that , the best part of this movie isn t the comedy , it s the massive wrestling match at the film s end . the problem with this is that it s a long , and at times very dull , trip to that payoff . another problem is that while the majority of the jokes may fall flat , at least the actors are trying their best to pull something out of them . however , at other times the movie seems to be trying to convey some message about wrestlers and their fans and this not only doesn t work , but seriously detracts from the rest of the film . i suppose this is because anything serious seems completely out of place in a movie this goofy . as for the actors , i ve never really cared for david arquette . he may have been somewhat entertaining in the " scream " films , but i think this is because wes craven kept him tightly reined in . otherwise , he has a tendancy to overact to the point where the audience expects him to rip out of the screen and start bouncing off the walls . scott caan ( " boiler room " , " black and white " ) hasn t appeared in much till now , but he turns in a remarkably restrained performance considering his co-star . as for oliver platt ( " lake placid " ) , whom i consider one of the better comic actors working in hollywood , he is woefully miscast as a professional wrestler . the problem is , platt is not particularly tall , rather overweight , and about as vicious looking as a small dog . being surrounded by real wrestlers , like bill goldberg throughout the movie , only makes him look more ridiculous in this role . " ready to rumble " has a typical soundtrack for this type of movie . it s filled with popular alternative music , and it was certainly a welcome change from the constant rap soundtracks i ve been hearing lately . brian robbins ( " varsity blues " ) doesn t exactly seem to be directing this movie . he simply seems to be allowing the actors to do whatever they feel like to try and get a laugh out of stephen brill s ( " the mighty ducks " ) rather weak script . i m not sure if this was a good idea , but keeping david arquette under control certainly couldn t have hurt the film . " ready to rumble " runs far too long at 122 minutes , and should have been no more than 95 . i d recommend " ready to rumble " to wrestling fans since they will most likely recognize a few familiar faces and give it three out of five stars . comments ? feel free to e-mail them to : johnbeachem@dependentfilms . net for past reviews , movie news , and other fun stuff , visit : http : //www . dependentfilms . net * * * * * - one of the greatest movies ever made , see it now . * * * * - great flick , try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie , hits and misses . * * - pretty bad , see it only if you have nothing better to do . * - one of the worst movies ever made . see it only if you enjoy pain .

positiveC,' starring liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , jake lloyd , natalie portman , samuel l . jackson . rated pg . the event of events is upon us . people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . i don t think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . anyone who tells you " it s just a movie " is either lying or clueless . it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . but that does not mean that the film itself is bad . in fact , it is terrific . i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as " the force " ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie s real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . he is an innocent slave boy , but " the force is strong with him " so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . as any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor s movie . around 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . he s essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like " exqueeze me ? " and " mesa go now , okeday ? " , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn t already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term " popcorn movie " . what made me surrender and give this movie  stars was the score by john williams . even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . when you see " a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away " , when the familiar music plays , when the words " star wars " appear on screen , you ll feel a tingle even if you didn t see the movie when it first came out in  77 . it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . we not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we re seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . the phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . it works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia . ©1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; --== sent via deja . com http : //www . deja . com/ ==-- ---share what you know . learn what you don t . --- '
positiveC,' with stars like sigourney weaver ( " alien " trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc . ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot . sadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller . helen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr . ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak . incidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes . a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco . detective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first . copycat " borrows " a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work . but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . . much of the time wasted could ve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama . even so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . . weaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) . harry connick jr . , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter . which comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please . . . ) . copycat is a good thriller . although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move . this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts . nice movie to bring your girlfriend to . . . .

positiveC,' corey yuen s latest film , " hero " is notable on two fronts . first this is the film to bring back the shaw brothers studio back to the forefront of film production . secondly , the film is the re-discovery of yuen biao . the film opens around the end of the qin dynasty , when many immigrants were making their way to shanghai . poverty and crime rule most of china . a young man , ma wing jing and his brother enter the fabled city and become laborers at the pier . tam see is the most powerful gangster in town , having control of the center of the city and having an alliance with the british army . wing jing and see become friends during a confrontation . their friendship grows as both men start to realize their dreams , wing jing s to be a powerful and wealthy man , and see to settle down with a woman he can truly love . wing jing meets the singer at the club ( jessica hester ) and falls in love with her , not realizing that she is the star attraction . after stealing her picture from a display , wing jing and his brother plot to impress her . first they rob two foreigner s of their money and cloths , and set up a midnight rendezvous . unfortunately , wing jing has run afoul of a rival gangster , yeung seung who has bribed the police in an effort to gain control of see s night club . the two bothers are arrested and held until they manage to escape just before dawn . jessica , having waited outside in the cold with her manager all night , gives up and returns home . see decides to retire , he gives the night club to wing jing , as repayment for saving his life during an attempted murder . see arranges the trade and ask his lover ( valerie chow ) to take care of wing jing . unfortunately , she has sided with yeung seung . the performances in the film are all top notch , with fine turns by takeshi kaneshiro as ma wing jing and jessica hester and valerie chow . the comic turn by yuen wah , previously known as the mad vietnamese in samo hung s " eastern condors " , is a marvelous surprise . his gift for comedy is marvelously understated and hilarious . the stand-out is by yuen biao who returns to the screen after a string of disappointments , with a stellar performance . his tam see is a triad boss who knows that his time is coming to an end but still has the cunning and craft to uphold his pride . his gangster is almost non-violent , in that he only retaliates , never instigates violence . but when the time comes to fight , yuen biao has never looked better . corey yuen directs the film with a maturity and a sense of pacing that has been lacking in hong kong movies as of late . the lighting , cinematography and staging of the film are beautiful to watch . the action scenes do not disappoint either . this is the most aggressive and inventive martial art choreography i ve seen in some time , actually surpassing jackie chan s work in both  rumble in the bronx  and  first strike  . the special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job of making the impossible look possible . an early fight between takeshi kaneshiro and yuen biao on the back of a horse is to be seen to be believed . also noteworthy is the score for the film , done in a marvelously lush orchestral style , not representative of most hong kong fare . i would dare to say it ranks as high as the scores for both " titanic " and " rosewood " as best of the year . all in all , " hero " marks a grand return to filmmaking for shaw brothers . this is the film that gives us faith that hong kong cinema is alive and flourishing .

positiveC,' trekkies , roger nygard s energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions . the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike . ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs . trekker polemic as not worth arguing about . ) the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe . denise crosby , who played tasha yar on " star trek : the next generation , " serves as the host . in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) . ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the " new yorker " as the first recorded usage of the word . ) unless you ve been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans . one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate . others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of . my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams . arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do . her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well . " every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , " she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession . she doesn t quite understand all of the uproar . " i m an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , " she reminds us . her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith . along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty . and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment . few other avocations could give this much satisfaction . these people are having the time of their lives . ( for the record , i m not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies . ) the film interviews the various star trek series s stars as well as its fans . the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong . filled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions . at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel . after appearing briefly , he drank some water and left . they decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the " q virus . " the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too . with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity . not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies . one guy is a trekkie cross-dresser , another dresses her cat , and then there is the dentist . the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set . he , his oral hygienists , his receptionist , his wife , and his kids wear the outfits all of the time . it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home , but not his family . for variety , he and his family do change characters from time to time . he says his patients like it . well , there was this one complainer , but he had a problem with his bill anyway . there are summer schools for klingon with ph . d . linguists to teach the language . hamlet is now available in klingon , albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore , and they are working on translating the bible . they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs , even u . s . customs . the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series s larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns . sandwiched in-between the levity , the switch in tone doesn t work . the incessantly up-beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator . he fits right in . trekkies runs a breezy 1 : 26 . it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages .

positiveC,' tomorrow never dies  -a review by chambers , bill chambers ( what movie do you recommend ? cast your opinion on my updated website , film freak central : http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/set/7504 ) starring pierce brosnan , michelle yeoh , jonathan pryce , teri hatcher written by bruce fierstein directed by roger spottiswoode let s face it : the $100 million-plus smash that was " goldeneye " was not a good film by any means , and as a bond movie was only marginally better than , say , " a view to a kill " or either of the timothy dalton pictures , by virtue of nice pacing . but it did revive the series , and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie . the new " m " is a woman ) . " tomorrow never dies " is the picture " goldeneye " should have been ; it s also the most entertaining bond outing since " the spy who loved me " . the new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine . as an attack occurs , the front-page headline is already being prepared , courtesy of carver media . carver ( pryce ) the man is a deluded magnate , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gates , and peter sellars  german scientist from " dr . strangelove " ( physically , pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days ) . it s up to james bond to take him down , with assistance , of course , from a wealth of gadgets ( including a multi-purpose cell phone ) , and beautiful women . enter michelle yeoh , fresh from " supercop " , as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgles , dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta , and refuses the advances of our philandering hero . they make a great team . " tomorrow never dies " is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film , given that at the helm is none other than the director of " turner & hooch " . spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces , each much more intricate and impressive than , for instance , the tank scene in " goldeneye " . moreover , brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders , and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language . returned in brosnan s eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv s " remington steele " , as has his deadpan wit . and though carver s motives are muddy ( when carver explains that " genius is insanity with some success " , screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut ) , pryce makes an agreeable , memorable villain . in the future , they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures . there a few too many explosions in " tomorrow never dies " , perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue . and it could have used a sharper script , though i was amused by the double entendres , none of which i will reveal here . as it stands , the plot suffers many holes ( i m not taking about implausibilities ) , and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed . now that the elements are in place : modern special effects and stunt work , cool pierce brosnan , kickass female allies . . . it s time to put them to use in something truly special . there s no mistaking , however , that " tomorrow never dies " is ideal holiday escapism , and for the first time in perhaps years , you ll walk out wanting more bond movies . -reviewed december 17 , 1997 '
positiveC,' ( 1996 ) starring jennifer jason leigh , ron eldard , glenne headley , lyle lovett , jena malone , dermot mulroney , christina ricci screenplay by anne meredith , based on the book by dorothy allison produced by amanda digiulio directed by anjelica huston running time : 97 minutes for more than a decade , anjelica huston has been one of america s finest actresses . in her directorial debut , bastard out of carolina , based upon dorothy allison s largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south , huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well . the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright , nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth , in post-world war ii south carolina . through voice-over ( narration done by laura dern ) , we find that she nearly didn t survive birth , as her single mother anney , played by jennifer jason leigh , was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident . that s just the beginning of her troubles . bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate , a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come . anney meets and weds lyle , a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident . anney s brother earle , played by michael rooker , introduces her to glen , played by ron eldard , a co-worker at the mill . glen , the black sheep of a wealthy family ( " when are you gonna make your daddy proud ? i ll tell you when - never ! " he s told ) and filled with bitterness , courts anney and eventually wins her , despite warnings of a violent temper . when anney miscarries with his much-prized baby boy , glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone , beating and abusing her , while the love-dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour . things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment . while set several decades ago , this story remains completely relevant in today s society , where abused wives return to their husbands , and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other . the real star of this domestic drama is not top-billed jennifer jason leigh , but child actress jena malone , who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance . her work is of award-calibre , and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natalie portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malone s performance stands up well . leigh s performance in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she s not really given much to do , and ron eldard work is very solid , skillfully manouvering his character s moods in and out of explosive rage . one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure-cooker ticking away . of the supporting cast , special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker s performance . there s a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste , from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms , to the familiar sight of a dried-up uptight wise old granny ( played by grace zabriskie ) sitting on the porch rocking chair , to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance . still , it cannot be denied that anne meredith s screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power . huston s direction of the film is surehanded and impressive , giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast , particularly the young malone . her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard-hitting emotional , rather than graphic , manner , and are very effective . huston s talent with camera positioning is wonderful , from a visually striking shot done through a fan , to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile . the film has the toned-down feel of a television production ; bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station , who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience . perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant , but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing .

positiveC,' titantic , writer and director james cameron s much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful . if you ve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again . the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world s most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers . in either case , it is filmmaking at its best . when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long . he said no but that the time would go by so fast she d never notice the length . amazingly , he was right . titanic is one of the few long films that doesn t suffer because of it . the lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean . fortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world s most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as " the ship of dreams . " the necklace s hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story . although almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk . using a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing . after twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage . in a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast . the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing . entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane . and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class . even with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes . in contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board . after jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair . never tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story . leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma . in so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part . when he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal s supercilious put-downs . kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose . the chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what s eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing . from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship s bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances . if the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year . peter lamont s sets are more than authentic . one scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck . it then shifts to the ship s massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals . the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner . easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest . at first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else . what a lark . we ve struck an iceberg . now let s get back to our brandy and cigars . the ship s musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in . after all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers . when the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it . their civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless . the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface . there are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on . special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable . in titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs . the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water . people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately . besides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor . from the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears . " it s good-bye for a little while , " a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first .

positiveC,' grease reviewed by jamie peckrating :  paramount / 1 : 50 / 1978 / pg ( language , innuendo , brief nudity ) cast : john travolta ; olivia newton-john ; stockard channing ; jeff conaway ; barry pearl ; michael tucci ; kelly ward ; didi conn ; jamie donnelly ; dinah manoff ; eve arden ; sid caesar ; frankie avalon ; joan blondell ; edd byrnes ; alice ghostley director : randal kleiser screenplay : allan carr ; bronte woodwardthose print and television ads trumpeting that "  grease  is still the word " are right on the money . to celebrate its 20th anniversary , this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like " star wars " -- a well-deserved , red-carpet rerelease . that s fantastic , especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie ( didi conn ) being serenaded by her tell-it-like-it-is guardian angel ( frankie avalon ) ? or the hard-nosed principal ( eve arden ) reminding the student body to " be an athletic supporter " by rooting for the home team ? or national bandstand emcee vince fontaine ( edd byrnes ) flirting with marty ( a pre- " empty nest " dinah manhoff ) ? and these are all probably considered minor moments . . . a very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newton-john have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson , and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom s most effervescently charming . for those eight of you who aren t familiar with the story , here s a brief recap : greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their 1959 senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer ; both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started , but both were wrong . sandy tries to rekindle their relationship , but danny s too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t-bird buddies ( including jeff conaway ) . so sandy hooks up with a gang herself -- the pink ladies , headed by sassy , sexy rizzo ( stockard channing , just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time ) -- and danny , who still really feels love for her , attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back . the drag race finale is yet something of a drag , and i never have thought much of " greased lightening , " the film s big " guy " number ( that choreography -- ack ! ) , but " grease "  s flaws amount too few to carp . the movie s first showpiece is " summer nights , " where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun-in-the-sun romance . not only is " nights " tremendously catchy , but it s also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes . there has yet to be a live-action musical sequence that rivals the one-two punch of " you re the one that i want " and " we go together , " " grease "  s euphoric cappers . all this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller , quieter moments ; the oscar-nominated " hopelessly devoted to you " is a lovely showcase for newton-john , and channing s lamenting ballad " there are worse things i could do " is one of " grease "  s most unjustly overlooked tunes . the soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of " nights " ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan-and-scanned-out choreography , but nothing else has changed -- no computer-generated backgrounds , no outtakes or new musical numbers , no jabba the hutt cameos . and it s a testament to " grease "  s timeless success that nothing needs to be changed -- it s the same all-around blast it s always been , with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music . to  90s viewers , " grease " will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doo-wop and poodle skirts . but regardless of what decade it transports us to , we can all agree on one thing -- without a doubt , " grease " is still the word . © 1998 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/ " suggestions , please , for the fourth movie in the series . how about look who s talking back ,   in which the audience gets its turn ?

positiveC,' the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it s armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo . we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo s ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control . however , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade . no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins . it seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time . we re the fans , not the freaks . we won t go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we re throwing down . all right , stop looking at me like that . we have been faithfully and patiently waiting . waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll . you see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah . unfortunately , it is not our savior . for weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good . anything less and it ll be the biggest disappointment of the century . i didn t want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn t , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking . character development is virtually nonexistent . with the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film s characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions . none seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all . contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala . jar jar s life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) . his speech mannerisms are so " cute-ified " that i couldn t understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting . his head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as " deep doo doo , " and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport . therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors . in star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a " wretched hive of scum and villainy . " in the phantom menace , we get doo doo . the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story " a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . . . " this film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it s only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience . perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play . i liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ? the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction . this aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me . i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ? didn t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ? didn t the action figures still sell like hotcakes ? of course they did , and it s only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults . one aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects . the people at lucas s industrial light and magic , the world s premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage . some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation s robot army and jar jar s countrymen . the space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer . this , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today . john williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can . his music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately . since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar . as a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin . it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi-wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films . one of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film s release . in spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost didn t have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant . he has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean . with that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment . lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout . however , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story-writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real-life connection . oddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force-loving parasites in your body s cells . this only serves to de-mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection . don t let me mislead you too far . the phantom menace , by most standards , is a good film . it contains a lot of visual treats , sets the stage for an epic story , gives us a bit of excitement here and there , and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends . it s just that when held up to it s predecessors ( and to not do so would be unrealistic ) , this film simply pales . '
positiveC,' with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the " film noir " genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller s crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . the main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn t quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who s wise to the world , but he doesn t really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . that main character is jeffrey " the dude " lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film s rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as " quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . " the dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody s cheating in a bowling match ( " has the whole world gone crazy ? ! " he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who s always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( " donny , you have no frame of reference here ! " ) . these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of " hotel california " and , if it s possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . if that doesn t give you a good idea of this film s absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude s rug . they ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the " big " lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn t have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . unfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude s car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . soon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german " nihilists " who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . meanwhile , the big lebowski s daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . the plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival s " run through the jungle , " and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . the film doesn t feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens  other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude s dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this " jungle " but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . there s also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his " this aggression will not stand " speech . the coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( " the bums will always lose ! " shouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their " peaceful beach community , " and so on . by the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least " aggression " of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on " passive , " albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . he also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn t like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he s getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don t just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . i think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained . audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . " it s good knowin  he s out there , the dude , takin  it easy , " posits the narrator towards the end . i dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken . '
positiveC,' frothy romantic comedies have become so commonplace at the cinema that filmmakers now generally resort to gimmicks to set their films apart . two romantic comedies currently in release , the object of my affection and sliding doors , each employ a twist that gives its film a certain uniqueness , but in both cases the gimmicks work . the object of my affection roughly fits the romantic comedy mold . it has its share of humorous moments and a romantic issue at its heart , which is where its twist lies . after being jilted by his lover dr . robert joley ( tim daly ) , gay elementary school teacher george hanson ( paul rudd ) moves in and instantly becomes best friends with social worker nina borowski ( jennifer aniston ) . when nina discovers that she is pregnant by her less-than-reliable boyfriend lawyer vince mcbride ( john pankow ) , she asks george to be the child s acting father . his acceptance , not surprisingly , leads to some emotional complications for the both of them . more of a surprise is that these complications don t necessarily come dressed in laugh-ready packages . director nicholas hytner and writer wendy wasserstein , working from the novel by stephen mccauley , while frequently throwing in a comic zinger or situation or two , deal rather seriously with the relationship issues being raised . while this approach will certainly disappoint those looking for a lark like aniston s picture perfect , it was perhaps the best way to go . to go for cheap laughs would have been to cheapen the characters , in particular nina , whose ever-growing but hopeless love for george achieves true poignancy . adding to the poignancy is the terrific , natural chemistry between aniston and rudd ; even though one knows a romance is impossible , they are such a perfect screen match that one cannot help but develop a rooting interest for their coupledom . i just wish that the character of vince was better written . one minute he s a jerk , the next he s surprisingly gentle ; he doesn t quite make sense , and as such , nina s initial devotion to him doesn t quite either . on paper , the twist of sliding doors appears too high-concept for its own good . helen ( gwyneth paltrow , sporting the flawless british accent she adopted in emma ) , freshly fired from her job at a pr agency , rushes to catch the next train home . the doors on the train car close just as she reaches them . but wait--the film rewinds , and suddenly helen manages to squeeze her way into the train as the doors close . from here on out , sliding doors intercuts between the parallel tales of the two helens : helen " a , " who misses the train , and helen " b , " who makes the train . helen " b , " having made the train , arrives home in time to find her live-in boyfriend gerry ( john lynch ) in bed with sultry , slightly unhinged former flame lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . in a tiff , helen leaves him , gets a makeover , and starts a relationship with james ( john hannah ) , a friendly scottish gent she met on the train . helen " a " not only misses the train ; she is also mugged , which makes her arrive home long after gerry and lydia s tryst , of which she remains not-so-blissfully unaware . in following the two helens , writer-director peter howitt shows how one simple , chance occurrence can alter the course of a person s life . or does he ? what makes sliding doors so unique and rather thought-provoking is how howitt holds true to the idea of chance while at the same time subscribing to that of destiny . the two stories are distinctly different , but howitt comes up with clever " intersections " between the plots , with certain touchstone events occurring in both stories ( albeit in slightly altered ways ) , believably showing how , no matter what happens , the hand of fate is inescapable . also inescapable is the type of person one is , and this is best exemplified by gerry , who is a cheating lout in both stories--which is the film s one problem . although he appears to have some genuine fondness for helen , he is on the whole an unappealing character , making the story of helen " a " less vibrant and involving than the " b " tale , which is highlighted by hannah s delightfully witty james . ultimately , however , the effectiveness of the object of my affection and sliding doors is not due to the gimmicks themselves but the filmmakers who use them with care , intelligence , and style . if it weren t for their talent and savvy , the two films could have easily fallen into the gimmicky romantic comedy scrap heap , an undistinguished group that includes the execrable likes of made in america and mrs . winterbourne . and for that , every moviegoer in the world owes a debt of gratitude .

positiveC,' the postman delivers but not first class[warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post-apocalypse stories , hope in a desperate situation , grassroots uprisings and kevin costner . even worse , i thought that " waterworld " was watchable . read the following with those particular grains of salt . ] it s the year 2013 and things have fallen apart . due to a world war in the late nineties , the resulting three-year winter and a devastating plague , life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms . although this is the future , it looks like a western . as the film opens , kevin costner ( his character s name is never revealed ) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company . giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging , costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders . running into even worse luck , he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem ( will patton ) . the rag-tag retro-futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the " clan " after a brutal boot camp , he ( and you can see this coming a mile away ) escapes . taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck , he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either . once he reaches oregon , land of beautiful women , bright youngsters and rock and roll ; he pretends to be a representative from the " restored congress of the united states of america " . this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants . food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby ( olivia williams ) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile . shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman ( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film ) become a reluctant item . although the postman knows he s running a fraud , the concept of renewed communications sets the kids  imagination afire ( especially ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , his second-in-command ) and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through . the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists  tyranny . the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner . although the movie appeals to my sensibilities , there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted . it s derivitive of costner s own " waterworld " and clint eastwood westerns . there s little here that we haven t seen dozens of times before . the film is often down-right corny . a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright-eyed child is embarrassing in its slow-motion banality . the film s final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor . despite the film s excessive three hour length , several things are never explained . what was the war about ? how did civilization change so rapidly ? everyone has horses : where did all they come from ? the " law of eights " that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film , but where ? are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn t made their way west to help or conquer ? there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn t appear to make sense . the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments , but beyond that there are some oddities . the evil army is called " holnists " which sounds coincidentally like the new age " holism " , but why ? is it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 , just one year after many ancient prophesies ( including the ending of the mayan calendar ) predict a new world for mankind ? why is the general named " bethlehem " ? there seems to be some reason for that , but what ? sometimes the movie feels like a joke . an army of postal workers armed with guns ? considering the headlines of recent years , it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys . it s even more difficult to accept those re-powering the federal government as the heroes . given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government , it s asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film s nationalism . even with its numerous flaws , the movie all comes together , if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have . it s doubtful that " the postman " is going to find much of an audience , but a few of us are going to have a good time . besides we re all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug .

" ) . to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith . drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep " godless science " from talking to god , or something like that ) . then hadden reappears with startling news . he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest . ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse ) . when she returns home , no one believes her . she was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours . her story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don t even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static . . . eighteen hours worth of static ) . there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first . ellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working . neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that s a tough standard to meet . ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures . her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally . drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble . hadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board . even palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie s love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses . the film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine . the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain . the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion . this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved . the film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith . religious people are presented as shallow caricatures . rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right . another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey ) . the only really fleshed-out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague . i can t even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian . all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex . the film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith . in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist " religious " doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send . in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism . what ellie should have said was , " you shouldn t believe me . not without evidence , and i don t have the evidence . i know what happened but you shouldn t take my word alone . " that is the voice of science speaking . the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film . his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position . also , his profession of " faith " before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it . the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles . the media figures , such as bernard shaw and jay leno aren t so bad , in as much as their participation was voluntary . the use of bill clinton , however , should give anyone pause . first of all , lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line , thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken , is just plain creepy . also , using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 , forever dating it . people watching this film in the future will say , " hey , this never took place during clinton s term . " this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief . also , the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century . better to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all . the film does raise an interesting question , although it never develops it in a satisfying way . if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture , would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god , or at least some form of supernatural creator ? personally , i would hope not , since religion is basically an opinion , a form of ideology . i would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task .

positiveC,' clint eastwood , in his ripe old age , is cashing one talent in for another . midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood-directed film clint isn t even in , and it s damn good . adapted from a best-selling john berendt novel based on true events , this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah , where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head . and that s just the mayor . as director and producer , eastwood contributes a self- indulgent but very competent 150 minutes , neatly balancing drama , suspense and humor . like all great movies , midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves , and not from some contrived , juvenile intrusion . the acting , from big-time stars john cusack and kevin spacey , is as good as you d expect , but it s the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm . cusack plays a free-lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town & country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey s parties . lots of food , beverages and gunplay . yes , an employee of spacey s has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead . it seems like a simple matter of self- defense -- the guy threatened spacey , shot at him , missed , then spacey took him out -- but being a movie , there s much more to it than that , and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder , a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in . the weird circle of entertainment . this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in . there s the requisite sexy woman ( alison " nepotist s daughter " eastwood ) , the strange piano player , the voodoo woman and the transvestite . miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his/her own , as the stealer of every scene she appears in -- what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony ? chablis , playing herself , is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul , but never seems exploited as the movie s comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie . there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes , which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie , but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating . certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey s lawyer both help immensely , as does having the fly-guy as the jury s foreman . it s here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey s homosexuality . yes , spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man -- before he shot him , of course . midnight in the garden of good and evil isn t a classic , but it is one of the better celebrity-directed , true-story best-seller adaptations out there . likewise , no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations , but the performances are all great . in fact , i d almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category .

( this leads us to one of the best lines in the picture : " if you don t stop hanging off me like crap out of a carp s butt , i ll beat you senseless ! " sanpei , however , takes this as an invitation to s&m , and is even more turned on . ) movies like this either work or they don t , and most of the reason they work is style . sukeban deka has its over-the-top-ness right about 80% of the time . one of the evil girls in the story wears cammo fatigues underneath her negligee ; another dresses like a walking bondage outfitter s ad and hides snakes in her cleavage . ( the fetish for snakes bleeds over into the intercollary images that flash up between scenes : when someone gets double-crossed , we see flash shots of one snake sinking its fangs into the other . ) one fight is punctuated with a passing train , which conveniently hides all the screams . but there are parts of the story where the plot is just stretched too thin , and could have used some extra writing -- maybe even some over-writing . there s a whole brainwashing subplot that surfaces about two-thirds of the way through , which feels suspiciously plastered on , as if the scriptwriters were desperate for something to spin things in a new direction . also , saki s enemies -- three sisters who control the school s illegal activities -- are also patchy : the most villanous of the bunch is not really the most memorable , and vice versa . a little more work in this department , and they would really have had something here . as it stands , it s not bad at all , just limited and inconsistent . footnote : part of the reason for the patchiness of the story may be its source material . sukeban deka was adapted from a manga which ran for eight years and twelve volumes , and the movie borrows its story from the first and part of the second volumes . shinji wada , the original writer and artist , had a hand in the production and the script , but there s still been a great deal of condensation and collapsing . i went back and read the entire series myself -- the scope of the whole story is staggering , to put it mildly -- and can see why they might have had trouble packing even the first story into a two-hour movie .

positiveC,' member of the  internet movie critic s association  http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/studio/5713/index . html the easiest noun to use in describing  mercury rising  would be " routine " . it s a simple description but it fits . i have to say up front that the movie is mildly entertaining on a trashy sort of level in the sense that it s best not to think about it too much after you leave the theatre . you can t fault movie critics too much for repeating themselves because it s only due to the fact that films keep repeating themselves and critics comment on what they see . it s sort of like a quarterback who sticks with the plays that work . if it s a winning formula , stick with it and as long as people keep dishing out enough money to see action stars in their repetitive vehicles , hollywood will keep making them . the problem with bruce willis is that he fails to connect in finding a different personality for each character he plays . clint eastwood made dirty harry different from josey wales and his gunslinger in  unforgiven  was quite different from the drill sergeant he played in  heartbreak ridge  . all the recent characters that bruce willis has played have looked and felt the same . 1997 s  the fifth element  was like watching john mcclane ( willis  character in the  die hard  trilogy ) wake up after being in a chamber of cryogenic technology for three hundred years , thawed out to strut his stuff with futuristic bad guys and it failed with most critics except those radical science fiction fans who refuse to knock even the worst of that genre . i really haven t seen willis in a top notch role since his 1994 attempt at serious stuff such as  pulp fiction  and  nobody s fool  . i wish he d go back to the stuff he has the potential with and earn a respectable name for himself but he s becoming a stereotyped performer like sylvester stallone and wesley snipes . the plot line in  mercury rising  concerns a nine year old autistic boy who has cracked a secret government code which will be used to protect the covert operations of secret u . s . agents all over the world . he got the code from a puzzle book and it just so happens that two government computer programmers put the code in the book on purpose , testing its reliability , knowing ( or at least counting on the fact ) that no one will be able to crack it but not understanding that the human brain will always remain a mystery . their boss , an evil government stooge ( alec baldwin ) , is outraged that his employees would pull such a stunt and baldwin takes steps to eliminate all traces of the boy s involvement with the code and the government office that created it . this includes killing the boy s parents and willis plays a demoted fbi agent who investigates the murder of the boy s parents and eventually ends up the boy s protector when things get more and more dangerous . director harold becker (  the onion field  ,  taps  ,  sea of love  ,  malice  ) has used his typical style of stretching a story out to be much more than it really is , spreading the plot too thin in an attempt to cover up plot holes and while it hasn t worked for him in the past , it doesn t work here . based on the novel  simple simon  by ryne douglas pearson and written by lawrence konner , ryne douglas pearson and mark rosenthal ,  mercury rising  isn t a film i can recommend for its originality , but it has some decent action sequences as the film is evenly paced and it is touching in a certain way as willis plays the responsible role of the boy s protector and while that may be no big deal to cynics , the film has a style with an average intention to please audiences and because of that it does have some merit .

positiveC,' after a stylistic detour with mrs . parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph s atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director  meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . until mrs . parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . i found equinox , his last pre- mrs . parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . in short , rudolph has created a world that it s worth spending two hours in . afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . all she s interested in is seducing him during those few days when she s ovulating . after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they re no more content than jeffrey and marianne . a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won t allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn t take long before they re lounging together , naked , in her pool . meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . sex means something different to everyone  to jeffrey , it s an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it s a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it s an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . lara flynn boyle , who wasn t impressive in rudolph s equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph s most pregnant lines with practiced ease . the clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis . her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film s humor , and there s hardly ever a moment when she doesn t steal the spotlight from her co-stars . i don t know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director s earlier productions . enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . afterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that s the real reason to see this motion picture . rudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction .

" the answer from my point of view is " no " . braveheart was a truly gritty , and , one would imagine , realistic battle film . ryan is ten times worse . expect disembowelments , sucked in skulls , heads blown to bits , arms and legs flying across the battlefield . many in the theater could not bear to watch . and it is a shame , too , because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year . but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters ( and academy members ) . saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d-day , 1944 , through into the film s primary mission . captain miller ( hanks ) assembles an 8 man crew and sets off to find a missing solider , private ryan , whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield . the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs . ryan doesn t recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons , that no person should suffer such injustice . miller s crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan , though they don t yet know him . they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesn t have any more or less right to live than any of them . this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and , though there is a lot of set up between battles , the story continues full speed to the end . the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it s own . spielberg , though not a student of the " quick cut " school of filmmaking , takes a stab at it here , and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it . bay should pay close attention , take copious notes . if you want to jump cut every two seconds , do it the way spielberg does it in ryan . in the end , the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the " importance " of the film . schindler s list taught many people the truth about the holocaust . it opened eyes , sparked debate and study . though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before , they don t amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler s list . overall , this is just the truest depiction of the old adage , " war is hell . " but braveheart-dosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately , and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again . masterful work marred only by excessive gore .

" rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others  sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power . dr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss . first , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonzález ) , who has neither a mother nor a father . next , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( damián delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities . through his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self-respect , and defines himself only by his pistol . along the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( damián alcázar ) , a priest who has lost his faith . as domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching . last , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn t spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her . sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in " men with guns . " ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . ) he creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo . their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film s overarching theme of violence as power - domingo s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes  belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is isn t ) . the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself . sayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in " matewan " ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in " lone star " ( 1996 ) . sayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( " gattaca " ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain . sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects . the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border . it would not be a stretch to say that " men with guns " is a depressing film . in fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure . in addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo s inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being . nevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly . the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , " nobody refuses the men with guns .

positiveC,' the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau s intimacy has already garnered much notoriety , but it s in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance ( angels & insects ) and kerry fox ( welcome to sarajevo ) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered . with sharp , intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity , rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols . their sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty , in the acceptance of flesh and messiness . less apparent , but no less remarkable , are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance , often without a single line of dialogue . not aiming for the spiritual poetry of in the realm of the senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash , chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development . that may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive but never particularly significant on more than a tactile , sensory level . the themes of human isolation are barren and obvious , a science project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis . intimacy does manage to stand out from lesser portraits of " human interconnectedness " and pinter-esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers ( okay , kill me ) . shallow though it might sound , it s amazing how much is filled in through an inspired cast , perceptive camerawork , and imaginative ways of treating the love scene . those ingredients are too assured and confident to merely dismiss as icing on the cake , especially since they are the substance of the cake itself . adapted from a pair of short stories by british novelist hanif kureishi , intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between two strangers in london . every wednesday , jay ( rylance ) and claire ( fox ) meet in his cluttered , dank apartment for an hour or two of sexual release from their uninspired lives . he s been head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years . she s a mystery to him but her glum workaday appearance reveals a similar dissatisfaction . they re both married , but his relationship has curdled into an embittered separation . as the weeks draw on , jay obsessively takes it upon himself to uncover claire s personal routines . in his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she is , he opens wounds that hadn t existed before by single-handedly corrupting the fantasy . if it weren t for a few unnecessary subplots involving jay s brother and his bevy of disgruntled co-workers , this minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable on the perils of wish fulfillment . chareau s restless camera ( once again wielded by superb and ever-attentive cinematographer eric gautier ) is less appropriate here than in his family transit-oriented those who love me can take the train . the scenes that linger are the still ones where rylance and fox separately , pensively attempt to carry on with their makeshift household routines . these are often captured in lingering , unblinking wide shots that view them stranded amidst their drab workplaces and homes . separation proves haunting in a melancholy series of intercut shots as rylance and fox undress on opposite sides of the room , crawling across the floor to meet in the center . despite being as restless as a fly during the hyperactive restaurant scenes ( all the better to blend in with a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters ) , you d be hard pressed to find a single uninteresting image . intimacy takes an interest in its sordid world of the lower-middle class , with lonely pubs and busy shopping streets -- it also understands the people who inhabit those spaces , viewing them with sympathy scraped raw . an evaluation would be incomplete without highlighting the great timothy spall ( the robust scene-stealer of many a mike leigh collaboration ) . as claire s cuckolded husband , this jocular heavyweight plays out his handful of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace and self-effacing embarrassment of his imposing bulk . bangs in his eyes , his mouth forming into quizzical pouts and dry smirks , he may seem the fool in his barroom encounters opposite a sarcastic , gleaming mark rylance ( whose jay has arrived on the scene looking to stir up some trouble ) , but spall is no one to trifle with . his overreaching best pal demeanor suggests a mind abuzz with secret passageways of guile , his pointed questions only naïve if you choose not to read into their crafty insinuations . in his unassuming way , spall s carefully etched interpretation of hostility buried under a mountain of surface propriety may become one of the most criminally underappreciated performances of the year , but maybe also one of the best . he s that good .

positiveC,' o ( 1999 ) . starring mekhi phifer , josh hartnett , julia stiles , martin sheen , andrew keegan , rain phoenix , elden henson and john heard . written by brad kaaya . directed by tim blake nelson . rated r . running time : 91 minutes . a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings . a prime example of this is 1999 s 10 things i hate about you , which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school . less successful was last year s adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp . here the setting was the corporate world of new york . now comes o , a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare s tragedies . like 10 things i hate about you , the stage is a high school - a private prep school where odin james ( mekhi phifer ) is the on-court general , the basketball team s standout player . julia stiles , featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke s hamlet , plays desi brable , odin s girlfriend , whose father also happens to be dean of the institution . josh hartnett ( pearl harbor ) is on hand for the villainy , playing the scheming hugo , who sets the tragic wheels in motion . o was actually filmed a couple of years ago , but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy . the movie , directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother , where art thou ? - and written by brad kaaya , is very grim . an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits . and that is how it should be . of all of shakespeare s tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery . kaaya s profane-filled script - after all , these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts . the young man considers himself the basketball team s prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass , shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin . plus his father , the team s coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood . the script follows the familiar lines of the classic . hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi s fidelity , eroding the star s confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game . it all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved . the performances in o vary . phifer is at first cocky and self-assured , emotions he handles with ease . he also does quite well displaying odin s darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution , his growing distrust of those he loved , his rage and the erosion of his belief system . hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit , turning friend against friend , and lover against lover . stiles seems a bit stilted , but occasionally also rises to the occasion , moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight . the film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo s theft of the school mascot is left hanging . also desi s actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) , odin s former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo s machinations , is puzzling . why she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back . it is irrational . but these are minor carpings . overall , o is a stylish and faithful adaptation . if nothing else , it may encourage some people to read the original text , and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature . bob bloom is the film critic at the journal and courier in lafayette , in . he may be reached by e-mail at bloom@journal-courier . com or at bobbloom@iquest . net .  other reviews by bloom can be found at www . jconline . com by clicking on golafayette . bloom s reviews also can be found on the web at the internet movie database : http : //www . imdb . com/m/reviews_by ? bob + bloom '
positiveC,' review by laurence mixson ( venom8@hotmail . com ) starring sigourney weaver , paul reiser , michael beihn , and bill paxton . every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre : with dramas , it was citizen kane , with arthouse it was pulp fiction , and with comedy it was , well , that jim carrey guy ( okay , so he s not a movie , but he did have a huge influence on the genre . not to mention an expensive one . ) sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big , sprawling motion picture event , as did forrest gump four years ago . with action films , it was aliens , whic was released to much hype seven years after it s equally-innovative parent , alien ( 1979 ) . directed and written by james cameron ( t2 : judgement day , the abyss , true lies ) , the authority on action films , it was a masterful encore to his sci-fi thriller the terminator ( 1984 ) . while the original alien film was a dark , enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew , james cameron took the big-budget action film with aliens , which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing , although on a much-larger scale . and boy , did he take that route ! i d say at about 165 mph or so . . . the film opens 57 years after the original , with lt . ripley ( weaver ) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel . if you ll recall , at the end of alien ripley , the only surviving member , cryogenically " hibernated " herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship . unfortunately , she thought she d only be out for a couple of weeks . . . once she s returned to earth , ripley is quickly interrogated by " the company " , who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy . in truth , they believe her , as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an " alien advisor " . it seems that the colony planet was a once-breeding ground for the nasty aliens , and now all communication with the planet has been lost . . . it doesn t exactly take a genius to guess what happens next : ripley agrees , and before you can say " big mistake " , she and the half dozen marines , plus the slimy corporate guy ( reiser ) , who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve , are off to the colony . when they arrive , they find the planet in ruins . only one survivor is found , a little girl , newt , who confirms that , yes , the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system . and soon enough , the marines come under attack from the aliens . . . what happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci-fi movie : the action scenes . cameron directs them so skillfully , and so suspensefully , that you re literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around . which features , in my opinion , the best fight scene ever recorded on film , as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death . many people will tell you that this film , while being a great action film , has no real drama and is all cliches . well , they would be wrong , my friends . if this film had no " drama " , then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards ? that s right , best actress . you know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and f/x has got to be good . in short , aliens combines all the right elements ( great action and f/x , drama , a good plot , good dialogue , and great villains ) into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time . then again , maybe not . movies rise and fall from glory and , sad to say , aliens was wrestled from it s throne of best action movie by another cameron film , t2 : judgement day , in 1991 . so who will be the next king ? well , let s wait until december 19th and see yet another james cameron film-the highest budgeted film of all time-titanic to make that decision . i can t wait .

positiveC,' ciby 2000/miramax - 1994 starring toni collette , bill hunter , rachel griffiths screenplay by p . j . hogan produced by lynda house and jocelyn moorhouse directed by p . j . hogan rated aa [adult accompaniment for those under fourteen] in ontario for profanity and mature themes after a successful run in australia last year , and with much critical praise heaped upon it , muriel s wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america . muriel heslop is a withdrawn , overweight young woman living in porpoise spit , australia . she is often the target of her father s frequent rants at the family , and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage . her self-loathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success ; marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired . after her four cliquey friends dump her , muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls , and muriel s wedding unfolds from there . toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance , conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted . collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character . she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma , easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance . collette basically carries the film , appearing in almost every scene . muriel s father , bill " the battler " heslop , is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician/developer . while chumming around with young fans and crowing  you can t beat progress  ( his slogan ) , bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments . rachel griffiths plays rhonda , who becomes muriel s cheeky new friend in the film . she has good chemistry with collette , and the film suffers when griffiths is off-screen . muriel s tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two-dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan s scripting muriel s wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm . hogan s use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile . hogan s script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel s earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her . the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch . muriel s wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p . j . hogan . on my four star scale , i give muriel s wedding three stars .

positiveC,' director : michael winterbottom writer : hossein amini ( based on the novel " jude the obscure " by thomas hardy ) starring : christopher eccleston , kate winslet , liam cunningham , rachel griffiths , june whittfield , ross curvin turnball , james daley no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , " jude the obscure , " his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . but , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . " jude " is a satirical film from start to finish about society s way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what s remarkable is how timeless this film is . the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn t really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it d be kinda different ( a given ) . it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from " shallow grave " ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams . in its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world . after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life . taking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself . but when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker . another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher . she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . several twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile . because they aren t married , and because they re cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on . if you didn t think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . . the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world . he will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . part of it is his fault - he s too optimistic , and too gullible . but society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death . the ending of " jude " is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i ll have to read it now ) . " jude " offers a satirical view on society s cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn t . there s no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people s minds , and that s what " jude " is . sure , it s one hell of a downer , but it needs to be . the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it . christopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times . kate winslet , in a pre- " titanic " performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who s troubled but very seductive with her personality . kate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don t believe me , see " titanic , " branagh s " hamlet , " " sense and sensibility , " and " heavenly creatures , " the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) . in the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude s wife , whom he never divorces . " jude " moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts . but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate " jude , " though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it .

positiveC,' shakespeare . you hardly understood it in high school . why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn t count on it ? if this is your attitude , then i ll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh s hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now . if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark . namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king s brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play . his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother s hands . hamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery . . . . and the game is afoot . . . . the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes . with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established . interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers . the hamlet castle s grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft . costuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination . . not quite the denmark of the 1600 s , the characters  attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel . it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively . in addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character . as the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows . from the anticipation of seeing his father s ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades . every scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh s acting and directing as to shakespeare s manuscript . hamlet seems to be a who s who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself . julie christie , as hamlet s mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players . kate winslet as hamlet s lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character s plummet to the depths of dispair and madness . richard briers as ophelia s father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing . nicholas farrell as hamlet s trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two-timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast . hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible . in some cases , this made for interesting scenes . billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well . crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene . however , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all . as the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba . part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time . his off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor . i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention . unfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions . jack lemmon , an excellent actor , just can t do shakespeare . as marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet s ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him . gerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of " yes , my lord " and " no , my lord " in the role of reynaldo . richard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk-on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador . i think he had two lines . then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway . when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was . if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you . hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one . branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback-type images . this only works about half the time , and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them . you don t have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare , but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly . the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar , the high school english course . in it , you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king s english . or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes .

positiveC,' director : michael hoffman screenplay : terrel seltzer and ellen simon producer : via rosa productions / fox 2000 pictures running time : approx . 108 minutes . cast : michelle pfeiffer , george clooney , mae whitman , alex linz rating : k , i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start . a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents ? with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure ? yuck . but it s not really too bad . it has a lot working against it , for me at least . in addition to the above , it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made-for-tv movie , but longer and with bigger stars , and you have to pay to see it . it does win you over , though , even if it is painfully predictable . just think about it : two single parents , with their cute kids , are thrown together due to a missed field trip . through a day of near disasters , they cont inually meet , get in one another s way , cause trouble for one another , and generally insult one another at every opportunity . in fact , they hate each other so much that we know that they are , or soon will be , in love . the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples . so this film is predictable , just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable ( and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman s model for this film ) . will they get fired from their yuppie jobs ? will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids ? will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex-husband , a drummer for bruce springsteen , really is ( aren t they all ? ) ? will they finally kiss ? well , what do you expect ? but there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled , especially when it is done with as much humour , along with a lack of sticky sentimentality , as it is in this film . pfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming , and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show . one word of caution , though . this film is being billed in some places as a " family " movie . don t let that stop you . however , i think most kids , especially boys , would be pretty bored by this move . after all , nobody gets killed and there are no explosions . all in all , a good , non-offensive date movie . the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice . this movie review was written for the flying inkpot : an arts and entertainment magazine from singapore . current film reviews can be found at :  " http : //www . inkpot . com/film/ '

positiveC,' starring james dean , natalie wood , sal mineo , jim backus , ann doran , corey allen , william hopper , and dennis hopper . " rebel without a cause " is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to . everyone feels that they are different in some way , that they don t belong in some places and " rebel without a cause " successfully shows on screen these universal emotions . no matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present . this is why james dean is admired by america , because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute . in our minds , we just try to do the right thing just like dean s jim stark does . not only does " rebel without a cause " display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure . each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection . this is because times change and in response people change . no matter how popular you were once , as your generation grows older , newer breeds look at you in a different light . this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents . even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past , the teens could not believe this . in one humorous scene , stark , his girlfriend judy ( natalie wood ) , and his pal plato ( sal mineo ) pretend they are adults . they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored . this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another . speaking on behalf of my generation , i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by . the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation . same goes for brando , redford , even deniro . i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon , ben affleck , and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century . will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten ? any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film . even if " rebel without a cause " has some ridiculous scenes ( the game of chicken - did people really act this way ? ) , an unbelievable conclusion ( how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end ? ) , and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film . the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool . now , however , the coolness is fading . . .

positiveC,' mary norton s children s book series , the borrowers , has been made into several below-average television movies . so , i wasn t too enthused as i entered the theater for the big-screen debut of the minute clan . but i was in for a shock , the borrowers is actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs and even some decent special effects . the lender family is being thrown out of their longtime home . their aunt , who owned the property , never left a will . now , an unscrupulous lawyer , ocious potter ( john goodman ) plans to demolish the house and replace it with an ultra-modern housing development . but the lenders are not alone in their house . living under the floorboards is a family of borrowers , 4 inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human " beans " above . the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders , especially once they discover the evil potter actually has a copy of the will which leaves the home to the lenders . so it is up to the clocks ( pod ( jim broadbent ) and homily ( celia imrie ) , along with their kids , arrietty ( flora newbigin ) and peagreen ( tom felton ) ) to recover the will and save the household . but when potter learns of the tiny people , he enlists the skills of exterminator jeff ( mark williams ) to kill off the clan . there s plenty of attention to detail in the borrowers , especially in the furnishings of the clock family house , made out of lost board game parts and credit cards . the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story . the various predicaments of the clock family are clever and thrilling . based on an original story , the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all the potential and unusual perils that could exist for a 4-inch tall person . as the villain , john goodman s performance veers on the edge of being over-the-top . but his performance suits the role well , and he does very well in the film s many slapstick moments . with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets , bluescreen shots and cgi , the special effects in the borrowers are very well done . there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work , but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief . hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a children-only movie , for it is surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch .

positiveC,' two girls and a guy ( fox searchlight - 1998 ) starring robert downey jr . , heather graham , natasha gregson wagner screenplay by james toback produced by edward r . pressman , chris hanley directed by james toback running time : 92 minutes note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . ------------------------------------------------------------- james toback s return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue . embracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters . fortunately , the film s cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing . the film s setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly . we meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft . as they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn t take long for them to come to the realisation that they re being two-timed by the same guy . more indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation . it s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride . played with magnificent bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights . it s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour . whether he s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful . though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly . ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla s unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat s out of the bag . ) double-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs . surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film . however , it d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou s outrage to full feature-length , and it s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel . the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film s tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat . subtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale . one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla . two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr . toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film s thematic narrative is rather dubious . if anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr . downey jr . , whose versatility is put to the test in this film . he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered . it s a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake s self-chiding to " get [his] shit together " is disquieting in its resonance . while mr . downey jr .  s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles . ms . graham is quickly becoming one of america s more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman . she s quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry . meanwhile , ms . gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing . she tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox . the film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout . two girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr . toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors . while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn t feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background , and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner . two girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it s still often an enjoyable , bitingly funny romp , particularly as we watch the surprisingly-resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends . " i m an actor , " he tells them at one point , using the ol  tried-and-tested occupational-hazard defense . " actors lie . " but not , they all seem to agree , denzel washington . '
positiveC,' directed by robert de niro . written by chazz palminteri ( based on his play ) . running time : 122 minutes . rated r ( for language and scenes containing violence ) . a bronx tale reminds me a lot of goodfellas . it stars robert de niro who also directed . it also has a cameo by joe pesci . i thought i even saw martin scorsece as a priest at a confessional . i began to think that this movie took it s style and grace from goodfellas . then it hit me that it reminded me of goodfellas because a bronx tale is almost as great . lorenzo ( robert de niro ) is a working man . he has a city job as a bus driver and makes enough to let his wife and son live well in an apartment in the bronx . he never got in the popular gangster business that ruled the area . the apartment he lives in in near a busy bar that is home to many of these gangsters . he tells his 9 year old son calogero ( francis capra ) to never go in there and to stay on his stoop in front of the complex . in a discussion earlier lorenzo talked to his son about talent . calogero asks him who was the best baseball player of all time . lorenzo tells him it was joey d ( imaggio ) because he has class and talent . calogero asks if he has any talent . lorenzo says that he has all the talent in the world and just needs to use it wisely . calogero witnesses a shooting while sitting on the stoop commited by the local main gangster sonny ( chazz palminteri who also wrote the script ) . when confronted by a police officer who is shown a line of suspects and asked who shot . the lineup consists of some of the workers and some gansters who were the bar . sonny is in the lineup . calogero walks past the line saying that none of the men commited the murder . lorenzo takes him upstairs to get him ready for bed . calogero asks his father if he did the right thing . lorenzo says " you did a very good thing for a very bad man . " cut to the late 60s . calogero ( now nicknamed c by sonny and played by lillo brancato ) now is 17 years old and one of sonny s " men " . lorenzo is shocked that his son has not listened to anything he has said through the years . c now has become everything lorenzo hates . a gangster who wants his money the second he asks . a bronx tale is actor robert de niro first directed film . he does a great job directing himself and others . some of the scenes such as a fight in the bar are very nicely edited and staged to music that sets the mood . palmenteri also does a great job as sonny and is both frightening and fatherlike in the same instant . lillo brancato is a great find and plays his part very well . he is a charming young actor who i hope has a good career . the film is also suprising funny . it is probably the most upbeat ganster picture if you don t count jonny dangerously ( which i don t ) . there is a great scene in the first 20 minutes where c narrates the people young calogero meets in the bar . some has nicknames like coffeecake ( the look of that man s face ) and whispers ( everything s a secret to him ) . the film ends suddenly and makes me ask for more . it is noticably very short considering goodfellas was about 20 minutes longer . still a bronx tale fills it s tight 2 hours with as much as it can . i wanted to spend more time finding out what happens to c . i doubt a sequel will be made but i d still like to know .

sure . but embracing the idea of suspension of disbelief is as old as the film industry itself . bruce willis stars as the best core driller in the world . he s an aspiring oil man and the first time we see him he s chipping golf balls from his off shore rig at a greenpeace boat , filled with protesters who duck each time a golf ball comes their way and clangs off a beam just over their heads as willis laughs . one of his crew ( ben affleck ) is having an affair with his daughter ( liv tyler ) and other members of willis  crew ( will patton , steve buscemi ) work closely as his best friends . willis is called in by a nasa chief ( billy bob thornton ) who explains the impending doom and asks willis to apply his core drilling skills and destroy the rocky menace . willis agrees only if he can have his own men brought along and their training is a scene straight out of  the right stuff  only it crosses with some slapstick and looks more like the wrong stuff and this scene is aloof . in reality , not all of these men would pass the training course to cut the mustard is taking a trip to outer space and this plot hole is about the silliest the film has to offer . the most unusual character in the film is a russian cosmonaut on board the space station mir played by peter stormare . the  fargo  reunion is in this film . he and steve buscemi appeared in  fargo  and are in this film . you remember stormare as the thug who didn t say too much in  fargo  and who eventually cuts buscemi s head off with an axe and stuffed him into a wood chipper . stormare even sports the same type of winter hat he had in  fargo  and i m wondering if it s an in joke here . ditto on the  pulp fiction  reunion .  pulp fiction  even gets mentioned in  armageddon  by one of the cast .  armageddon  has bruce willis and steve buscemi . buscemi plays the buddy holly waiter in  pulp fiction  . the other giant meteor film ,  deep impact  , released earlier this year is better than this film because it had the human element more tightly wound around it plot line and there really is no good reason why  armageddon  has to be two and a half hours long . there are too many silly scenes of corny dialogue and too much time is spent at the site of the meteor which doesn t look convincing but the film s saving grace is its eye popping special effects , booming sound effects and clever sets which tower over the entire production . director michael bay (  the rock  ,  bad boys  ) never gives the audience a chance to breathe and a bit more subtlety would have been nice and while it is often said that less is more ,  armageddon  is still good to look at and a treat to listen to and while the film comes out looking exactly the way the film makers intended it to , it can t be all that bad but it s a film you ll only want to see once .

positiveC,' " when it s cold , molecules aren t moving . everything is clean . " these are the essential words of mikey carver ( elijah wood ) , a young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan , connecticut in the ice storm . when mikey delivers these words to a bored science class , it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey s life and the lives that surround him . his father jim ( jamey sheridan ) is rarely seen and his mother janey ( sigourney weaver ) is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood ( kevin kline ) . ben s wife elena ( joan allen ) suspects the affair , but doesn t say anything . meanwhile , ben s 14-year-old daughter wendy ( christina ricci ) continuously lures mikey and his younger brother sandy ( adam hann-byrd ) into sexual explorations . tobey maguire plays paul hood , the 16-year-old narrator of the story who also happens to be the least prevalent character . we start the film with an interesting outlook on family from paul . he compares family to the fantastic four comic book , and even goes so far as to say that family is everybody s own anti-matter ; something everybody will return to eventually , and the farther you go , the deeper you ll return . the ice storm is a character piece that explores a dismal time both in america , and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie . everything parallels everything else . the young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs , sex , and alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods . " when it s cold outside , the molecules aren t moving . everything is clean . " everything is clean because nobody will admit what s going on . even the president is on tv denying his wrong-doings . how can you expect anything more out of a couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution ? all the sex and drugs is so obviously empty , and i think that s the point of the film . at first viewing , the entire movie might seem empty , but then why shouldn t it parallel itself ? you don t get to know the characters very deeply , but i think that s because nobody in the movie knows each other either . we sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another . at first glance , you might think emotion is lost in the ending scenes because you haven t gotten to know the characters well enough to sympathize - then you realize that just might be the point , and then you do feel the pain . the acting by all is quite good , but i particularly liked elijah wood . he doesn t seem to be receiving as much recognition as the others , but i still found him to possess quite a real sense of being . christina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in the pants of every available boy . still , i say hats off remain to wood , joan allen s subtle but believable performance as a lonely , unappreciated wife , and the always excellent kevin kline . tobey maguire did a fine job , but his character which , perhaps , was the most intact , sensible person in the story , seemed a little lost . he was needed , but perhaps he should ve been used more . the ice storm is being hailed by many as one of the best films of the year . i hate to say that i don t agree , but i don t . in fact , i can think of many other films that i would rank higher than this one . even so , it is a very good film . it takes a lot of retrospect to fully appreciate it s art , but when you finally start seeing things in it that you didn t before , you start to grow even fonder of the characters and the story . perhaps this is one to see , ponder , and then watch again with different eyes .

it s funny ! ) for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases : the adventures of elmo in grouchland , madeline , the nuttiest nutcracker , muppets from space , and baby geniuses ( the only bad thing about this entire dvd . . . i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses ) . dvd-rom features are also on the disc , including web links and a demo of the stuart little cd-rom game . but wait . . . there s still more ! there s a section called " basement treasures " where you will find the auditions of the film s animators , six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director , a visual effects gag reel , a production gag reel , and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene ( with commentary from the director ) . the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson . they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film s production . minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script , namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski ( who wrote the people vs . larry flynt and ed wood ) and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( who wrote splash and multiplicity , among others ) . anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur . the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film . movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track , serious animation buffs will love the second one . now i know this is slightly off topic , but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now . one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called " i need to know " by a group called r angels . this video features four mid-teenage girls ( the singers obviously ) having a slumber party . the girls ask a ouija board " i need to know . . . who to do , who to do , who to do " as the song begins . they then sneak out of their house , and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits . then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like " i ll be your pleasure all the time . . . just say the words that you ll be mine " . um . . . what the hell ? what does this have to do with stuart little ? how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie , let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd ? when the video concludes , the words " to be continued " appear . oh i can t wait to see who they ve slept with when the toy story 2 dvd comes out . kids won t care about most of the special features on this dvd , but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a " kid at heart " thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them . this is the way to do dvd , a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost . the di$ney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar . reviewed by chuck dowling - chuckd21@fdn . com the jacksonville film journal - http : //www . jaxfilmjournal . com/ '

" magnolia " is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of " boogie nights " fame . the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make " magnolia " memorable . however , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing . anderson s control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful . he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of " magnolia s " scenes drag on too long . any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending . from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn t get boring . it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot . this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation . every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees . for example , cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall s daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly . the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer . anderson s explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing . the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously . this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get . the performances in " magnolia " are perfection . this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting . anderson allows many of hollywood s best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting . all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film . worth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance . he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon s character as phillip baker hall s wife . she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film . " magnolia " uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters . anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours . to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity . diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time . i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future .

" the horse whisperer " is filmed primarily in montana , where the grass grows tall and for some is greener on the other side . for others , less jaded , this turf is the color of the finest emerald . the movie , which stars robert redford ( who also directed and co-produced the story from a best-selling novel by the english writer nicholas evans ) , deals with a woman who edits a slick , urban magazine , is vaguely dissatisfied with her marriage to a good man , and who finds passion and meaning among people who live in a different world . annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) lives with her lawyer husband robert ( sam neill ) and their 14-year-old daughter grace ( scarlett johansson ) . on one snowy day in their upstate new york country home , young grace goes for a ride with her friend on her beloved horse pilgrim . a freak accident throws her friend from her horse where she is pulled along the ground . grace s attempt to rescue her pal puts both in the path of a skidding 18-wheeler , killing her friend , injuring pilgrim severely , and causing grace to lose part of her right leg . annie must now cope with a teenager who is plunged into depression and a badly damaged horse which has become so traumatized that he turns feral . the scenario brings to mind a news event which broke just two weeks before the opening of the picture . . . * * * nolensville , tenn . ( ap may 5 ) -- an enraged horse known for being unruly kicked a man to death . sheriff s sgt . robert dillon said tuesday that billy camron , believed to be 64 , suffered severe injuries to his head , back and other parts of his body and also had several bite marks . dillon quoted camron s son as saying " it was just a mean horse . " deputies said they found the horse running " rampant in the field " when they arrived monday night . the son authorized the horse to be killed . * * * pilgrim , however , had never been a mean horse and had , in fact , tried to protect his rider from injury . wounds inflicted on him had turned him into a untamed beast , and annie rejects the advice of her vet ( cherry jones ) to " put him down " seeking out a horse whisperer to restore his sanity . " the horse whisperer " encompasses two epic stories during its ample , 164-minute span . on one level , the picture deals with the attempts of the title character , tom booker ( robert redford ) to administer to a psychotic animal using a technique unknown in the east and , in fact , even in his own country . as booker puts it , he does not treat people with a horse problem ; he handles horses with people difficulties . on another plane , " the horse whisperer " is a romance involving a slowly-growing relationship between a gentle rancher who has not felt the pangs of love since he split up with his wife , and an edgy , urban sophisticate who had not realized she could respond in a vigorous way to a man . the heady effect of the plains spirit works its mysteries on young grace as well , who is lifted from her grand funk under the influence of the sensitive horseman and the kindness of the extended family of ranchers she has grown to respect . redford seems to have chosen the subject to venerate a way of life which is fading under the sway of the large corporations : the spirit of the independent cowboys who appear so remote from the attractions of the big city that they might be living on mars . they are contrasted with what passes for civilization by some clever , homespun dialogue . told that a new york woman has come to spend time in montana , frank booker ( chris cooper ) , tom s brother , suggests " mixed salads . . . new york women like mixed salads " --as he and his family dig into their robust dinner of meat , mashed potatoes and thickly-buttered bread . the bookers seem to amaze grace and annie momentarily when they recite a quiet prayer just before digging into their spread , though frank s down-home wife diane ( dianne wiest ) , not wholly satisfied by her life , wistfully suggests that she would like to travel to morocco . yet another jarring difference between montana and manhattan emerges when annie s cell phone goes off , alarming the horse whom tom is struggling to tame . a city dweller could scarcely imagine tom s patience when in one incident , as pilgrim runs away from his corral , the horse is captivated by the patient tom who simply sits on the grass and stares at the animal for hours as if to say " it s your decision . " you come away from the movie with a more visceral understanding of why kevin bacon and peter fonda spend most of their time on their montana ranches and why redford would choose to live in utah , spending only a fraction of his year in new york . redford s is a west of marlboro men who don t smoke , rough-and tumble cowpokes who don t curse , and squeaky-clean kids who say " ma am " and " thank you " and are genuinely involved in the chores on their ranch . in short it s about home , perhaps the most important word in the english language . in redford s terms happiness belongs to those who have found it . scarlett johansson provides us with a believable performance of a fun-loving girl who , like her cherished equine , turns bratty from a serious injury but who has become wholly rehabilitated under the guidance of a considerate man . kristin scott thomas effectively bares her conflict between a devotion to her dependable and loving husband and her passion for a westerner who is firmly rooted to his place and its history . robert redford continues to amaze . this sixty- year old , impossibly handsome actor will probably continue playing square-jawed , sky-eyed , lonely heroes well into his eighties , and we don t wonder that after seeing the movie " indecent proposal , " a young man in the audience who said to his date : " would you sleep with him for a million dollars ? " gets the reply from the sweet young thing , " sure : but you ll have to give me some time to raise the money . " rated pg-13 . running time : 164 minutes . ( c ) harvey karten 1998 '
positiveC,' writer : scott b . smith ( based on his novel ) starring : bill paxton , billy bob thornton , bridget fonda , brent briscoe , chelcie ross , becky ann baker , jack walsh , gary cole it s been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it s been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly . i d saw that it s been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i m hardly comparing " a simple plan " to , say , " rear window " or " strangers on a train . " yet it s almost as good . it s simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral . elegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , " a simple plan " concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . without anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don t flaunt anything they don t want to flaunt , they ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton . the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . " a simple plan , " though borrows a little from each of these . a little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . but , as austin powers would say , that s not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . what i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it s successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . in one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn t look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) . instead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton s face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . there s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he s committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching . in short , probably the best piece of direction raimi s ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch " persona "  s " sex scene " and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman s ever done ) . but the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . there s at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don t come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror . during the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra " they can t do this , can they ? " streeming through my head . in fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen s [superior , but forget about it] " fargo , " has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then again , after seeing the " evil dead " films , i d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed " raimi " moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) . instead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . most particularly , billy bob thornton s character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . his dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we re not totally laughing at him . the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real . jacob s a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . the final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he s ever given and further proof that he s the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don t believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in " primary colors , " a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn t been in the same year ) because he s easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . he brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it s difficult picturing anyone else in the role . the rest of the cast is great too , from paxton s declining working man to chelcie ross  amiable town sheriff . even fonda shows off her talents nicely . and if i had any complaints about the film , it s that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . and the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you re trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn t raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . and , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . i won t reveal it , but it s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn t already too much of that anyway . for a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . imagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it s like if in " crime and punishment " if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i m at all comparing " a simple plan " to dostoevsky . the ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . but despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece .

positiveC,' you ve got mail works alot better than it deserves to . in order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it s body ( it s basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) . essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking . it s overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative . but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is . but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle . it couldn t have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman . i haven t quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you ve got mail , but then again , is that really important ? if you like something so much , why even question it ? again , the storyline is as cliched as they come . tom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children s book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner . fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business . little do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person s true identity . the rest of the story isn t important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen . sure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship . all of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax . but as foreseeable as the ending is , it s so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does . when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling . * homepage at http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/boulevard/7475 * * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas at http : //www . movie-tickets . com '

" " great expectations " opens somewhere in 1970s florida ( the original story is set in 19th-century england ) , as eight-year-old finn ( jeremy james kissner ) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future . there s icy , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beaudene ) , a pseudo-playmate of finn s ; ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , estella s auntie who s quite off-kilter over a past romance that never took off ; and a mysterious prisoner ( robert de niro ) whom finn saves the life of . finn , who lives with his sister s affable boyfriend ( lone star s chris cooper ) , fancies himself an aspiring artist , and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms . dinsmoor s lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion . flash forward into the  90s ( after a brief stop in the  80s ) , and finn ( now played by ethan hawke ) , despondent over a strange hot-and-cold relationship with the elusive estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor ; it s enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art . there , finn seems to gain everything he could ever want -- wealth , prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world . when estella resurfaces -- albeit with an aloof fiancé ( hank azaria ) -- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction . but she s not the only ghost from finn s past that s going to be paying him a visit . comparisons with the afore-mentioned " romeo + juliet " seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting . " great expectations " is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where " romeo " was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both . the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki s sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that s steamier than the film s ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes . the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik . acting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay s occasional slip-ups . hawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from " gattaca " ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy . paltrow s estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped . while the actress is at her icily seductive best , we re not told very much about her character , and as a result , it s often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we don t quite understand why she s fueling his fire . robert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft , a macabre , throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous . alfonso cuaron s visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie s climax . another problem is predictability ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren t familiar with the story . despite its script flaws , though , " great expectations " is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy . and frankly , it s nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality . perhaps that renovated release date , awfully close to valentine s day , will end up helping " great expectations "   seemingly average box office chances after all . © 1998 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/ '
positiveC,' more movie views by jamey hughton at : http : //welcome . to/movieviewsthe thomas crown affair , a remake of the 1968 steve mcqueen romance of the same name , is a glossy star vehicle with an attractive surface but an empty shell . while you will probably enjoy the star chemistry , the film lacks a certain urgency . and those expecting present 007 pierce brosnan to be dodging explosions and attempting death-defying stunts should look elsewhere . this remake follows a more laid-back and conventional pace , but it still can be fun . brosnan plays a wealthy art lover named thomas crown who steals expensive paintings because , well , he likes to . his latest heist has aroused some suspicion . after an ingeniously crafted caper in a museum involving a group of hired goons and a decoy helicopter , the insurance company sends in a representative by the name of catherine banning ( rene russo ) to investigate . banning , with a striking fashion sense and a very floppy hairdo , manages to piece together the heist in a few brief moments of scanning the video surveillance . but the identity of the ( very bright ) burglar is still unanswered . working with detective michael mccann ( denis leary ) , banning works fast . she attends a party uninvited , wearing a very revealing dress , and gets to know mr . crown a little better . she knows this debonair businessman is the thief , but she can t find the evidence to prove it . the chemistry between brosnan and russo in this film is not a noticeable strong point . they work well enough on an individual basis , but don t create enough believable sparks together to make their relationship click properly . pierce brosnan perhaps wasn t the best actor to take over for steve mcqueen , because he s lacking more than a few striking attributes that the latter was known for . but his performance is slick enough to hide these drawbacks . russo s role , also maybe better suited to a different actress , is still the stronger one . she has never looked better . perhaps casting wasn t the most persuasive part of the thomas crown affair , but the actors are in top form . the 2nd act of this film struggles valiantly to hold the viewer s attention . the director is john mctiernan , who is far more accustomed to helming big-budget action films ( he was behind the camera for die hard and predator ) . perhaps it s his direction , but most of the thomas crown affair feels somewhat stiff . the actors and scenery are pretty , the set-up is well staged , but there is little push behind the initial story . everything seems to meander along slowly until the last fifteen minutes , which contain just enough clever twists and turns to keep us interested . if there had been more focus on this sneaky little fun , the majority of the plot could have moved smoother ( the opposite goes for entrapment , which was fun and exciting but rarely stopped to establish character details ) . the presence of denis leary as the bickering detective helps . leary is a gifted comic actor who adds some zest to the story , although i did want more from his character . there s also faye dunaway , the original insurance investigator in the 1968 version , playing crown s psychiatrist and having fun doing so . inserting dunaway in more than just a brief cameo appearance was another wise move . little additions like this one can prove very effective when carefully scattered throughout a movie . an action film this ain t . the thomas crown affair is more like a long-shot romance with a detailed back story to support it . it has a tendency to be very entertaining , but the lack of a real 2nd act nearly sinks it . the actors are charming , but can t scrounge up enough sparks to keep the momentum flowing . this film has a great opening , a memorable finale , but what s left in-between leaves something to be desired .

positiveC,' jackie brown ( 1997 ) rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and offensive dialogue . starring : pam grier , samuel l . jackson , michael keaton , bridget fonda , robert de niro , robert forster , and chris tucker quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers . after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs . john travolta made his come-back and is now one of today s most bankable stars . bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor . jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier . most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she s never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls ) . that is , until now . jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction . after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing . jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment . despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another . pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l . jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster . more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations . describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can t say much or you spoil it for everyone else . i will tread lightly . jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport . the camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation . we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers . . . for a hefty price . ms . brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away . however , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l . a . cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money . they try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell s buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead . they try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing . but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell s friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail . ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops . after she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison . ordell doesn t like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track . this scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal . revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that s the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film . tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably . his hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way . they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends . of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise . and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop . of course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it . things are told from one person s perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more . this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side . on the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film . however , this time around it isn t as nearly as impressive or original . the writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino s use of slang terms offensive . the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it s much more easy to understand . his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the " leaps " in time . perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel " rum punch " by elmore leonard . the dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized . the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good . and as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s . the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable . the performances are incredibly rich , with hidden meaning behind every characters  actions . nothing is quite as it seems , and you can t really tell which side one person is on . the real treat , of course , is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown . her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which play an important role in the film . watching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i didn t know what she was thinking . her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought . bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato . i didn t even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham s in boogie nights ) . michael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen . chris tucker has a small , but effective performance . samuel l . jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . but no matter . . . jackson is very strong in his role . robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell s perspective clients and friends . robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters . he is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier . jackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks . as a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment , with a complex plot to draw viewers in . however , one can not help but compare it to tarantino s pulp fiction , and expect great results . when compared , it comes up short , but not that short . it s a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . i can t remember seeing her in anything ( except for a small role in mars attacks ! ) , but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one . expect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations ( and hopefully she will even be able to nab one ) . reviewed by

positiveC,' director : jonathan demme writers : akosua busia , richard lagravenese , and adam brooks ( based on the novel by toni morrison ) starring : oprah winfrey , danny glover , thandie newton , kimberly elise , beah richards , lisa gay hamilton , albert hall , irma p . hall since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they re portraying , it s fitting to say that " beloved " come as a real shock as a film . it s confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i ve seen all year , and that s not necessarily because of the three-hour running time . " beloved " is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , " beloved " comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) . " beloved " tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children . when the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family . sethe is proud , though , and will not move . her sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation . a couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging . he has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot . when he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies " it ain t evil . it s just sad . " some more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears . but when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house . her name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills . she stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk . they let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down . " beloved " acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story . most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts . sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , " they took my milk ! " worst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . she runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don t leave them alone . when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn t regret it . she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing . of course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren t flat out told that until later on in the film . beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long . thus , " beloved " becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , " solaris , " where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system . that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely . " beloved " moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable . the most interesting films are the ones that don t explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense . sethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she s being played by oprah winfrey . it s been well over a decade since her last major performance in " the color purple , " but judging from these two films , i ll bet she s one of the best actresses working today . . . if she was strictly an actress . her talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that s a shame because she brings so much to this movie . emotion . sadness . strength . watching the strong sethe , who s so afraid of the past that she s built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great . she makes it real . that s not to say this is a perfect film . in fact , i d wager to say that the fact that it s confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is . while oprah s performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn t show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film . it doesn t necessarily move as though they re memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . but despite its tediousness , perhaps that s the point . the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . and for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . jonathan demme s direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters . there s more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism . the acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . everyone has been raving about thandie newton s performance , and how it should be rewarded . however , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part . act like a baby . throw things . stumble around . chew food with your mouth open . i do think there s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it s kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother s loss of reality towards the end . it s not that newton isn t great : she s as annoying and wacky as the role demands . it s just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better . despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , " beloved " has still not done well . costing , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two . unfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic " caligula , " the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) . although i respect " beloved , " i can t say that i really enjoyed it .

positiveC,' bulworth ( m ) . ( twentieth century fox ) director : warren beatty stars : warren beatty , halle berry , oliver platt , don cheadle , joshua malina , jack warden , paul sorvino , christine baranski , richard sarafian , isaiah washington , sean astin , laurie metcalf , amiri baraka , wendell pierce , michele morgan , ariyan johnson , larry king , george hamilton ( uncredited cameo ) running time : 108 minutes . bulworth is a daring film from warren beatty , a film maker whose politics have always been left of centre and whose long career has been driven by his very personal choice of projects . in this cynical and scathing political satire beatty tackles many of the more obvious problems of the american democratic process , and the social and economic divisions caused by race and class . beatty , who is credited as writer , producer and director , takes aim at a number of targets and hits a few raw nerves along the way . beatty could also be accused of biting the hand that feeds him , as he attacks the major motion picture studios , the corporations that buy political favours , and the whole political process itself . in the week before the senate elections , democrat jay bulington bulworth ( beatty ) has become disillusioned by the hypocrisy , the lies and the machinations of american politics and wants out . he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy and then hires a hit man to assassinate him . freed of any sense of obligation , bulworth then feels able to speak his mind during the campaign . rather than deliver the same tired old speeches , he begins to tell the truth , informing the voters of how little they actually mean to the politicians . suddenly , bulworth becomes popular and reinvents himself as that rarity - an honest , straight talking politician . in the wave of euphoria following his sensational admissions , bulworth has second thoughts about his earlier decision , but finds himself unable to call off the hit . bulworth also finds romance with the fiery , beautiful and intelligent nina ( halle berry , from executive decision , etc ) , who hails from la s black ghettos and the opposite end of the political spectrum . however , her ideas and opinions open his eyes to a lot that is wrong with his country and the government . another unexpected source of inspiration is found in l d ( don cheadle , from devil in a blue dress , etc ) , a drug lord . bulworth follows on from those other sharp political satires from last year , the timely wag the dog and primary colors . however , bulworth is nowhere near as clever , biting or as credible as those two films , and at times is something of an undisciplined mess . as co-writers , beatty and long time collaborator jeremy pikser ( reds , etc ) seem to have bitten off more than they can chew in this ambitious script . there are a couple of good ideas here , but they seem to get lost in some unnecessary over plotting . the film ultimately lacks a strong central focus . and those scenes where bulworth , an angry old man , proceeds to rail against corruption and apathy through rap songs don t quite convince . for once , beatty is playing closer to his age , a haggard , weary and tired 60 something , and he seems to be enjoying the experience . oliver platt gives a wonderfully manic performance as murphy , bulworth s increasingly frustrated aide who attempts damage control as he tries to keep his charge on the straight and narrow . a number of celebrity cameos , from the ubiquitous larry king through to george hamilton , add to the flavour of the film . despite its structural flaws though , bulworth looks great , thanks to vittorio storaro s superb cinematography and dean tavoularis  production design .

positiveC,' before entering " the haunting " , it s important for the viewer to consider what kind of movie they re looking for . if it s a terrifying horror movie , look elsewhere . if it s a special effects extravaganza with fine acting and some of the best sets ever seen , this is the movie to see . it should also be noted that as a remake of the chilling original , the film is not quite up to par . if taken on its own merits however , this is a rather fun , brainless summer movie . dr . david marrow is a professor whose speciality is fear . taking a group of subjects consisting of the timid eleanor ; the perky , gorgeous theo , and the goofy owen , he travels to hill house . hill house is a tremendous mansion in the middle of nowhere which has a rather checkered past ( i don t want to say more , as further explanation would be a spoiler ) . dr . marrow does not , however , tell the group that they are there to examine the effects of fear . they are supposedly there to cure the insomnia experienced by the group . upon reaching the house , it slowly dawns on the three , and eventually on dr . marrow , that the house is indeed haunted , and out for their blood . the house seems to take a special interest in eleanor . as the nights go by , the house becomes more and more dangerous . i was rather disappointed at the bad reviews this recieved ( except from the always reliable roger ebert ) . so many critics seemed to grade this based entirely on how it compared to the original . if viewed on its own merits , i found this to be quite an enjoyable film . the acting is quite good , although the characters really are underwritten . the standout in my opinion is liam neeson , but i ve always been a fan of his . the one person i was not so impressed by was lili taylor , though she seems to be receiving all the praise from other critics . owen wilson does get a little annoying at times , but for the most part he adds some neccesary comic relief . the greatest part of this film is amazingly not the visuals , though they are impressive . it is the house itself , that steals the show . filled with long , dark corridors which seem to lead to nowhere , and are filled with chilling ( and sometimes moving ! ) statues , the house is truly awe inspiring . the fireplace , and its possible denizens , is one of the few truly frightening parts of the film . this brings us to the flaws , and there are quite a few of them . as i mentioned before , the characters are very underwritten . we know nothing about dr . marrow , theo , or owen , and very little about eleanor . the dialagoue is , at times , positively abysmal . for example , liam neeson climbs a very rickety flight of stairs to help an apparently suicidal eleanor . the stairs collapse , all over the place , and owen points at them , open mouthed saying " look , the stairs are falling . " my only other really major complaint is the film s end , which was really quite terrible . eleanor confronts the evil spirit in a huge ( but strangely disappointing ) special effects event , while spouting out some sort of strange speech about family values ! as i stated earlier , do not see this film if you want a terrifying horror movie . it simply doesn t inspire much fear . however , i do reccomend it simply to see the amazing , bone chilling sets . for this , some fine visual effects , and some good acting , " the haunting " earns three and a half stars . * * * * * - one of the greatest movies ever made , see it now . * * * * - great flick . try and catch this one . * * * - okay movie , hits and misses . * * - pretty bad . see it if you ve got nothing better to do . * - one of the worst movies ever . see it only if you enjoy pain . e-mail with comments at : jabii@aol . com '
positiveC,' director : adrian lyne writer : stephen schiff ( based on the novel by vladimir nabokov ) starring : jeremy irons , dominique swain , melanie griffith , frank langella much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of " lolita , " made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it s important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit . when seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation . . . well , you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution . what s even worse is that seeing this " lolita , " especially the first time and if you re familiar with anything " lolita , " is admittingly very anticlimactic . this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it s really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : " flashdance , " " fatal attraction , " and " indecent proposal " ) , at least besides " jacob s ladder . " i ve seen this " lolita " twice : the first time , i wasn t so blown away . it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting . the second time , not really thinking about how i ve waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i m seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally . the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it s such a good novel , and why this is such a good film . the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it s not trash for the perverted but because it s about human obsession with things that are out of one s reach . its protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies . the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can t live without . these ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating . the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized . the tone of the book is a comical one , but it s also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective . humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed . we get a sense that perhaps it s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed . he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita . he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her . the story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace . the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him . the opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn t done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn t possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general . in that film , he used the traps of society as benefits . the studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and when you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession . the censors wouldn t allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through . looking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we ve read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it s really impossible to compare them . they both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was . and although it s true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it s unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse . i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won t say that here . however , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it . it doesn t have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had . some of that is in the casting of the two leads . jeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert . he s droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does . he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience . and when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he s her prisoner for as long as he lives . and dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible . she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character . it s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time . when he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her . there are two other minor characters in the film , one who s a road block in the beginning , and the other who s a reappearing threat to the relationship . the former is charlotte , lolita s mother , played by melanie griffith . in the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish . and she s the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning . as played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she s about half of them . it s annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first . and even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she s nothing more . the other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price . langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original . quilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk . langella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of what we thought of him . as you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise . this version is beautiful , and perpetually saddening . the camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich . the acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita . more importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it . by the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn t regret , we feel that we all lose to something we can never have .

positiveC,' the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80 s . more practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director s chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film . alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation . in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970 s . ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . ) this story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco . the film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband s suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier . they hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on . to reveal any more of the story would be unfair . suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english . bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento . her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora s troubled soul . the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd-sounding 70 s rock with classic gothic piano sequences . and there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair . yet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal . lamberto bava and francesco barbieri s script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap . scholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential .

positiveC,' nosferatu : the first vampire   -by bill chambers ( wchamber@netcom . ca ) ( life is harsh ; your website shouldn t be . http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/set/7504 aka film freak central ) starring max schreck , gustav von wangenheim , greta schroder , john gottowt written by henrik galeen directed by f . w . murnau available in an all new video edition from arrow entertainment ( $29 . 95 ) , with an introduction by david carradine , written & produced by wayne j . keeley f . w . murnau s career ended sadly and prematurely . the german director of such classics as " sunrise " and " the last laugh " died in a car accident shortly after signing a deal to make american pictures at paramount . murnau was reportedly a giant man , well over six feet , a towering figure probably incapable of anything but a grand entrance . which brings us to " nosferatu : a symphony of horror " : surely he felt a kinship with his title character , the looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck ; in one of the most indelible images in film history , silent or otherwise , schreck rises from his grave , gnarled hands outstretched , and he s so big that part of his head is cropped by the top of the frame . the plot of " nosferatu . . . " is lifted--unauthorized--from bram stoker s " dracula " . the british hutter is an eager real estate man assigned to visit and discuss future living arrangements with count orlock of transylvania . he leaves behind girlfriend emily , only to discover orlock s secret--he s a bloodsucker--and struggle to return to england before the nosferatu reaches his lady love . in addition to schreck s performance , the cinematography and effects are outstanding . arrow video s digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixed-coffin . the cover art features a red-tinted , hairy , goateed vampire staring straight at you , his fanged mouth agape , while the bodies of two sexy , writhing women entice you below . trouble is , murnau s monster is pale-faced , bald , pointy-eared , and non-goateed , and there isn t a single sexy , writhing woman to be found in his movie . this sort of misleading packaging makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in the film from which cool cover art could have been extracted . additionally , notifying the viewer that this is in fact murnau s film seems like afterthought since his name and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire . that said , a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself . the original elements are not in the best condition--non-studio silents were unlucky in their preservation-- so we re still dealing with a slightly washed out , scratched , jittering image . but at least the day and night scenes are tinted sepia and blue , respectively , especially helpful to an audience who may question nosferatu s waltzing around during what seems like sunlight ( it took a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties ) . the title cards have been redone , and they are legible , accurate , and digitally altered to flicker--a very nice touch . ( even the opening copyright warning flickers ! ) the score has been replaced by music from type o negative , a hard-rock group , arguably gothic , and their songs underscore the film nicely-- certainly the coolest video a band can ask for . when our hero , hutter , first steps onto the doomed carriage to count orlock s castle , we hear a well-timed " now you re dead ! " from lead singer peter steele . david carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host ; he fiddles with a blade and cane while introducing the film . after the feature , which runs about 63 minutes , is included a new music video from type o negative , the black-and-white fang-fest " black no . 1 " . of course , " nosferatu : a symphony of horror " is the main attraction , and while my latest viewing raised questions ( why is the woman called emily in the title cards but " mina " --as bram stoker called her--in hutter s letters ? , for instance ) , it made me realize how much this movie has inspired and been stolen from . coppola s 1992 " bram stoker s dracula " owes a great stylistic debt to murnau s masterpiece , but the one thing it couldn t thieve was the original s abstract charms . this latest incarnation from arrow will probably- -like the rescored " metropolis " a few years back--turn a silent film into more palpable entertainment for the latest generation of film freaks .

positiveC,'  there seem to be two reactions to dark city . you either love it or you are unimpressed . count me as a " love it . " as good as the crow and spawn are , dark city is better . where the former two have a specific comic-book following , the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal . it has a similar look to the others , but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent . not clever or complex , the story is still fascinating , like a selection from the twilight zone . a man ( rufus sewell ) is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe . surprised , the attacker runs off . the dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a woman s body in the room . a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately , so he packs some clothes and leaves , never sure why he s leaving or what he s fleeing . ghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city , hounding him like figures in a nightmare . an odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i . d . the amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch . now if only he could remember the rest of his life . . . . dark city is good on many levels . first , the look of the movie is excellent . give credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements . there are visual elements from the american 1920s-60s , mixed with dickens-era urban industrial elements . it is all pulled together in a sad , dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper s painting , nighthawks . proyas  use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film s world ( for not only does the audience see the city a model , but so do the ghouls ) . the look is like a cross between tim burton s batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay . second , the editing of the film is good . the pacing is on track , and the plot is revealed , the " amnesia " explained , in satisfying increments . also , the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense , caffeinated look . third , the special effects are well used . they look good , but more importantly , the right effects are used for the right job . one example stands out in my mind : the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically . a simple ripple effect is used . a more showy effect could have been chosen , but then it would have just been gratuitous . restraint was shown where necessary , letting the more critical effects look more impressive . finally , like gattaca , dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance . unlike gattaca , the story is just open-ended and non-literal enough to be successful . john murdoch s recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night , and the hopeful coming of the dawn . his struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind ( at least in his world ) . when we finally see the big picture of the movie s world , it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of a giant turtle . a few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave , but i do strongly recommend it , for its look , its pace , its story , and its timelessness . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes/ '

" rat race " is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness . hands down , this is the most fun film of the summer . the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a  60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen . then comes the setup . donald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients . to that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines . gathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , " today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six . " the competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash . there is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead . the race has no rules  whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money . since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let s use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers . decked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby . she finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life . thrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature . owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america . an nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game . after escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention . mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america . he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times . pollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation . randy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas . fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview . beverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert . brothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid . blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him . the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal . finally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey . at first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman . director jerry zucker ( " airplane , " " ghost " ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers . as with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps . high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off . had i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby s clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation . i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence . my god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing " all star ? " but enough carping . " rat race " is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast . see it , see it again and when the dvd comes out , buy it , because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for .

" as good " also stars jack nicholson , in top para-satanic and aggressive form , circumflex eyebrows , hooded eyes ranking with the best ( victor mature s , bob mitchum s ) , incongruous tan for a new yorker ( but no one yet has ever been able to challenge the deep bronzing of douglas fairbanks , sr ) and his bag of eccentricities at an apex . the movie has both originality and well-crafted , deja-filmed mainstream appeal . peripherally , it is a distant variant on beauty and the beast , the taming of the shrew ( with sexes reversed ) . centrally , it is a showcase for the talents of nicholson and helen hunt . melvin udall ( nicholson ) is a misanthropic , bilious , hypochondriac , reclusive mega-nut . his manias include always washing with a fresh cake of soap ; walking to the same restaurant daily at 11 am for a giga-cholesterol breakfast at " his " table served by " his " waitress ; bringing his own plastic knives and forks ; wearing disposable surgical gloves ; avoiding brushing against people or stepping on sidewalk cracks . all of this , plus more quirks , is apparently explained by his suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder . that s bad enough , but melvin is a pain in every other way too . he s a champion people-insulter and , among other lovely traits , homophobic , african-american-fearing , and a jew-and-everybody-else equal opportunity hater . this includes animals . the action begins with mel ( who probably hates his parents for his name ) throwing his neighbor s beloved pooch verdell down the laundry chute . the neighbor , simon ( kinnear ) is a successful painter , whose art dealer friend is a classy african-american named with originality frank sachs ( gooding ) . both are gay , but not that you could tell . the other major " dramatis persona " is carol ( hunt ) , mel s habitual , suffering , and onlywaitress acceptable to mel at the restaurant . she is a single mother with a dangerously asthmatic boy , lives with him her mother ( knight ) in far-off brooklyn , trudging to and fro exhausted by her waitressing and her motherly duties . when simon is brutally beaten up by invading , thieving street hoods , and taken to the hospital , frank sticks mel with the dog in a way that mel cannot refuse . predictably , grudgingly ( and unconvincingly ) , the writer and the canine fall for each other . did i say " writer " ? yes , that s what mel does for a living , composing romances for female readership and making lots of money from his 62 or so purple-prose novels . the contrast between his profession and his character is absurd , rates an f for credibility . mel explains his knowing portrayals of women by : " i think of a man , then i take away reason and accountability . " this adds gynecophobia to the list , makes us think of mel as a virgin ( ? ? ! ! ) and simply won t wash . upon his return from the hospital , simon finds himself broke : he has no health insurance ( a real tragedy for so many self-employed ) , his medical bill is over $60 , 000 , his art has been vandalized , his will to paint has vanished , he is losing his apartment . but look what animal companionship can do for people ! increasingly human and humane mel comes to the rescue . and by some intricate plot devices , he also delivers carol and her son from the evil of uncaring doctors and medical bills . it s artificial plotting but while you are watching it , it is also warm , lovely and well-acted . all the while , of course , mel is falling for carol . but the new mel dies hard . when he introduces his friends to one another he says : " carol the waitress . simon the fag . " i ll stop here . nicholson , in spite of his improbable role , is nicholson , meaning as good as ever , even better perhaps . no surprise here . the real revelation is helen hunt . i have never cared much for her flimsy , parts in tv s " mad about you , " and while she has many more credits , too many of them were in unmemorable productions . she was finally top-listed in her previous film " twister " ( 1996 ) , but her role was pallid . now finally helen hunt has come into her own . without bravura or pointedly dramatic or humorous scenes and repartees , without prettifying makeup or sexy clothes , without scene-stealing episodes , hunt does steal the whole movie . in one of the most amazing transformations in recent cinema , she makes palpable her struggle with life and conditions , her exhaustion as waitress , caring mom , commuter and debtor in splendidly veristic ways . we learn nothing about the father of her child , or for that matter about the earlier carol , yet she is three-dimensional both in her sadness , depression , lack of men in her life as well as in her moments of humor and happiness . cannily , the script adds rounding off carol through a funny-turning-unfunny interlude with a lover who vanishes . aged beyond her 34 years , not especially pretty by ordinary standards , she is enormously likable , appealing , real and , yes , even sexy . she also strikes very believably at hmos and the medical profession , though the " deus ex machina " introduction of a wise , wonderful doctor restores some balance . yet , what with simon s lack of insurance , a strong case is made against our health system . multiple oscar-winning writer-director-producer brooks had previously directed " terms of endearment , " " broadcast news " and the notorious " i ll do anything , " which , filmed as a musical , failed in previews and had to come out as a non-musical . even so , the latter is my favorite brooks movie , partly because of its superb direction of actors . now brooks repeats his tour-de-force with helen hunt . no matter how iffy the tale , the performances make it a winner .

( which is key to the conclusion s said ambiguity ) . the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first , self-consciously " quirky " ; the introductory scenes are a chore . these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion , a belief in themselves , and because they have long-term goals ; henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner , but they aren t pop slackers . the story is rather classical : the tutor is a better talker than a doer , raised on books ; the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of . ( shades of film school . . . ) the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small , and the final third does test one s patience , yet henry fool is tight , hardly excessive in its length . how refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character . and unless i nodded off , not a single building exploded . this , hartley s seventh feature , is contemplative about " the artist " ; fortunately , we never get a sampling of simon s work , and it s a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers  pens .

positiveC,' this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated . there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood s most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story . this is the best we ve seen from disney since " beauty and the beast " ( 1996 ) . this film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story . in the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their " lives " . one day , andy broke woody s arm off , while playing with him . woody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards . later andy s mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son s room . since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back . although his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale . the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , " woody s roundup . " if he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit . so , after andy s mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it s up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend . and so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys . there are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) . meanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) . they offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan . he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations . the problem is , if woody escapes from al s clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage . a real effort is made in the technical department . the animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the " cinematography " is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression . lighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie s remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on " jurassic park " and " star wars " . the film ends with the " failed takes " , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv . these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film . but what in the end makes " toy story 2 " a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation . it is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself . it is not difficult to predict that " toy story 2 " would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected . unexpected because the first film wasn t much more than a demonstration of special effects . but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn t produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs . but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years . this is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation . off course , this is not " antz " , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you ll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have . whether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say . my choice would probably be " the iron giant " , but ( along side with " american pie " ) this is the comedy of the year . i almost lost my hopes for disney , but " toy story 2 " proves that disney hasn t lost their ability to entertain .

positiveC,' directed by bill condon . cast : ian mckellen , brendan fraser , lynn redgrave , lolita davidovich . 1998 - 106 minutes . rated r ( for profanity , brief nudity , and sexual situations ) . reviewed january 8 , 1999 . bill condon s " gods and monsters " is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics " frankenstein " and " bride of frankenstein . " since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale s inner fantasies and hallucinations . whale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . as the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . james whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , " a dirty old man . " in one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale s home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . because of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . clayon agrees , and doesn t really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . certainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . " gods and monsters " is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a " motion picture director , " rather than a " horror director . " and in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . it is evident that whale s first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . as played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . he never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . although boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people s homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . since whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . although an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the " on-again-off-again " friendship at the film s center is fairly predictable . we know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . in lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . also , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . if the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . " gods and monsters " is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . walking away from " gods and monsters , " it was ian mckellen s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . it is a sad testament when a person s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else s business in the first place . - copyright 1999 by dustin putman dustin putman s film haven  '
positiveC,' disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure , mulan . while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect , it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults . fa mulan ( ming-na wen , singing : lea salonga ) wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family . . . it s just that she doesn t quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time . while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles ) , mulan would prefer speaking her mind . but there is trouble on the horizon . the evil huns , led by shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) , are invading china . the emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army . the only male in mulan s family is her father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) , who , old and with a bad leg , honorably accepts his fate . mulan , on the other hand , decides to save her father s life . . . by secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield . mulan , under the assumed name of ping , appears at camp where she , along with the other bumbling recruits , yao ( harvey fierstein ) , chien-po ( jerry tondo ) and ling ( gedde watanabe ) , are trained in the art of war by captain shang ( b . d . wong , singing : donny osmond ) . but she s not alone in her tasks . . . in typical disney fashion , she has three animal companions : her horse khan , a lucky cricket crickey , and a pint-sized " guardian " dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy ) . much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame , the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn t flow well with the rest of the more serious story . sure , some occasional comic relief is welcome , particularly in a film geared for the younger set , but mulan overdoes it . the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good , but schizophrenic experience . but , that commentary aside , this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable ) . the animation is on par with some of disney s best . the story itself is interesting , and the action scenes are awe-inspiring . the musical score to the film is enjoyable , though , as has been the case with disney s recent work , the songs are mostly forgettable . at least , we re only subjected to four of them this time around . mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date . most of the killing is off-screen and it s all highly depersonalized ( there s nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi s mom ) . there s nothing graphic , and the film resides snugly inside a g rating . children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies . it s ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition . if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor , ax the compulsory songs , and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance , they could have had a classic on their hands . instead , they merely deliver a very good time at the movies .

positiveC,' susan granger s review of " the perfect storm " ( warner bros . ) " more people die on fishing boats , per capita , than working in any other job in the u . s . . every journey a fishing boat makes can be an all-or-nothing risk . it is life at its most exhilarating and its most terrifying , " says director wolfgang petersen ( " das boot " ) . and that s just what he captures in this true story of struggle and humanity aboard a swordfishing boat , the andrea gail , sailing out of gloucester , massachusetts , in late october , 1991 . early in bill wittliff s screenplay , based on sebastian junger s best-seller , we meet the crew of six . the veteran captain ( george clooney ) is frustrated because he can t find fish on the grand banks , yet a rival skipper ( mary elizabeth mastrantonio ) brings in huge hauls . his right-hand man ( mark walhberg ) needs money to build a new life with his girl-friend ( diane lane ) . there s a devoted dad ( john c . reilly ) with an estranged wife and son , a free-spirited jamaican ( allen payne ) , a lonely guy ( john hawkes ) , and a last-minute replacement with a bad attitude ( william fichtner ) . the skipper s convinced he can change his bad luck streak in remote flemish cap , and he does . but then trouble begins . there s a rogue wave , a man overboard and the ice machine breaks - with 60 , 000 lb . of fish that could spoil . but that s minor compared with a deadly monster storm approaching which a boston meteorologist describes as " a disaster of epic proportions " that also threatens the lives of a coast guard helicopter rescue team trying to save three people stranded on a sailboat on the high seas . it s formulaic and there are cliches , but the walls of water , created by fluid dynamics simulating real-life phenomena , are awesome . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the perfect storm " is a terrifying , suspenseful 8 . hang on for the white-knuckle thrill ride of the summer !

positiveC,' columbia / 1 : 52 / 1997 / pg-13 ( language , violence , sex , brief nudity ) cast : ethan hawke ; uma thurman ; jude law ; gore vidal ; alan arkin ; loren dean ; elias koteas ; xander berkeley ; jayne brook ; tony shalhoub director : andrew niccol screenplay : andrew niccol " gattaca " represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science-fiction films -- it s a genre picture that doesn t rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story . the movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction . this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they d like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects . those made the old-fashioned way are labeled as " in-valids " and confined to the lower rung of society . vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) is one such person , born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish-molded younger brother anton . fed up with being second-rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space , vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation . everyday , he watches as " superior " folk make his fantasy a reality . determined to do the same , vincent meets a dna broker ( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo ) who sells fake identities to in-valids . his counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow ( jude law ) , an ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life . for a price and the promise of a caretaker , jerome supplies vincent with his identity , as well as blood , skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card . because of his drastically improved status , vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca , and catches the eye of comely co-worker irene ( uma thurman ) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect , she s enamored by his flawless persona she doesn t know is a lie . but on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure , the mission director is murdered . two ardent detectives ( alan arkin and billy bathgate s loren dean ) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca , and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of vincent s eyelashes -- threatens to blow vincent s cover and derail his goal . even if " gattaca " were dramatically empty , it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials -- the film s look is dazzling without ever being flashy . first-time director/writer andrew niccol ( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama " the truman show " ) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish ; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak , production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy , retro ambiance . an opening credits sequence -- where skin , nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily . niccol even utilizes voice-over narration ( a device almost always poorly-employed ) in an effective way . when it comes to acting , the movie is also flawless . ethan hawke does magnificent work , proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level . his chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side , but needfully so , adding to the setting s clinical chill . as the bitter jerome , jude law has a star-making presence , and it s his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core . in " gattaca "  s series of final shots , the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other , and the effect is sad , lyrical and beautiful . things get a little strange as the movie nears its climax , when vincent s relationship with his brother comes back into view . the big dramatic culmination is a swim race , which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed . still , the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop -- it s successful sci-fi without showy special effects , it s a crisp thriller with character-driven thrills , it s a futuristic fable without blood and guts . even its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot , ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage . although it s portrayal of the upcoming century is grim , " gattaca " serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film . © 1997 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/ '

" and what do you get in central station ? a hybrid ? not at all . you get an original , un-gimmicky , un-icky , un-cliched , attention-holding , touching film that opens your eyes on major aspects of the human condition in brazil and on that country s people and life . obviously , the movie has been appreciated , with awards and/or applause at several festivals , including the top prize at the berlin festival . it is also a contender in the best foreign film category at the 1999 oscars . rio de janeiro s central train station where 300 , 000 people move about each day , is a microcosm of urban society . the station looks to me ( but i may be wrong ) like the hub of local trains rather than long-distance travel . also , the majority of the people we see are working class , low income or no income cariocas , cheaply clad -- a far cry from the well-dressed crowds in north american commuter trains . ( to anticipate comments , i do know that , as i write this in cold february , it is 90 degrees in rio , and people are in shirt-sleeves , but shabbiness prevails at the station by any standards ) . the mobs are busy rushing into the trains . many younger men jump into the wagons through open windows . the place is also a hive of makeshift stores and stands . early into the movie there s a horrendous scene . a man who has lifted something from a shop is pursued . two cops catch up with him . they take his loot , and , without thinking twice about it , one of the lawmen puts a bullet in the fellow s head . nothing is made of this . life is cheap . dora , in her mid-to-late 60s , and no beauty --to put it mildly--is a retired elementary school teacher . to make ends meet , in the cavernous station she has a table on which she writes letters that many illiterates dictate to her and gets also paid for putting on stamps later and mailing the envelopes . but , tough , brusque and caustic , the scribe is also a scam artist . when she gets to her dismal apartment by the tracks , she brings along her daily bag of letters that she s supposed to mail , and shows them to her friend irene . irene may be her roommate or her neighbor , it s not clear . clearly though , she is the only friend in dora s depressing life . irene , younger , jolly and a still nice-looking fading beauty , is probably a prostitute , though this is not elaborated . at home , dora perhaps selects a few envelops that she mails . for sure , she tears up many of them and puts the rest in drawers , where they probably remain forever . among her customers is a woman with her 9-year old boy josue . her husband , a drunkard , left her long ago . she want him back , for herself and for their fatherless child . that woman is killed by a bus right outside the station . the plight of the child is even more tragic if you are aware of the horrendous problem of millions of street-children in brazil . their survival is a tragedy ; many even get killed by the police for no reason . soon , hard-as-nails dora takes streetwise and sullen josue to her place . her unexpected kindness is undone when she sells the boy to a shabby " agency " which supposedly supplies children to adoptive parents abroad . dora returns home with a new color tv set , on which , with subtle , symbolic , irony , we see only black-and-white programs . but an aghast irene tells her that the agency is a fake , that the kids will be killed for their organs . dora rushes back , kidnaps josue and in fear of retaliation , flees with him to look for the missing father . this is where the travels begin . it s more of a road movie than an odyssey since the " adventures " are on a small , intimate rather than a grand scale . the grand scale is only in the vastness of brazil , the world s fifth largest nation . the woman and the rebellious josue take a lot of busses . when hardly solvent or broke they hitch rides in trucks . most of this is in the " sertao " of the north east , brazil s thinly populated , often barren outback . ( it s a neat reversal of the poor of those areas trudging to the promised land of big cities ) . the trip , the landscape , the places seen are harsh . nothing is paved in this barrenness , except for the main highways . the viewers are given a tour which , like the entire film , is extremely well photographed and uncompromisnly realistic . we are light years away from the commonly pictured touristic brazil with its fiestas and the thong-wearing beauties of the copcabana beach . credit director salles s experience as a documentarist . he is objective but has a heart . while the protagonists gradually , as expected , draw closer to each other , salles , with much naturalness , avoids sentimentalizing people or places . yet his eyes and ears are full of quiet sympathy for what , to use bunuel s title , are los olvidados , the forgotten ones who struggle to subsist . the people whom the woman and the child come across , by and large are decent folks who live in squalor . an episode with a nice , warm , older trucker , an evangelical who , for a brief spell , stirs the woman in dora , is effortlessly touching . and in a long , spectacular sequence , dora and josue find themselves in a throng of pilgrims that go to revere jesus in acts of hope and of self-consolation . ( one should not , by the way , make too much of names such as josue ( joshua ) and jesus , the elusive father , nor the fact that jesus is a sort of carpenter . symbolism may be present , but with a light touch . curiously , in the other main candidate for best foreign film oscar this year ( life is beautiful ) the woman is called dora and the child is josue the humanity of the dora-josue twosome has enormous appeal . she is one of brazil s top stage actresses -- and light years away from the looks of sharon stone in gloria ! ) he was a poor shoeshine boy whom the director discovered in an airport . their performances are so real that the word " acting " never comes into your mind . what might come to mind is the great italian film " stolen children , " as well as its contrast with central station , whose poverty makes even the italian south look relatively wealthy . the most upsetting sight for me , one that encapsulates the movie , is the the picture of a goat in a sertao village . the animal , trying to graze in the barren dust , walks somehow with his two broken front legs . yet the total movie does not stress grimness . it has its natural quota of positiveness , even unforced humor .

positiveC,' that s the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into " the wedding singer , " the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus . does he draw laughs from his sad , puppy dog expression and don t-hate-me-for-being-a-simpleton observations ? or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people ? or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over ? well , there s a little bit of all of that in " the wedding singer " and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr . sandler s thing , i did have a surprisingly good time . that s because , in a nutshell , " the wedding singer " is one of the sweetest movies you re ever likely to come across . that s right . sweet . the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh-out-loud hysterical but the tone ? well , it s just lovely . i have to admit i was half-expecting farting armpit humor , gratuitous nudity , superfluous , cloying subplots , and some nasty , unnecessary violence . instead ? well , i ve said it before . sweet . the year is 1985 and sandler plays robbie hart , the eponymous wedding singer , a job aspiring rock stars often settle for . when robbie s fiancée dumps him at his own altar , robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia ( drew barrymore ) who has some problems of her own ( she s marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who , unbeknownst to her , isn t that big on monogamy ) . it isn t giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love . aww . . . sandler and barrymore are a good match and they re assisted by some terrific cameo appearances , including steve buscemi and jon lovitz , whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film . writer tim herlihy ( with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher ) keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion . it doesn t all work but it s handled with such light-heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans . herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights , sounds , and affectations of the 1980s . the soundtrack--an ever-present force in the film--is packed with wall-to-wall hits of the period , new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idol s " white wedding " to the smiths  " how soon is now ? " to culture club s " do you really want to hurt me ? " the mix of music and fashion would make " the wedding singer " a great double feature with " boogie nights . " if you grew up listening to the cure and a flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs , then " the wedding singer " is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride . if you re a fan of the lovable , laughable adam sandler , well . . . let s just say that " the wedding singer " might well be the only film in recent memory to make * me * want to rent " happy gilmore .

" later , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith . ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it s not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) director gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . there s an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric . likewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie s friendship . many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . matt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will . minnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it s refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . arguably the best dramatic work in the actor s career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams  portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . adequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) . like most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren t always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . good will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the " good " in the title .

positiveC,' this remake of " la cage aux folles " features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son s future in-laws . the couple ( robin williams and nathan lane ) are about as archetypal , or as the less kind might put it  stereotypical , gays possible . williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star . they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode . williams is excellent as should be no surprise . gene hackman as right-wing potential father-in-law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles . the real star is lane . his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight-shooting uncle is hilarious . perhaps it is a personal failing on my part , but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it . luckily ( for me at least ) , it doesn t last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men , their son and the deception . the question of stereotypes is a touchy one . these guys personify the homophobic gay image . you can almost hear the swishing . if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world , you ll be outraged . but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals , you ll love it . your choice .

positiveC,' capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen . one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse . the idea is something about ghosts and the internet . the film has an amazing apocalyptic style . rating : 7 ( 0 to 10 ) , + 2 ( -4 to + 4 ) perhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? ) filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa . his films all seem to have one style , bleak . the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold . little known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver . most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid . his 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with . cure is probably his classic . last year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon . that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story . pulse is kurosawa back on form . taguchi , a young computer expert , is late with his delivery of some important software . two co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment . taguchi , acting very strangely , lets his friends look for the missing software . meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain . when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself . if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall . taguchi s computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus . people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide . but they are not entirely dead . their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet . people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost . if they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow . the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist . this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing " like a computer disk . " instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses . there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers . leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death . this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work . it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death , but whatever it does convey is nightmarish . kurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion . frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact . his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange . junichiro hayashi , the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa s films , creates a dark , cold , and gloomy tone . images are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain . scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might . people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence . seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary . kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread . of any horror filmmaker in the world , kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch . i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a + 2 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

positiveC,' if there s one thing sandra bullock desperately needs , it s a decent script to get her career restarted . after a series of flops ( " speed 2 " , " forces of nature " ) , she needs a good script with a good costar . well , " gun shy " is a rather entertaining script , and she has the always great liam neeson as her costar , but there are two serious problems : first , the film was released at what could be the worst possible time , the same weekend as " scream 3 . second , sandra bullock appears in perhaps six scenes throughout the film . everyone finished gasping in disbelief ? that s right folks , despite what the previews may have led you to believe , " gun shy " is hardly a romantic comedy because there is seldom a female presence . the thing is , the film might be better as a result . charlie mayough ( liam neeson ) is an undercover dea officer who is on his last assignment before retirement . the problem is , he can t bring himself complete the assignment unless he constantly attends group therapy to keep his nerves under control . charlie s final assignment involves catching illegal funds on a group of mafia types , led by the uptight fulvio ( oliver platt ) . as a result of charlie s nerves , he s having another problem , which involves his , uh , bowles . well , he visits a proctologist named jane ( sandra bullock ) , who promises she can fix all his anxiety problems in two weeks by dating him . it s not very often that a romantic subplot feels quite so tacked on as it does here . bullock s character serves absolutely no purpose , other than to give charlie occasional words of encouragment and to solve his prostatic difficulties . in fact , if her character had been eliminated entirely and more of the film had focused on oliver platt and his cohorts , this probably would have been a much better film . speaking of oliver platt , he is a riot as a hit man who hates being made up entirely of cliches . the truth is , oliver platt makes this movie . liam neeson may be a great actor , but he isn t given much to work with here . platt , on the other hand , is given some truly great scenes . for example , near the start of the film , platt is seated across from a neighbor , telling him that in the middle east they chop the hands off thieves . he then prepares to do this to the neighbor for reasons we re not quite sure of , but it s hysterical when we find out . charlie s sessions with his therapy group are fairly amusing , particularly when he runs into one of them while on assignment . unfortunately , any other time when oliver platt is not on screen , things tend to drag some . we re also introduced to someone that may possibly be the most irritating character i ve seen in years . jason ( i believe played by andrew lauer ) is a big time wallstreet dealer , who shows up to invest the gangsters  money . he is about five foot ten , has an obnoxious , high pitched voice , and laughs insanely at everything . after seeing him on screen for about ten minutes , i really wanted to kill this character with my bare hands . i was tempted to knock a half star off my rating simply because he was present . the other supporting characters , while certainly eccentric , are more amusing than annoying . watch for an appearance by mitch pileggi , of x-files fame , as charlie s boss . the funny thing is , it s almost the exact same character he plays in " the x-files " . one last thing i must note is that i had a very hard time imagining a beautiful proctologist going out with one of her patients right after attending to him . i had an even harder time believing that charlie could have made it through the first date without constantly thinking about everything she had seen . " gun shy " is obviously not an incredible comedy . it is , however , an amusing , harmless little comedy that has has a lot of chuckles and a few true belly laughs . the film may only run 100 minutes , but things do tend to drag a bit by the end , which is drawn out well past what is needed . i d recommend the film to fans of liam neeson and oliver platt , but not to fans of sandra bullock , since there isn t much of her in it . i give it three and a half out of five stars .

positiveC,' if you re the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland , you re going to love the hunt for red october . you ll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics , or if you re a sean connery or alec baldwin fan , or if you admired director john mctiernan s earlier films , die hard and predator . in fact , the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book , since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them . the hunt for red october is an epic thriller , adapted from tom clancy s best selling novel . set in an era before glasnost , the movie revolves around a top-secret soviet submarine , called the red october . the nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system , which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection . the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius , played by sean connery . ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine , but he has other ideas . he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean . is he planning to start world war iii ? cia analyst jack ryan doesn t think so ; he s convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u . s . ryan , played by alec baldwin , is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub . the characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin , but the performances , thankfully , are rock solid . baldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor . sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery s somber first officer . it s ironic to see neil and connery playing russians , since they are both best known for their roles as british agents , connery as james bond and neil as reilly , " ace of spies . " the large cast also includes scott glenn , james earl jones , tim curry , and joss ackland , plus richard jordan as the smooth u . s . national security adviser . the special effects are remarkable , but more than anything , the hunt for red october is distinguished by its water-tight plot . screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns . they keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment . the movie doesn t get as sweaty or breathless as die hard , because it would rather tell a good story than hit you over the head with non-stop action . the finale is rousing and suspenseful , but essentially , the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler .

positiveC,' capsule : smart and compulsively watchable , if fanciful , thriller that employs the story of the jackal to good psychological effect . aidan quinn is worth admission . before the terrible bruce willis thriller the jackal hit theaters , a modestly-budgeted and far superior treatment of the same basic material came and went , with nary a whisper of promotion or even acclaim . too bad . the assignment is a far better movie -- not a classic , but it entertains and engrosses aptly -- which were two things the other movie couldn t do . the facts behind the story are now history : the jackal was the moniker used by a man named carlos , who apparently masterminded or at least spearheaded many of the most ( in ) famous terrorist actions in recent history . he , among others , ransomed the members of opec at gunpoint -- an incident which is recapped in the early minutes of this film . one of the cia men , henry fields ( donald sutherland ) , tries to get close enough to carlos to liquidate him with a " lead handshake " ( a gun in the sleeve ) , but his advisors collar him before he can pull it off . carlos vanishes with his captives . flash-forward . an american soldier , annibal ramirez ( aidan quinn ) , is yanked into custody by a mossad agent , amos ( ben kingsley ) . ramirez is a ringer for carlos ; there is some mountingly funny byplay when we realize that it s not carlos playing dumb , or even carlos playing the hotheaded american bit . this guy really is an american soldier , and he really is gonna sue amos into next wednesday when he gets home . fields introduces himself to annibal and ingratiates himself with him . they want carlos , and annibal is a great way for them to trap him . annibal wants nothing to do with any spy games , but after some unpleasant manipulation , they take him under their wing and begin remaking him into a ) a spy and b ) a psychological twin for carlos . they do a frighteningly good job . this is one of the best parts of the movie , where we see annibal s straight-arrow military persona being strip-mined and replaced with a grasping , selfish and amoral one -- all the better for him to pass for carlos . the movie has a smartness to it that i don t see much of in american thrillers -- more of a feel for the way spy games really are conducted , complete with double-crosses and screw-ups the way they probably do go down . maybe that has something to do with this being a canadian/french co-production , rather than a wholly american one , and it s reflected in the way the story plays out . we don t get an ending where everything is settled with the right guy getting shot , although we do get an extra , tacked-on epilogue that s a bit more gratuitous than we really needed . what is best here is the acting . here we have three actors doing a great job -- sutherland , quinn , and kingsley , all in a three-way psychic fencing match . one of them is trying to trap a monster ; one is trying to create one . and one is becoming more of one than he ever dreamed . it s neat to watch . -----== posted via deja news , the leader in internet discussion ==----- http : //www . dejanews . com/ now offering spam-free web-based newsreading '

aspect ratio 2 . 35 : 1 directed by martin scorsese ; produced by barbara de fina , scott rudin . written by paul schrader ; based on the novel by joe connelly . photographed by robert richardson ; edited by thelma schoonmaker . go long enough without sleep and you don t just feel tired , you feel like you re in another world . hot and cold take turns to surge through your body as you stagger and yawn . you mumble nonsense , speak with great clarity , then relapse into mumbling again . your eyes open and close like frustrated curtains as you drift between alertness and snoozing . the self-destructive feelings are heightened if you haven t eaten , and are surviving on cigarette smoke , or coffee , or booze . trust me . i have experience in this area . frank pierce , the new york city ambulance driver played by nicolas cage in " bringing out the dead " , lives like this for weeks on end . he sees himself as a " grief mop " , paid to bear witness to hopeless situations , and it s damaging him . he gets through the long days and nights on a diet of whisky , coffee and marlboros , begging his boss to fire him because he hasn t got the energy to quit . the film has been written by paul schrader and directed by martin scorsese , and has been unfairly compared to their 1976 masterpiece " taxi driver " . both pictures feature angst-ridden insomniac protagonists who look out at the urban jungle from uncomfortable driver s seats , and both have dizzying images of garish neon light . but " taxi driver " was about a sensitive vietnam vet whose terrible experiences were turning him into a psychopath ; " bringing out the dead " follows an essentially good man who is aware and afraid of his impending mental collapse . once , of course , frank was good at his job -- acting with skill and speed , relishing the satisfaction of saving peoples  lives . now he wanders around like a zombie , essentially performing a taxi service for corpses and crank callers . he feels tormented by the ghosts of those who he failed to save , and sometimes hears their voices : particularly haunting is an asthmatic 18-year old girl named rose , whose death signalled the beginning of frank s unlucky streak . we follow frank around for three days , and see him work with three other ambulance men : larry ( john goodman ) , a family man who dreams of starting his own private medical service ; marcus ( ving rhames ) , who calls himself a christian but has a mischievous spirit ; and tom ( tom sizemore ) , who can only be described as a nutcase . each of these men is distinctively written and played , and yet , in some odd way , all three shifts seem the same . whoever s in the ambulance with you , it s just another miserable day on the job . most of the characters that are revisited by the screenplay revolve in some way around mary ( patricia arquette ) , a recovering drug addict who frank thinks he could fall in love with . her father is in hospital after a heart attack . a crazy guy from her neighbourhood keeps putting himself in dangerous situations , and winding up in frank s vehicle . and her former drug dealer is given some attention , too . but none of this stuff really signifies much , because " bringing out the dead " is told from frank s point of view , and is about his inability to find meaning in anything . that s not as bleak as it sounds , because the closing shots leave us with the impression that frank will eventually find some peace in his life . but it is exhausting , because to get the point across schrader and scorsese have had to make a two-hour film in which nothing can be seen to develop after the initial set-up . and yet i recommend " bringing out the dead " as a marvellous atmospheric achievement . like frank , from the opening moments we re immersed in neon light and bumpy automobile movements , and in such techniques as jump cuts , dissolves , slow-motion , fast-motion and subjective camera . scorsese s instinct to employ robert richardson was a good one -- the cinematographer s juxtaposition of extreme brightness and darkness create an overpoweringly drowsy mood that brings us into frank s head . not that it s a particularly nice place to be , as cage demonstrates with his amazing performance -- whenever we glimpse him , he s hollow-eyed , desperate , hunched over , hesitant . there is much dark humour in this movie , arising from the absurdity of some of the patients  predicaments , and the twisted games we see medics engage in to pass the time . but it s the harsher images that stick in our minds , because scorsese makes us feel like we re seeing them first-hand . john lennon once sung about " a place where nothing is real . . . where everything flows " . i m sure frank pierce would love to go there . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantganiplease visit , and encourage others to visit , the uk critic s website , located at http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic '
positiveC,' onegin   -a review by bill chambers ( bill@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring ralph fiennes , liv tyler , toby stephens , lena headey screenplay by peter ettedgui and michael ignatieff , based on the poem " yevgeny onegin " by alexander pushkin directed by martha fiennes " when will the devil take me ? " he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over . the spoiled title character of _onegin_ ( pronounced oh-negg-in ) is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour . martha fiennes  debut feature is ( quite literally ) filmed poetry ( it s based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin ) , a profound study of regret , of how we confuse shame with guilt . when we first meet eugene onegin ( ralph , acting for his sister ; another brother , magnus , composed the score ) , a philandering aristocrat from st . petersburg , he has just inherited his uncle s estate . with plans to sell it , onegin pays a summer visit to the manor , which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside , and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods . smitten with olga larina ( headey ) , he befriends olga s fiancé , vladimir lensky ( stephens ) , while olga s sister , tatyana ( tyler ) , romanticizing his flippant attitude ( he s a nineteenth bad boy ) , falls for onegin . in one sweaty , inky torrent of passion , tatyana writes him a love letter . he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections , it is implied , because he can . soon after , tragedy strikes , and onegin makes himself scarce . when we catch up with him , six years later , he has just returned to st . petersburg , where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend ( donovan ) has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana . this time , onegin finds her irresistable . what is most amazing about ralph fiennes  performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch . overwhelmed by a top hat , the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off , an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past . the actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there s room to breathe in a role that s made up of shades of gray like " onegin " . petula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in " parking lot " : " you don t know what you ve got til it s gone . " onegin s about-face on tatyana speaks for those of us ( read : most of us ) who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well . what the character feels is not jealousy but remorse , embarrassment , even , at having let her go . out of identification we feel empathy for onegin , a callous bastard . tatyana s emotions echo a thousand ditties , but that makes them no less vital . she changes , too , from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties . tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co-stars , filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares . they both have faces , mr . fiennes and ms . tyler , capable of conveying archetypal russian misery . _onegin_ could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of " masterpiece theater " , even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact , were martha fiennes not at the helm . an mtv background ( she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others ) has positively influenced her sense of pace ( though , thankfully , not her shot lengths-no spasmodic cutting here ) ; at just over 100 minutes , _onegin_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair . the film has an atypical period look , as well . absent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions . the sets are almost expressionistically bare , echoing the loneliness of the protagonists . ( cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them ; i m reminded the climax , which unfolds in a sea of white . ) martha fiennes has a clear command of cinema , and her spare , often painfully human visual presentation of " yevgeny onegin " is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkin s difficult text yet . ms . fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion .

positiveC,' " it s not good to know too much about someone , charlie , " charles warns his niece , charlie ( margaret welsh ) , with a devilish grin . charlie is infatuated with her namesake uncle , her " soul mate " as she calls him since her mother gave her his name . there s a lot to know about charles , not the least of which is that he strangled 3 widows back east . mark harmon , who looks like anything but a killer but specializes in playing them , plays charles , the merry widow murderer in the 1991 hallmark hall of fame remake of the 1943 hitchcock film , shadow of a doubt . and to avoid any questions about his guilt , we see charles in action in the opening scene with his last victim . the story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of petaluma , california , where charles heads to avoid the police . john gay s script uses most of the original screenplay by sally benson , alma reville , and thornton wilder . karen arthur s direction is certainly no match for the great master , but on an absolute scale , the movie maintains a high level of suspense . when supercilious and deceitful charles comes to pay a visit of indeterminate length with his sister and her family in petaluma , they don t know about his nefarious activities . he showers them with elaborate gifts to buy the love they had already given him anyway . two mysterious and exceedingly clean-cut writers for a magazine show up to take pictures of the family for a spread on the " average american family , " but their interest is focused on uncle charles , especially on taking his picture and learning about his background . charlie , who first welcomed her uncle s visit , begins to feel more and more uncomfortable with him and suspicious of the disingenuous magazine reporters . the picture advances with a delicate power using small details such as the newspaper article that the uncle tries secretly to remove and that charlie discovers . the beauty of the story is the pas de deux between uncle and niece as they try to out psych each other . she wants him to leave , and he doesn t want to go , what with a local , rich widow as a prospective victim . will charles kill charlie first , or will she get him out of town . harmon is wonderfully creepy and smug , and welsh is tough but trapped . with a deft touch the director sets up each scene , several with thunderstorms , and tom neuwirth s sepia-toned cinematography makes the movie feel as if it were filmed in the 50s . my only quibble is the director s awkward staging of the final scene on the train . is hitchcock s version better ? of course . is this one worth watching as well ? actually , yes . shadow of a doubt runs 1 : 40 . it is not rated but would be pg for adult themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up .

james cromwell , george dzundza , mykelti williamson . here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . okay , it isn t quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . but , the thing is , it isn t . it s well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . but the species series isn t about the lack of these elements . it s about how much it can get into one film . and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film s needs . species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . well , it would seem that he has succeeded . landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . of course , he isn t the first ever . about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . now , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . no life lives on it . that is , no visible life . patrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . he takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . unfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . just prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . they pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can t even remember . they blame it on a technical malfunction . back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . as we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . however , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . eve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . however , this time around , most of her " alien " urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . the project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . since she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . and it has . story-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can t tell me it was strong on story ) . what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . the script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . beginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . and it does it quite well . the characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . the only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . there are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . the special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . but for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . also , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone s head being blown off . however , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . however , i tend to disagree . what were the alien films about ? and , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . i didn t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . the acting is quite good for this kind of film . it is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . the acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . okay , so it isn t that good . george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . natasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . however , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . oh yeah , and she s quite fun to just plain watch . marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . michael madsen is so-so , but he isn t annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . james cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . as i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . and , of course , justin lazard . lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . sure , he is wooden , but isn t that what his character is like ? the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple s acting . species ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . more than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . hell , i don t even know if i will . what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . i probably won t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . medak has also mastered the wonderful " jump ! " moments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . strong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining . reviewed by respect ( respect@aros . net ) http : //venus . aros . net/~respect/movies . html '
positiveC,' up until about a year ago , john travolta s career consisted of those " look who s talking " movies ( notice how they never called them look who s talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) . but somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again . weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named " size isn t everything " ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) . but now travolta s back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why . four words : contract with the devil . and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich s " contract with america . " no , satan is much more humane . anyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld . how do i know ? i own the document in question . amazing what you can buy at those collector s shops for a few hundred dollars , isn t it ? get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer . he goes to collect some of the mafia s money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game . sure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that s beside the point . palmer is determined to get hackman s next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito . it doesn t take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from " who s the boss ? " to speechless . it works in this case , unlike " who s the boss ? " although it s interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also . complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman s other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting . get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities . this movie doesn t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i ve seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) . get shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence . i m definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on . are you getting this , shorty ?

( a gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana . ) the underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt , emotive performance as the nice-guy husband , who is as authoritive and likeable as tom . he is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist , lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a short-cut for explaining away the cheating spouse s motivation . unfortunately , one of the horse whisperer s only flaws is the chemistry between would-be lovers scott-thomas and redford . i liked both of them , but i didn t necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish , even if the countryside air thawed her slightly . luckily ( and curiously ) , this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesn t quite matter-their adultery seems like an afterthought , the obligatory sub-plot that ties many of the characters  complex relationships together .

positiveC,' starring don mckellar , callum keith rennie , sandra oh " last night " could have an " aka " tagged on the end of it that says , " it s the end of the world , and we feel fine " . " last night " is about just that . the last night of planet earth s existence . the world is going to end at precisely midnight , january 1st , 2000 . how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained . nor is the event itself . throughout the entire movie , no explanation is given as to why this is happening . in doing this , mckellar ( who also wrote and directed the film ) seems to be trying to transcend the genre . he s attempted to make a film about people , and how each of them deals with their last night of life . the film contains no science fiction elements , which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters . mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material . the film is set in toronto , and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence . there s mckellar , who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs , but keeps getting interrupted by a woman ( sandra oh ) in search of her husband . her husband , played by david cronenberg , is spending the day working at the gas company , informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end . finally , there s mckellar s friend , played by callum keith rennie , a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of . mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i ve seen in a film in months . these people all felt real to me , especially the character played by sandra oh . we can see her desperation , her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours . rennie is good , too , as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies . he exudes such charm and likeablity , it s not surprising that we re rooting for him to get what he wants . but for me , the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar . i knew that he was a talented director , but i had no idea he could act as well . his insistence to be alone , much to the dismay of his parents , is something that most people would find difficult to understand , but as played by mckellar , we can understand his reasons . he doesn t buy into the whole notion that just because everyone s going to die , he should immediately find some companionship . he realizes the relationship would be forced , and they would only be together for the sake of being together . mckellar gives a brilliant performance , and i hope he alternates between directing and acting . my only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending . i really wanted to know , and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times . i appreciate the fact that mckellar didn t want the material to rule the film , and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious . however , in not telling the audience what the cause of earth s destruction is , he s left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film . another problem is we never see anybody panicking . i would imagine if the world was ending , and there was nothing to be done about it , a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds . instead , we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it s new year s eve . i just didn t buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate . no one had the urge to " rage against the dying of the light " . despite these small problems , " last night " is one of the best movies of the year . as opposed to the moronic " armageddon " , " last night " treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty . and bruce willis never shows up to save the day .

positiveC,' it bears repeating : just because you happen to make an amazing , perfectly-crafted , wildly funny movie ( fargo ) , doesn t mean you can do whatever the hell you want in your follow-up and pass it off as art . the big lebowski is the definitive answer to skeptics like me who wondered if fargo was the fluke , and ho-hum flicks like the hudsucker proxy and raising arizona were more the norm for the coen brothers . they undoubtedly are . in the big lebowski , the coens had the world to play with as a palette . what they delivered is a wreck . the story , what little there is of one , follows jeff " the dude " lebowski ( bridges ) , a bum/amateur bowler who gets caught up in a kidnapping-gone-wrong scheme involving a millionaire who happens to have the same name . promising premise ( even if it sounds familiar . . . ) , but the story is totally blown on one-dimensional goofball characters , blind side plots that go nowhere , and a meandering plotline that barely keeps you awake . sure , with characters like goodman s vietnam vet/wacked-out bowling buddy , moore s new age " vaginal " artist , and , most memorably , john turturro s minuscule role as jesus , the most flamboyant bowler alive , there is plenty to be amused by in the film , and sometimes it s absolutely riotous . but the laughs are hollow . . . because the story just sits there like a 7-10 split .

positiveC,' director : nancy meyers writers : nancy meyers and charles shyer ( based on the 1961 script by david swift and the book " das doppelite lottchen " by erich kastner ) starring : lindsay lohan , dennis quaid , natasha richardson , elaine hendrix , lisa ann walter , simon kunz , polly holliday , maggie wheeler , ronnie stevens , joanna barnes i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again . and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you re going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) . this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite . contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they re usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 . this one , however , is shockingly not bad . in fact , it s actually good . not the original good , but what s great about it is that it doesn t necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining . because it s cute and innocent fun . because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with . because the lead star is immensely appealing . because the parents are also immensely appealing . and ( i m repeating myself ) because it s cute and innocent fun . there s nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it s aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid . i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third . i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn t so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren t even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc s " wonderful world of disney , " where they d show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week . i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like " lady and the tramp " and " pinnochio " ) . and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children s animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn t dare missing . i can even remember seeing the made-for-tv " parent trap ii " on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original " parent trap . " it s more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version . it s playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i d probably dismiss it . i d probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn t seen the original at such a perfect age . watching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence . and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better . this new version did that for me , but it s also charming in its own way . it has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn t corny or condescending , but just right . the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way . and for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults . the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa s " the seven samurai " : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents . one , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin  fashion designer . she grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing . the other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming . they both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged . they feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin . there , they become friends , then learn about eachother . once they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they ve only heard of . they learn about eachother s lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in " pulp fiction " ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best . lindsay lohan doesn t necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original . but she comes off just as appealing as she did once . she does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively . she also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones  accents aren t exactly perfect . she s also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films . she makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing . dennis quaid , in fact , hasn t been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he s mr . meg ryan . ditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn t ever been this likable period ) . the two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film . instead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film s more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films . this all brings this new " parent trap " to a level of entertainment that hasn t really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time . this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who s deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore . like the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : " it takes two " starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around . and because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew . however , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better . certain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original . i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear . and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom . the original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences . as such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances . '
positiveC,' what with the special edition out on video ( i snapped up my copy as quickly as anyone ) i thought i d make some comments on these films . why is star wars as charming and graceful as it is ? why has it endured as well as it has ? with the exceptions of james earl jones and alec guiness , the acting is pretty mediocre . let s just call it corny . ( why , oh why , couldn t lucas use computers to substitute better performers in the lead roles ? ) we never really feel close to the characters . why is it my candidate for the finest pure entertainment ever commited to the screen ? ( it s demeaning to raiders of the lost ark , jaws and the empire strikes back to call them pure entertainments . ) it s not a perfect film , but it s a heck of a good one . many of my friends have a respect bordering on a religious obsession with it . ( my friend adam - who thinks that rotj is the best of the trilogy and tesb is the worst - owns paperback continuations of the movies and soundtracks meant to be played along as you read . ) the film certainly has a place in my heart although i m not sure i love it as much as they . watching it today i feel manipulated . it hold up over numerous viewings and yet . . . something is missing . to many remaking star wars is what remaking casablanca ( they re doing it ! ) and the godfather is to me : sad and pointless . it would ruin the legend of the movie . yet . . . i ll say it against my better judgment ( and it will anger many people . ) if it s done do it with a new script . have steven spielberg direct . use new music . set it in the future . get rid of the first line ( along time ago in a galaxy far far away . . . ) . cast jack nicholson as darth vader and get rid of the clunky outfit . wait till i get to hollywood ! bwa , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha ! star wars is still terrific fun and wonderfully entertaining . it s a really good movie with a great one inside , struggling to break free . how good is the second installment , tesb ? in a word : magnificent . it s a glorious film from start to finish . in the first shot it tells you what it s going to do and then it does it . a stirring comic book mix of great acting , wonderful music , mature special effects , and dark thoughts , as directed by irvin kershner - with ravishing gusto - the psychological tension is so clear . and did i mention great fun ? it ll sweep you off your feet . so many moments , so many sights . a betrayal , a friendship , a great movie . . . so good that i think i might call it one of the greatest ever made . the special edition is truly special . i could see it once a week without growing tired of it . sadly this cannot be said of rotj , the mediocre conclusion to the trilogy . it s not bad , but it takes a suprising ( and disarming ) turn towards mediocre filmmaking . i ve always felt that it goes down too easily , when you should hesitate before accepting the conclusion and outcome . not that it s bad ; it s just not very meaningful . fans of the film will argue with me : " it s not even meant to be meaningful , you take yourself way to seriously , blah blah blah , yada yada yada etc . etc . " . hmm . . . i m not entirely sure i agree . the entire star wars trilogy revolves around religion ( the force ) , and what can be seen as serious issues ( the battle between good and evil . ) this is a fun movie but it doesn t quite capture the sense of awe and excitement the first two do . it s meant to be seen on a big screen . ( much like gone with the wind , an entertaining but wildy over-rated and equally mediocre film . ) both films are esentially entertainments that could have been alot better then they are . as seen on a big screen rotj is great fun . ( if i had reviewed it after seeing it on the big screen i would have gave it  and b + . ) but i m talking little screen here - the video experience . and that ain t all that great . i still like the film - but i don t love it . i m starting to worry that mr . lucas will not live up to our expectations when he releases his new films . perhaps there is no way he can .

positiveC,' james l . brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy . nicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen . he s racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone . so , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t . v sitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 ) . naturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end . like good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy . nicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish . only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers . hunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson . there s also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them . kinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he s more of a plot convience than a character . although his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together . in fact , the scene stealer is simon s dog , who is funnier than nicholson . but then again , pets are always cute on screen . providing solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn t as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun . he overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying . smith is also good , although she has a fairly small role . even director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor . but this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he s in , he s steals it . he s character is so hateful , though , it s amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol . and this is the films main problem . it s totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin . she doesn t fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him . also , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly . i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person . it would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out . brooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience . he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he s good . there s also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer . but , generally , as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do , which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie . the movie is a bit overlong , but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly . overall , as good as it gets is a fun movie , even though it may be unbelivable , and certainly worth seeing ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . ) not quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke ) , but still good fun .

positiveC,' set in the wild west , this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid ( sidney james ) and his cronies in stodge city . his dodgy dealings and summary shootings aggravate judge burke ( kenneth williams ) so much that he asks sheriff albert earp ( jon pertwee ) to drive rumpo out of town . instead , the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead . therefore , judge burke sends for a law marshall to come in and clean up the city . due to a misunderstanding , an english sanitary engineer called marshall p . knutt ( jim dale ) is assigned , without knowing it , as the law marshall for stodge city . he arrives at the same time as annie oakley ( angela douglas ) who is seeking revenge for her father , the sheriff s murder . when marshall arrives at stodge city , he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding and due to his rather limited intellect , he is manipulated by the rumpo kid and always ends up getting things wrong . in the end , there is a head-to-head between rumpo and marshall . with the rumpo s past experience , it would seem that marshall is out of his depth , but using his sanitary skills and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley , he at least stands some chance ! sid james , with an american accent , is perfect as the rumpo kid , a part which suits him down to the ground . jim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer , and angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter . other regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey and bernard bresslaw ( in his debut ) as big heap and little heap respectively . big heap is the local indian leader and the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing , as is his performance : - he steals every scene he is in even though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past . joan sims provides useful and amusing support as belle , the local bar owner who takes a fancy to the rumpo kid . however , the part of doc played by peter butterworth and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary , and pertwee s performance is rather poor . kenneth williams uses a new voice but struggles with the weak part of the  judge  . even so , this carry on was sid james and kenneth williams  favourite . a very different carry on film , in that it is played more seriously by the actors and possesses more realism than any other carry on . the death count is the highest of any carry on film . sets , costumes and action sequences are all very commendable . the songs that are included in the movie ( the title song and annie s song ) are very impressive . a strange but therefore very interesting carry on film . not the best of its kind but it is certainly the most distinctive film of the series .

positiveC,' directed by peter berg . cast : jon favreau , cameron diaz , christian slater , jeremy piven , leland orser , daniel stern , jeanne tripplehorn , joey zimmerman , tyler malinger , carla scott , russell b . mckenzie . 1998 - 101 minutes . rated r ( for extreme violence , gore , profanity , sex , and nudity ) . reviewed november 27 , 1998 . by dustin putman  dustin putman s film reviews  " very bad things , " is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn t help but be won over by the material . the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas . the groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) . the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern ) . after a wild night of gambling , boozing , and drugs , a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room , but after a freak accident , to everyone s terror , she is killed . as robert puts it : " there are two options : go to the police and go to prison , or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her . " after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body , robert is forced to kill him as well . " okay , there is only one option now . you can forget about calling the police , " he says . by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer , most of them are overcome with guilt , which sets off an even more elaborate series of event , that includes much , much more murder , double-crosses , and the inevitable wedding from hell . " very bad things , " which is actor peter berg s feature film directing debut , is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that , " there s something about mary , " wanted to be . it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh , original , and hilarious , even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence , gore , and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end . the screenplay , also written by berg , is , to put it mildly , very funny and courageous . during the second act of the film , some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death , which was beginning to undermine the humor , but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed . the dialogue is edgy and inventive , and this film proves that a movie doesn t necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable . there s more fun , i think , in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts . cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here , and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura , who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends . diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january . by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger , and reciting lines like , " stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs , " i couldn t help but crack up at how " balls-to-the-wall " this film had become . jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original , as daniel stern s wife , who late in the picture , we discover , is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with . it is at this level that , " very bad things , " was so entertaining and surprising . just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen , there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky . the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top . although i enjoyed the film immensely , let me make this clear : " very bad things , " is not a movie for everyone . it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen , it is more violent and bloody than a r-rated film usually is , and it is offensive . luckily , these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy , since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred , politically incorrect comedy . the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and " safe " wide-releases coming out lately , still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry .

positiveC,' ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead . bruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) . the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film s tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years . followed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) . the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it s original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 . the disc contains two versions of the film s audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 . included are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film s star , bruce campbell . campbell s commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film . such informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it s title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard . also , there s a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they ve found that s explaining about the demonic forces in the woods . for that scene , it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana , so being the wacky kids that they were at the time , they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene . almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor s had never smoked before , and as a result they became " confused " and were unable to perform the scene . i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track . the two people you d think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all . don t get me wrong here , when they do speak it s entertaining to hear , but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time . sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask " have anything to say sam ? " to me , that s not a good sign . also , it seems like sam raimi doesn t remember much about the film and it s production . . . well , compared to rob and bruce anyway . also included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film s " gala " premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film . this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques . overall , the evil dead is a good low budget horror film , superior to many films in it s genre . and the collector s edition dvd release is well worth your time if you re either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process . all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining . the jacksonville film journal -- film reviews by chuck dowling url : http : //users . southeast . net/~chuckd21/ email : chuckd21@leading . net © 1999 of the jacksonville film journal . no reviews may be reprinted without permission .

positiveC,' you know , i ve seen network before , and it s a much better film . bulworth is , in the kindest of words , an " homage " to that picture , and at least it has an excellent role model . simply take the story about a tv newsman who goes nuts , stirs up controversy , and fatally angers the establishment and change it to a us senator who does the same thing , and you ve got bulworth . warren beatty s title role performance is the only reason bulworth has anything going for it at all . much like tom cruise in jerry maguire , beatty takes a difficult character and makes it his own , and while beatty as a foul-mouthed politician is not exactly playing against type , it s still his very aggressive performance that carries the picture . everything else , from the dismal supporting cast ( halle berry has never looked so lost ) to the throw-away one-liners ( you ve seen all the best over and over again on the trailers ) is cut-and-pasted from network or clearly dredged from some late night rewrite session . still , beatty s in fine form , and his outrageous wackiness takes the film halfway to where it could have been . ( and geez , he directed , produced , wrote , and starred in the film . . . maybe someone was a little too busy ? ) but overall , the missed opportunities , the overtly silly anti-pc message backed up by nothing , and the all-too-forseeable ending make bulworth little more than a fable that we already knew : that anyone involved with politics is totally insane .

positiveC,' mulan ( walt disney pictures - 1998 ) voices by ming-na wen , eddie murphy , b . d . wong , harvey fierstein screenplay by rita hsiao , christopher sanders , philip lazebnik , raymond singer , eugenia bostwick-singer produced by pam coats directed by barry cook & tony bancroft running time : 88 minutes note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . ------------------------------------------------------------- east meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney s parade of annual animated feature films . an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential . though not for lack of trying . in many respects , mulan is among disney s most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat . the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child s discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan s later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? in an instant , idealistic mulan s innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending . the film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family s obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) . dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney s new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film s vocal work , there s liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can t imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it s rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it s startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan s land . at its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage . as such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity . scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan s venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation . mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine s character-defining opening half-hour . it s when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . off to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little " lucky " cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief . they re affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity . at training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang . everybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film . the romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story s neo-feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation . another staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness . composed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- " i ll make a man out of you " ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . only " reflections " , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre s most wondrously pure voices . nonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer-generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive . while the blatantly child-friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they re not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable . briskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter .

positiveC,' luckily , some people got starship troopers . some people knew it was supposed to be silly . for those of you who didn t , how could you miss it ? from the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly . i guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick , some people just don t recognize such goofy humor . such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned . first thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up . meet the equivalent of " beverly hills 90210 " meets " mighty morphin power rangers " . four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces , which , in the future , means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country . johnny rico ( casper van dien ) is ready to join the infantry , mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) has enlisted to be a pilot . dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) has enlisted as a trooper , and it s possible she s joining merely to follow rico , whom she s always had eyes for . if you saw these three on the street , you d automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie s cast looked so much like the cut-out cover of " seventeen " magazine . the lone non-supermodel , carl jenkins ( played by doogie howser himself , neil patrick harris ) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division , the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie - er , carl out of the picture . ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters ) . right off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time . but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits . with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home . well sorry , rico suave , but there s no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it . that s right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid-like alien beings that a can of raid just isn t going to destroy . with a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs . what starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci-fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc . nothing is taken seriously . it s almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless , but with its sly and futuristic approach , it s not as recognizably so . it s a spoof so subtle that many won t recognize the spoofery . if you deem this as sci-fi/action , you re wrong . it s sci-fi/action/comedy , with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2 . starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well . gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film , but the gore , too , is meant to be cheesy . yes , it s graphic , but it s also brutally phony , and that s what makes it such great fun to watch . not since the old " mr . bill " skits on " saturday night live " has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch . people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated . perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters  barbie dolls as young children . with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely , it s a good chance this is the case , whether we re fully aware of it or not . starship troopers has it s slow parts , but it s truly an alternative to your typical sci-fi/action flick or lame juvenile comedy . aside from the intentionally cheesy gore , the special effects are quite astounding . when the spaceship passes a meteor , it s quite an awesome spectacle , visually crisp and captivating . if you re looking for brainless fun , this is the epitome of your search . a beautiful cast , awesome special effects , fast-paced action , campy acting , and a whole lot of gore . this is brainless heaven . just remember not to think .

positiveC,' directed by : mike nichols written by : garry shandling ( story ) , michael leeson how do you think an alien would react if forced to experience the trials of human dating rituals ? this is the main idea behind " what planet are you from ? " , the new comedy from director mike nichols ( " primary colors " , " the birdcage " ) . garry shandling ( " the larry sanders show " ) , who also developed the film s story , plays the lead role . the truth is , i went into this movie not expecting a whole lot out of shandling . i ve never cared for his previous roles , and the previews looked somewhat bland . much to my surprise , " what planet are you from ? " turned out to be quite an enjoyable movie with fairly consistent laughs throughout . this is mainly because not only does shandling do an admirable job , but he is surrounded by a great supporting cast . on a planet way the hell out there , a race of men is preparing to take over the universe by sending minions to have sex with women from every other race in the galaxy . harold anderson ( garry shandling ) has been chosen to procreate with a female from earth . his planet s leader ( ben kingsley ) prepares him with the necessary training ( in a very amusing opening scene ) and gives him two days to conceive a child . however , upon his arrival , anderson finds that his training has not prepared him for the illogical behavior of humans . he immediately seeks help from a co-worker ( greg kinnear ) and is soon introduced to a suitable mate named susan ( annette bening ) . anderson is faced with two problems now : first , susan will only mate with him after they are married , and second , his arrival on the planet has aroused the suspicions of an airport employee ( john goodman ) who soon discovers who anderson really is . i think the funniest thing about shandling s performance throughout " what planet are you from ? " is that he reacts to everything thrown at him in such a logical manner . for example , in one scene susan is upset with harold for watching television rather than paying attention to her . she hurls the remote against the wall , smashing it . harold immediately decides to purchase a new remote , which further infuriates susan . she then shouts " fine , just go ! " harold promptly nods his head and leaves . annette bening is perfectly cast as susan , managing somehow to look hassled , angry , and deeply confused all at once . she also manages to save shandling at times when his lack of experience in a leading role begins to show . the supporting cast is , in fact , one of the best things about this film . greg kinnear ( " mystery men " , " as good as it gets " ) is perfect as the king of sleaze balls everywhere . ben kingsley ( " species " , " schindler s list " ) is a great choice as the straight as an arrow ruler of anderson s planet , though he is a bit underused . john goodman ( " the big lebowski " ) , who i believe is one of the best comic actors in hollywood , is hilarious in his role as the one man who thinks he knows the truth . one of the biggest problems i had with the film was that goodman was so underused that his character seemed rather pointless . linda fiorentino ( " dogma " ) makes a brief appearance as kinnear s wife , and janeane garofolo shows up in a cameo as an airline passenger . the film may not make a whole lot of sense , since we are never told just how anderson s impregnating a woman will bring about the downfall of the species , but plot isn t exactly the point here . while " what planet are you from ? " manages to keep the humor going through the majority of its length , things do get a bit too sappy and sentimental towards the end . if it had been trimmend down some from its 112 minute running time i probably would have given it four stars . one last thing i must note is that annette bening plays a real-estate agent in the film ( " american beauty " , anyone ? ) . for a very funny script , a surprisingly good turn by garry shandling , and a great supporting cast , i give " what planet are you from ?

" - type of thing ) . the guy in this film barely seems to be " put off " by the fact that he s surrounded by apes who can speak english ! ! where s joblo coming from ? the arrival ( 8/10 ) - battlefield earth ( 7/10 ) - godzilla ( 4/10 ) - instinct ( 6/10 ) - mission to mars ( 3/10 ) - pitch black ( 7/10 ) - ( 1968 ) planet of the apes ( 9/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 ) '
positiveC,' in roger michell s romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it s name to the film s title . one day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey . quickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat . the film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress s appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . without words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . following , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . i don t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie s beginning , but there it is . if there were ever a clear case for " less is more , " this would be it . the film is told nearly first person from william s point of view , as he is in every scene . by nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . in fact , much of notting hill s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator . or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . william assures her he wouldn t say a word , then adds , " well , i ll probably tell myself now and then , but i d never believe it . " great stuff . the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . we re constantly exposed to william s thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we re not sure what she s been thinking all the times in between . this , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant s film hands down . he gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character s unpredictable behavior . anna doesn t get a lot of our compassion . this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . most notable is rhys ifans as spike , william s eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . hugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william s friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister s birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . it s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . roger michell s use of visuals doesn t sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . for example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying " eight months later , " michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . we re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird s eye view of the ground below . music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film s scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . it s kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . notting hill s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . for a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that s not so bad , now is it ?

positiveC,' set in spain , vengo is a standard mob story with a highly artistic twist . there isn t much of a plot , and what there is isn t that important . it is simply a frame within which to explore the culture of some vibrant spanish gypsies . in fact , the actual " talkie " scenes almost become too much of a distraction from the rich portrayal of the community . in vengo , there are two warring families whom you can t tell apart until they are yelling at each other . you connect with cacao ( antonio canales ) because he is followed throughout the film . he is charismatic , even in arrogance . everyone loves and obeys him , somewhat at a distance , as his daughter recently died . he is the guardian of his nephew because his brother shot a member of the caravacas family , which wants blood for blood , like any godfather movie , while cacao tries his best to make peace . cacao spends time with his family , throwing parties with hired bands , making sure his retarded nephew has a good time . in between are moments with those in charge of the caravacas family , building a slow , poignant path to revenge . every once in a while a few comedic notes are thrown in as the older women of the village clean up after the youngsters . luckily the plot development is repetitively simple so that all of the characters have room to be sympathetic . there isn t an annoying " good and evil " perspective placed on the viewer . this film is not about picking sides in an argument or making morality calls . it s simply an age-old dilemma of how one family deals with loss and another family who must grudgingly accept responsibility for it . but the music and dancing are the key roles in vengo . between the variety shown and the pride taken in skill and passing down of tradition , it s easy to become mesmerized with the culture . a nice added touch is that men take as much pride as women in being able to evoke physical grace . and though the dancing does have a sexually alluring quality , it is not the reason for participation . it can be difficult to grasp the lyrics because they are only partially subtitled . this is unfortunate for outsiders who know little about gypsy life because it s impossible to guess at the inspiration for such emoting performances . at least the emotional expression of the singers provides an easily sympathetic intensity that evokes an understanding about how attached the music is to tradition . you can assume that for every major change in their culture , there is a song to go with it that is passed down from one generation to the next . gatlif has managed to utilize an old , almost boring , plot structure to respectfully portray a culture much overlooked . he obviously loved his subject and the way in which it was filmed provides a contagious appreciation for a people often misunderstood .

" the deep end " uses a color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by a vast array of blues . alluring , attractive blues , but also icy and foreboding . after taking in their beauty , the eye seeks out the reassuring browns and greens , like a tired swimmer searching for the safety of land . the production works that way as well  it pulls you in initially as a crisp , thoroughly-modern thriller , with clipped exchanges between defiantly non-communicative characters . but the real draw of the film is the submerged humanity of two key players as " the deep end " gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy coating . spoiler alert : the following reveals the basic storyline . i believe the plot points are incidental , because the real rewards come in exploring the mindset of the main characters , but still , you should proceed at your own risk . with her husband tom , a naval officer , often away at sea , margaret hall ( tilda swinton ) holds down the fort , taking care of the children , beau ( jonathan tucker ) , paige ( tamara hope ) , and dylan ( jordon dorrance ) , while her father-in-law jack ( peter donat ) hovers in the background , always watching . the story opens with margaret leaving the family home in lake tahoe to storm a male strip club in reno . it seems that beau , her eldest , is having an affair with darby reese ( josh lucas ) , a disreputable sort 12 years his senior . margaret demands that darby leave her son alone , only to have the man smirk at her and announce he ll be glad to steer clear of beau  for $5000 . back at home , she tries to talk about it all with her son , but the kid won t even confirm that he s gay , let alone discuss the issues she has with his boyfriend . he does , however , get attentive when she reveals darby s $5 , 000 offer , even as he maintains his sullen demeanor . late in the evening , darby shows up outside , tossing pebbles at beau s window like a schoolchild . the two meet by the water at the boathouse , where something important happens . i won t reveal what ; suffice to say we become aware of a significant fact that margaret does not . all of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie , by the way . within a day or so , margaret s life becomes even more complicated when a suave man named alec goran visnjic ) turns up with an explicit videotape documenting the sex life of beau and darby . he and his associate are willing to destroy the tape , once margaret coughs up $50 , 000 .

positiveC,' first films are usually clumsy , experimental , and uneven . but 43-year-old erick zonca has turned the tables with his first film , the dreamlife of angels . like many french films , the dreamlife of angels is slow-paced , but the surplus of emotion makes up for the lack of plot . the film features two outstanding performances from elodie bouchez and natacha regnier , who shared the best actress award at last year s cannes film festival , while peter mullan took home best actor for my name is joe , a similar emotional experience . the first character we meet in the dreamlife of angels is isa ( elodie bouchez ) , an impoverished drifter with a past we never learn much about . she wanders into a french city , selling homemade postcards which she says are for the poor . a man whom she meets in a cafe lets her have a sewing job in his factory . in the factory , she meets marie ( natacha regnier ) , a shy woman given to fits of rage . marie agrees to let isa stay at her flat , which she is taking care of for a woman who was in a car crash with her young daughter . isa and marie become friends , and during a night on the town , they meet charly ( patrick mercado ) and fredo ( jo prestia ) , a couple of bouncers from a nearby nightclub . charly and marie are involved until she meets chris ( gregoire colin ) , a rich playboy who owns the club . it is obvious that marie is with the wrong man , and it seems to be tearing her apart , and slowly she is suffering a nervous breakdown . meanwhile , isa has begun to read the personal diary of the girl who was in the car crash , and she begins to visit the child in the hospital , day after day . the dreamlife of angels doesn t offer much in the way of a plot , and it takes quite a while to get going , but soon it s not hard to see that the film is a study of two characters , and since they are portrayed so realistically , it s hard not to feel emotionally drained after watching the film . the filmmaking is sometimes raw , and sometimes graceful , depending on the mood of the scene . erick zonca is amazingly gifted , because it takes many filmmakers a few films to create such a sense of powerful immediacy . the dreamlife of angels is a superb , riveting film , and is sure to be among the best first films of the year . a review by akiva gottlieb , the teenage movie critic akiva@excite . com http : //www . angelfire . com/mo/film watch me on tbs  " dinner and a movie " may 21 , 8 : 05pm est get your free , private email at http : //mail . excite . com/ '
positiveC,' if spike lee weren t so self-absorbed , he would probably be one of the best filmmakers around today . instead , he gets caught up in camera tricks , mood lighting , and abrupt editing in an apparent attempt to keep any audience so confused trying to figure out what he is doing that they cannot become emotionally involved in his films . he got game , the latest spike lee joint features nbaer ray allen as jesus shuttlesworth , the top high school basketball player in the country . as he is pondering his future after graduation , he is surrounded by friends and family trying to help him with his decision without really looking out for his own best interest . among those trying to help is his father , jake , played by denzel washington , who has been temporarily released from the state penitentiary under orders to get jesus to sign with the governor s alma mater . unlike most movies that star pro athletes , he got game does not fail because of allen s acting shortcomings . he , and the other pro basketball players featured in the film , are surprisingly solid . instead , the film comes up short primarily because lee does not allow the audience to get involved with the characters until the last half-hour of the film . lee s obsession with technical gadgetry in this film represents a disturbing trend in his work . where in earlier films like do the right thing and malcolm x , his unconventional camera moves and effects only seemed to come in when we least expected them to heighten the emotion , in more recent films like clockers and he got game , lee s effects serve to keep us at arms length . despite this apparent formalism through the majority of the film , he got game still contains a strong emotional power near the climax , when lee finally lets up on the effects . spike lee is definitely a talented filmmaker , but if his next project is going to continue this trend toward formalism , i hope it s a music video .

positiveC,' the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang s film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman . you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips . as it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren t any superheroes . instead , wang s film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city . the laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity . the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment . he loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds . arthur s professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas . his personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives . in fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) . it s the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark . arthur s not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body . she has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine . veteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process . she plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture . arthur s girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation . arthur s best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns . joey is married to arthur s jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house . arthur s 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! he finds it impossible to meet his father s lofty expectations . the various people in arthur s life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity . like wang s earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences . every character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way . the movie also offers a provocative look at technology . wang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job . the film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers . wang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions . was einstein responsible for the a-bomb ? is arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? the movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw . according to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . ironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking . wang s direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w . griffith . cinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee s films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look . mason daring s score , which includes a send-up of bach , is right on target . the laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it s sometimes ambitious to a fault . wang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it s hard to digest them all . for instance , one character ( arthur s sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don t care about her marital problems . in weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands . overall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction . on the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style . the heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film . you can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town .

positiveC,'  deuce bigalow male gigolo is a very pointed film that doesn t waste any time screwing around from the beginning by continuously firing shots at the handicapped , blind , tall , obese and tourette s syndrome inflicted , all to give the audience the pleasure they seek : morally reprehensible yet hilarious sexual humor . the production is also big where it counts : in the heart . this gigolo is well worth the $8 price of entry . deuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) has mastered his trait to a point where he swims with the fishes- literally . a knowledgeable yet sexually deprived fish tank cleaner , the highlight of deuce s day is getting a sales girl to bend far enough over a water-filled tank that her white shirt becomes transparent . but he soon learns that antoine laconte s fish has developed a rare gill disorder . aside from being one of deuce s clients , antoine is a male whore preparing to leave the country on business . soon the title character is fish-sitting in a mansion and , predictably enough , finds himself having destroyed the $6000 mini-aquarium that he is supposed to be looking after . the race is on for him to buy a new one before antoine returns home , and there is only one way he is going to come up with that much money that quickly : the same way antoine does . rob schneider is a member of the saturday night live ( snl ) class that produced stars like adam sandler ( who produced this movie ) , chris farley , david spade , norm macdonald ( who has a cameo ) and mike myers . of the group , schneider is most similar to sandler with his ability to play an average ( or below average for that matter ) joe who happens to be in the right ( or wrong ) place at the right ( or wrong ) time . schneider also exhibits a sandler-sized heart here when he falls in love with a " client " named kate ( arija bareikis ) . but schneider is yet to peak , and if this movie isn t a hit you may never hear his name again , let alone with such prestigious company as the above . so , just how far does this movie push the envelope sexually ? well , it makes the old snl skit " fred gervan : male prostitute " seem tame and this summer s hit film american pie seem like deep throat ( not the nixon informer ) . a police officer pulls down his pants numerous times and complains about his skinny member but no genitalia is ever shown and a pornographic film appears on television but only the sound is indicting . deuce s adventures are relatively innocuous beyond some spanking and condom use , but you shouldn t forget that this is a movie about a gigolo . deuce bigalow male gigolo will likely make a tidy profit from teens seeking its services on weekend nights . the movie needn t worry about getting rushed out of theatres as it will quickly go in video stores where a significant number of people will probably jerk it off the shelf and take it home for hours of private entertainment . running at close to two hours , the film isn t too long to cause pain nor too short to not get the job done .

positiveC,' if you¹ve been paying attention to the media frenzy that is the blair witch project , and who hasn¹t , you know the story and you know it¹s pure dramatization . needless to say , though , watching what has been committed to tape , one gets the undeniable impression the events are veritable : three students take hand- helds into the woods , filming a school project about the myth of a local witch , and get lost . no biggie , as the put-upon leader of their crew , heather , states rationally , " it¹s hard to get lost in america , and it¹s harder to stay lost . " what starts out fun and games , so to speak , amongst friends ( correct " gilligan¹s island " vernacular ; heather¹s mishap with a pair of wet shoes ) quickly becomes something more serious . rations dwindle , their only map disappears , and camaraderie gradually disintegrates into bickering , nicotine jonesing and total disorientation . they set up camp , several times too often , and wake up to vague but ominous noises just in the distance . and , that¹s the ingenious thing of the film : the heard , yet unseen , proves to be a lot more terrifying . because , try as you may to put what¹s going on into perspective ( twigs snap . . probably a small animal ) , you still don¹t know for certain . and , because there is little light for assistance , you can either stay in one place very quietly and pray , or make a run for it in the pitch black and take your chances . during heather¹s emotionally-draining private confessional for the camera , she sums this experience up quite nicely : " i¹m afraid to close my eyes , and i¹m afraid to open them . " what¹s also great about the film is its budget . the point of view footage is antsy , because the actors get antsy and don¹t know exactly where to look or where they¹re going in the heat of apparent pursuit . i think blair witch will play even better on the small screen , because of its aspect ratio and the likelihood of a more quiet environment ; occasionally , i was unable to hear what the actors were hearing due to an audience loud with throat- clearing and squeaky seats , and it bugged me immensely . there is no special effects work , no computer-generated anything , and mostly no gory close-ups ( save for a set of teeth ) , which gives the film a great deal of authenticity . and , what i like most is the eerie conclusion ; that last scene , in an abandoned , dilapidated house , is nerve-wracking and more than a little disturbing . the collective opinion circulating the net at present is that this scene is too quick , and the film ends rather abruptly . which is true , but that¹s the point . it is heather¹s fear and despondence , come to the breaking point . after being in the woods for so long , and not knowing what would ultimately happen to them at any given moment ­ whether she , or her friends , would make it ­ she and mike arrive at one last spot , maze-like and frustrating , and in an instant it¹s all over . you leave with questions , and want to talk about what you¹ve just witnessed with as many people as you can get it in a room . movies that can put you there have done their job ; real , or fake ( forget the whole is-it-a-sham-or-not business , already ) . that final image ­ you know the one ­ is cryptic and haunting . i wanted more scenes at night , with ­ not _clearer_ sounds , but i don¹t know , more of them . even greater a building of exhaustion and fear . the film does not quite go the psychological distance , but it¹s close . also , the arguing goes on a little much for my taste ( one fight , over the whereabouts of the map , turns especially shrill ) , though such carrying-on is understand- able , circumstances considered . " scary as hell "  no . creepy , yes . effective , brilliantly- conceived and executed , and performed with all the conviction in the world so that even if we doubt what we¹re seeing is real , suspension of disbelief is never an issue : _oh yeah_ . best line : 90% improv equals no cleverly constructed dialogue ; i like the reaction heather has to a shot of scotch ( i hate it , too ) .

positiveC,' eight years after its release , disney has decided to re-release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only . coincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox s animated film anastasia was released . you know disney , they can t deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old " masterpiece " from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox . let no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market . they still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place . believe it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p . m . , i saw the little mermaid for the first time . it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom s friends for a couple weeks . they had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times . by the time i got back home , i promised myself i d never see the movie . but promises are made to be broken , especially when you re looking at a 17-day , limited engagement . damn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games . the little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it s disney-ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song . it also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times . i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells . . . the heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year-old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase . she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans . she s also dealing with feelings she hasn t had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you didn t use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) . her father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the " savage " humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not-so-subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating . what s a king to do , though ? the girl s in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn t deter her . ariel saves the prince s life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him . she makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll ) . you know she s evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history . she also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr . scholl s corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out . she ll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever . and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she ll fall asleep forever . it s a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company . it ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the  50s . all the elements are there -- memorable songs like " under the sea " and " kiss the girl , " cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children . the little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 , so hurry up , you only have five days left .

positiveC,' notting hill  -a review by bill chambers ( nottinghill@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring julia roberts , hugh grant , rhys ifans , gina mckee screenplay by richard curtis directed by roger michell notting hill s trailer is awful : a laughless , schmaltzy montage . the movie was desperately marketed to the anti-phantom menace crowd , the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter . and it apparently worked . perhaps the presence of julia roberts-whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me-had a lot to do with notting hill s opening weekend success , but the film s staying power is based on word of mouth . allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill . grant stars as william thacker , a travel-bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill . into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott ( roberts ) . a common thief , some spilled orange juice , and some stilted conversation leads to their first , highly impetuous ( or is that improbable ? ) , kiss . days later , william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist , and so begins a passionate , albeit surreptitious , affair . ( aside : notting hill s portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate . ) only anna s celebrity-or william s lack thereof-threatens to drive a wedge between them . richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered , and for at least its first half-hour the picture s " beauty and the beast " -like scenario is ( romantic ) escapism of the highest order . as with groundhog day or pleasantville , while watching the high-concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead ; it s william s ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna . curtis ( who previously penned four weddings and a funeral ) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple s situation is not enough to fuel two hours  worth of entertainment , so some of notting hill s finest moments revolve around william s eccentric friends and family . by now , dear reader , you ve probably heard a lot about rhys ifans  performance as william s imbecilic welsh flatmate . yes , he s a crowd pleaser , a walking sight gag , but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair-bound ( and appropriately named ) bella ( mckee , the anguished waitress of naked ) or max ( tom mcinnerny ) , her lousy chef of a husband . in the movie s best sequence , william , anna , and company sit around bloated from max s latest concoction and hold a contest : the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life . the scene ends only as a british writer would end it . if anything , fantastic bits like these dull the main plot s dramatic impact . roberts and grant , especially , are appealing , but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times ( four weddings  suffered similar flaws ) , and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common : they re lonely . ( worth noting in roberts  and grant s favour : the ubiquitous " i m just a girl , standing across from a boy , asking him to love her " episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips , and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done . ) notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable ; on the visual side of things , i especially appreciated michell s playful changing-of-the-seasons number . if only ( and this is a surprisinly minor gripe ) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue ; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it , the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up , leaving our imaginations in the lurch .

positiveC,' starring nigel hawthorne , jeremy northam , rebecca pidgeon , gemma jones . rated g . david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director . with his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible . some of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline . and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right . oh , and it s rated g . incidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else s work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century . he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note . " did you do it ? " he asks his boy . " no father , i didn t , " ronnie answers . that s enough for arthur , who , with his oldest daughter ( rebecca pidgeon ) , immediately starts a crusade to bring his son s case to court . they enlist the help of sir robert morton , a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task . it all seems fairly frivolous , and no matter how you look at it , the winslow case is not the trial of the century . but arthur is determined to keep his family s word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that . soon enough , sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings . so do we . all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue , but his style is still fairly apparent . the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense . but this is not mamet s norm , and it s refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks , gangsters as con men , wonderful as those films were . nigel hawthorne s performance is nearly flawless . his delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game . we pity the man , but we also like him . rebecca pidgeon , david mamet s wife , who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur s oldest daughter , a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women s suffrage movement . the winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher -- it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one . be honest : did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill ? if you wanted to but didn t , this is a movie for you . it is the epitome of subtlety : it s powerful without being too emotional , sad without even trying to be depressing . david mamet can churn out some great scripts , but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too . he is almost a national treasure . his films deserve their own genre . ©1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; sent via deja . com http : //www . deja . com/ share what you know . learn what you don t .

positiveC,' the creepy byron de la beckwith ( played extremely well by james woods who got an oscar nomination ) kills civil rights leader medger evers in his own driveway , that was in 1963 . when he is put on trial he faces an all white , all male jury , of course he doesn t get convicted ( he was put on trial twice ) because the judge is the toughest and most racist judge in all of mississippi . then , for some reason , his widow myrlie evers ( goldberg ) decides that she wants to re-open the case after all this time , it s 1989 now , and most people could care less . but she soon forms a bond with bobby delaughter ( baldwin ) a lawyer who pursues the case for over five years . his job is to track down witnesses ( most of them dead ) and keep the case going even if no real evidence is found . when he first views the case as , " the case we ll work on in his spare time " is soon grows to become his obsession because " is it ever too late to do the right thing ? " he eventually gathers up enough evidence ( with the help of william h . macy , god , is he like in every movie ever made or what ? ) and conjures up a new trial . the movie stretches on for too long , do you really need to see him find the kkk members from long ago sitting in denim on a huge bale of hay ? what about the uneeded romance between him and a hospital worker ? i suppose that this is essential to painting a picture for what it was like long ago , but after a while it gets boring . it could have easily been cute to about 95 or 105 minutes , which would have made it much more of a pleasureable experience . this isn t to say the movie isn t great . i was chilled and disgusted every time woods appeared on the screen . i would have loved to see more of his performance . goldberg is also good , it s amazing that she can still act after appearing in so many stupid , screwball comedies . plus the film is rated pg-13 so younger teens can see it , yes they will be bored out of their minds , but i hope some parents force it upon their children to see this movie . it s a great movie ( and like the back of the video says ) " that every american should see . " overall , the movie is a long ( but moving ) experience , and i give it * * * stars . '

( if you don t know much about football , you can identify these scenes by the fact that they usually follow an impassioned speech by one or another player or coach , and are always backed by an emotional rock or r&b hit of the 60 s or 70 s . ) ironically , the occasions when the filmmakers aren t following genre conventions ( in the film s rare opportunities for originality ) are the times when the film tends to flounder the worst . most notably , the subplot about a sexually ambiguous surfer-boy from california is simply awkward and dilutes from tension at the heart of the story . also , the decision to bookend the film with a funeral sequence from ten years later is stupid and pointless . it was unnecessary and overbearing in films like titanic and saving private ryan , but here it is simply a waste of the audience s time and attention . you actually find yourself wondering who is going to die and how that will tie in to the plot , only to find out in the end that it doesn t tie in at all . all in all , the movie is very consistent if not overpowering . you ve seen it all before , but the competent repackaging will manage to tug at your heart strings anyway . we re all suckers like that , i guess . and jerry bruckheimer knows it better than anyone .

positiveC,' directed by : david koepp written by : david koepp ( novel by richard matheson ) starring : kevin bacon , kathryn erbe , illeana douglas , kevin dunn , zachary david cope produced by : judy hofflund , gavin polone after being hypnotized , a man believes there is a ghost in his house . two low-key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year : the blair witch project and the sixth sense . each has made well over $100 million in north america , based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising . if a film s box office take were based primarily on its quality , stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected , for it is as scary , if not scarier than the other two . writer/director david koepp has given artisan entertainment , the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit . the story gets going after tom witzky ( bacon ) , an average blue-collar dad , gets hypnotized by his wife maggie s ( erbe ) sister lisa ( douglas ) at a party . while the hypnosis goes as expected to the party-goers , it triggers something in tom s head . things begin to change around him ( blinking red lights let off a strange hum , for example ) , and he fights to stay in control of his own senses . where these experiences take tom , maggie and their son jake ( cope ) , who tom thinks might have some answers , is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you . david koepp keeps the action localized ; the majority of the action takes place at tom s house or just down the street . by keeping things at home , koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues ( montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc . ) . unfortunately , the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity . humour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting . several tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes . also , there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved , though to mention them would be to give too much away . kevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man losing his sanity admirably . his total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable , as are the reactions from his wife maggie . kathryn erbe is given a role meatier and better written than that of most " wife who can no longer handle her husband " parts . while it is still a supporting role , her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls " a private club that i m not invited to " , where they whisper about things all day long . as jake , zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense , but gets less screen time . both children manage the same trick , making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are . fans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes . it combines the dread of blair , a creepy closed-in feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy and great performances by the whole cast , specifically bacon , to give the fall its first genuine scary film . if only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a bit more , this could have been one of the year s best . email tim chandler at timbit@canada . com check out the bottom line at http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/heights/8000/index . html for more reviews !

positiveC,' probably the most popular and praised film of all time , turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism . everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time . and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron , combining visual -and sound effects , he re-creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere . i liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes . while their cabin is slowly filling up with water , a mother is telling her children a fairytail -- " . . and they lived happily ever after . . " . and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air . however , the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie , while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues . in the present day , the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett ( bill paxton ) , a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond , lost during the sinking . somewhere inside the ship , lovett s crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead . here , in the shape of a nude young lady , is a window into the distant age of 1912 . lovett is extremely surprised when he get s a phone call from rose dawson , claiming that she is a model . she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel , and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years . as the memories come flooding back , she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer ( kate winslet ) , the fiancée of wealthy cal hockley ( billy zane ) and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater ( frances fisher ) . on board there are rich and poor , everyone trust in the ship s designer ( jonathan hyde ) and her master , captain e . j . smith ( bernard hill ) . on board the ship , rose , unhappy and restless meets jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) - a young american artist , poor , brave and attractive . a love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes , but also face the greatest power on earth - death . cameron could as well have called his picture " the never ending love " or " love at first sight " , as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple , and not on the disaster itself . the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap-opera . the director doesn t even try to overcome his empty script . because of its primitive and predictable plot , titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking . russel carpenter s rich , majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award-worthy . everything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch . but it doesn t help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them . the actors are not to blame , because their characters are more like caricatures , in other words - fake . jack is a man with many talents : he is a talented artist , handsome , brave , honest , strong , funny . . . you name it . he doesn t have any dark side , he doesn t make any mistakes , that for a second would make him human . jack is perfect , but he is - poor . on the other hand we have cal . he is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife-to-be . he lacks everything jack possesses , but he is -- rich . this childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture . cameron knows precisely what we want to see . his film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience - attractive actors , a " tragic love story " , beautiful visuals ( including expensive special effects ) , a dose of social criticism , a fascinating historical event ( we love true stories ) and last , but not least - an incredible media support , which proclaimed an average picture the " greatest film of all time " . on the outside titanic looks perfect , but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals - is emptiness - nothing to think about . the main weakness of this film , which ironically became its success , is simplicity . cameron enables our basic and if you wish - primitive emotions : love , hate , fear and helplessness . everyone understands the power of love and the threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable - a sinking ship . titanic is a typical hollywood production , totally and completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primitive plot . it s a good picture , but absolutely not a masterpiece . it s among hundreds and thousands good films released every year , not better or worse than the average american film . '
positiveC,' call me crazy , but i don t see saving private ryan as the film of the summer . a good movie , yes , with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare . an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg s best work , no . personally , if i was spielberg , i wouldn t go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler s list and the indiana jones movies . i m guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn t be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika-wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie . all lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick . the difference is , it s easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon s chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it s damn hard to sit and eat reese s pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield . and believe me , there s plenty of it . a 30-minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain ( tom hanks ) and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire . lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on , and all the young men in the audience find themselves never , ever wanting to be drafted . cut to some bureaucratic defense office , where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties . one woman happens upon an interesting detail -- three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat , and their mother is getting the telegram today . i guess it s an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother , so the army chief ( harve presnell ) sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission , to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home . that way , the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs . ryan . one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it s a mission designed to make the army look good . they question the worth of risking eight soldiers  lives to save one , and hanks  character admits he doesn t give a damn about ryan ; he s just following orders . if this was a john wayne movie , things would be different . there d be a phony , " let s go get that boy , gosh darn it ! " attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war . by doing things this way , spielberg admits the instincts of self- preservation and complacency that every normal person has . it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone-driven stallone movie mission . the movie s pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi-introspective conversation among the soldiers . hanks is painted first as a nails-tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men . it s not that way for long . edward burns , the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isn t available , is the impulsive one . jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time , and so on . none of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes , but was spielberg s obvious intention . i wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long , how were they going to fill three hours  time searching for one person and still make it interesting ? there are a few false starts ; hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson s company ( apparently , danson joined the army after " ink " was canceled . ) and breaks the bad news before learning it s the wrong ryan . and of course the movie s far from over when hanks does locate ryan ( matt damon , the other guy you get when affleck isn t available ) . that s when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick , although body parts and limbs still fly like never before . saving private ryan is worth your time , but it s definitely no schindler s list . the battle scenes are intense and realistic , but some of the attempts at sincere emotion aren t . the movie s bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place , when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out , whining , " tell me i ve led a good life . tell me i m a good man . " spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any three-hour movie about the past should be framed by a self-contained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present . much more effective are subtler scenes , like the one where several of hanks  men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers , and they make light of what they re doing by pretending they re playing poker . this while an airborne division marches by , their eyes full of that mound of dogtags . by not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war , the audience gets the message . and even if it s not a classic , saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there . visit the movie critic at large homepage at http : //www . missouri . edu/~c667778/movies . html close to 1 , 000 reviews with a comedic flair . . .

positiveC,' director :   john lasseter , andrew stanton cast :   dave foley , kevin spacey , julia louis-dreyfuss , david hyde pierce , madeline kahn , denis leary screenplay :   andrew stanton , donald mcenery , bob shaw producers :  darla k . anderson , kevin reher runtime :    95 min . us distribution :   disney/buena vista rated g once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon . here we are now , just a few months later , and they re at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug s life . what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution . i mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ? as was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug s life is far superior . in fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug s life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything . but it s not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison . a bug s life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs . in fact , it s one of the best films this year : it s smart , subtle , and funny , but it s also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining . i haven t had such a good time at the movies in months . it tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he s a nice guy , but he s also a troublemaker . the ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers . just before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper s leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they re all dead . flick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them . he heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) . flick doesn t know they re actors , and they don t know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position . the most obvious element of a bug s life is the quality of animation . created by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug s life has some of the most amazing visuals i ve ever seen . the bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action . this is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs  world is innovative . the film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes  escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) . but the makers of a bug s life know where the importance lies : story and characters . flick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story . but the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they re such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar . all of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory . in my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence . in concept , a bug s life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn t like about it . with such strong work in both animation and script , a bug s life is nothing but a joy to sit through . it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug s life is so good that i m sure it will find its audience . after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it s downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty .

positiveC,'  the thing about adam sandler is , his heart is in the right place . for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro . if the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house . that extra motive doesn t make happy gilmore a funnier movie . it doesn t really add any genuine emotional depth , either . in fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie . but sandler s philosophy seems to be , if it s a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ? that is endlessly refreshing . in the wedding singer , sandler is right on track . the fact that he s a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story . what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important . david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm . he could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact . but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character . he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family . robbie hart ( sandler ) doesn t just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing . he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding . the day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy-metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 ) . robbie takes it hard . he doesn t sleep , he doesn t eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings " love stinks " at a wedding . julia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to . eventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia . he really likes her , but she s engaged . her fiancé is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn t deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand . julia seems to like robbie too , but she can t leave her seemingly safe and stable fiancé for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her . you know the story . you ve seen it a million times before . there s always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it s the same story . and sometimes , it works .

positiveC,' capsule : a love story hidden inside a half-serious thriller , and the love story comes out on top . a friend of my mother s is a compulsive collector of odd trivia . one night she came back after a cab ride with six photocopied pages of closely-packed conspiracy theory gibberish , which the cabdriver had apparently foisted off on her after lecturing her about the evils of technology . i guess both she and screenwriter brian helgeland must ve ridden in the same cab , because conspiracy theory takes that kernel of an idea , wraps a love story around it , and milks it quite nicely . the cabbie in the movie is named jerry fletcher , and is played by mel gibson . so many of his previous roles featured him playing intensely masculine and assertive roles , so it comes as a shock when we see him gibbering and waving his fingers around like squid s tentacles and motormouthing his way through the opening credits about everything from what they put into the water to who killed jfk . he s a nut . he s also a nut with a case of puppy-dog erotomania , and the object of his affection is a woman who works in the justice department -- alice sutton , whose father , a judge , died under bizarre circumstances . fletcher and sutton know each other : he comes to her office with another wacko theory every week , and she tolerates his presence , if only because he saved her from some muggers once . but she s clearly only going to take so much of him at a time , and she s not charmed by him . at least at first . one day fletcher comes under the attention of some shadowy characters , and is abducted and put through a serio-comic chamber of horrors that makes the " dentist s chair " scene in marathon man look positively comforting . after that , he s no longer just kooky -- he s charged with the convinction that someone really is after him . convincing alice , on the other hand , is another story . the plot unspools in several directions at once , but it doesn t come up with anything that leaves us tearing out the cushions of our seats in amazement : the movie isn t working in that direction . the timing in every scene is comic , and the relationship between jerry and alice is like a mutant version of a screwball comedy where the society dame is pestered by the resourceful grocery boy . it is , at heart , a relatively sweet-natured story . sounds strange considering that a good deal of the plot concerns stuff which almost any other movie would have made x-files-bleak and blade runner-black , but the movie tries something neat and for the most part makes it . who d ve thunk it : a date movie about mk-ultra ?

positiveC,' directed by keenen ivory wayans . screenplay by phil beauman , jason friedberg , buddy johnson , aaron seltzer , marlon wayans , shawn wayans . starring anna faris , marlon wayans , regina hall . running time : 86 minutes . rated aa for mature subject matter and offensive language by the mfcb . reviewed on july 7th , 2000 . how do you review a film like " scary movie " ? certainly not on the basis of plot . the " story " of a spoof is usually just a framework for gags -- to assess it on that criterion would be like judging a dress on the quality of the hanger . acting isn t really all that important either , as long as the performers possess a certain amount of charisma and some notion of comic timing . direction ? virtually irrelevant . cinematography ? get real . no , all that matters in deciding whether or not " scary movie " is any good are the laughs . and " scary movie " is the first parody i ve seen in years that has laughs in droves . but fair warning first : i m a big fan of the " naked gun " movies . i enjoyed " spaceballs " . if your sense of humor runs contrary to my own , this review likely won t apply much to you . " scary movie " started life as two separate screenplays -- " scream if you know what i did last halloween " and " last summer i screamed because friday the 13th fell on halloween " -- which were merged into one by director keenen ivory wayans . ironically , the final moniker was a working title for " scream " , the progenitor of the current crop of teen-oriented slasher films . if you haven t already guessed , " scary movie " is a pastiche of this whole genre . if you ve been avoiding these sorts of pictures , you might want to give this one a pass too , as you might not get many of the jokes . the storyline of " scary movie " broadly follows the plot of " scream " , with elements of other films ( notably " scream 2 " and " i know what you did last summer " ) thrown in for good measure . we again start off with a big star making popcorn . in " scream " it was drew barrymore ( playing " casey becker " ) , here it s carmen electra ( playing " drew becker " , wink wink ) . the phone rings , and sure enough it s a serial killer on the other line , wearing the same ghostface get-up as in " scream " . the voice on the phone wants to know what the noise is . carmen explains she just farted . the killer was referring to the popcorn . soon carmen is racing through the house and across her lawn . she comes to a signpost with arrows reading " safety " and " death " pointing in opposite directions . you can probably guess the rest . the movie plays out predictably from there , as teens are stalked and slain by the masked villain -- or is it villains ? but , really , who cares about the story ? it barely even makes sense , and the ending is particularly incredulous . what is important is the way " scary movie " subverts its source material , and this it does very well . the " father death " mask , for instance , has gained the miraculous ability to reflect its owner s mood , generating some bizarre visuals when the killer is toquing up . toward the end , the ( ? ) murderer does a terrific imitation of matthew lillard , one of " scream "  s homicidal teenagers . " scary movie " doesn t just target the slasher genre , either . everything from " the matrix " to " dawson s creek " is up for grabs here , and there are some great send-ups of human behaviour . one of my favourite scenes has black actress regina hall attending a showing of " shakespeare in love " . in a terrific pastiche of rude moviegoers ( and , in particular , the reputation african-americans have of talking back to the screen ) , hall just doesn t stop chattering . she even talks on her cell phone , loudly , to the disgust of the all-white , upper-middle-class crowd . ghostface slinks into the audience to stab hall , but the audience gets to her first , pulling out their own weapons . " this is for  schindler s list  ! " exclaims a hassidic jew . you ll have to hear for yourself what film hall ruined for the pope . ( when i saw " scary movie " , there was a moron waving a laser pointer across the screen during certain scenes -- the first time i ve encountered this particular brand of rudeness at a local theatre . intriguingly , they stopped doing it after the scene i ve just described . coincidence ? ) not all the jokes are winners , though , and " scary movie " is hamstrung by following the plot of " scream " a little too closely ; greater variation would have made for a funnier , more dynamic film . some of the humor is rather tired -- the gag of giving the characters cutesy , referential names ( " buffy " gilmore ) was even done already in " scream 3 " . and sometimes " scary movie " just doesn t know when enough is enough , like the running gag about ray ( shawn wayans ) being a closet homosexual . furthermore , whereas the truly great spoofs set you up with an obvious joke , then knock you down by taking it one step further , " scary movie " is often content to go only halfway . a parody of the confession scene from " the blair witch project " , for example , is an awful lot like every other " blair witch " parody of the past year . no doubt the most controversial aspect of " scary movie " will be the sheer explicitness of many jokes . remember two years ago , when the " franks and beans " scene in " there s something about mary " was considered groundbreaking ? well , there s a " franks and beans " scene about every fifteen minutes here , although for the most part they re pretty amusing , fortunately . consequently , parents may want to be wary of letting younger children attend " scary movie " . it strikes me as a movie for strictly high school age at minimum , and even that might be pushing it . amongst the cast , the only real standout is newcomer anna faris , playing sidney -- er , cindy campbell , succeeding impressively at portraying the virginal heroine while uttering and engaging in sheer filth . it s almost eerie . otherwise , the castmembers are basically just vehicles for the jokes . there aren t characters here , just ciphers and cliches . yes indeed , " scary movie " is plotless , crude , and possessed of mostly marginal performances -- all the things film critics are supposed to abhor . but did i laugh my ass off anyway ? you bet i did . do i recommend " scary movie " ? god help me , yes . copyright © 2000 shannon patrick sullivan . archived at the popcorn gallery , http : //www . physics . mun . ca/~sps/movies/scarymovie . html _______________________________________________________________________ / shannon patrick sullivan | " we are all in the gutter , but some of us \ | shannon@mun . ca | are looking at the stars .

positiveC,' what if one of our cities became the target for terror ? what can we do ? what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism ? what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster ? so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world . it is the land of opportunities . it is the land of freedom . but what if it became the new target ? this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality . when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice . the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : " release him . " then all hell breaks loose in new york . a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians . a broadway theater is bombed . hostages are taken at a school . as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law . devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil . another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities . his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o ! f moronic feds we re used to seeing in movies . hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they re willing to reveal . but the attacks escalate . the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy . the land is under siege . they have lost control . . a terror is coming from within . . what s great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life . it reflects reality . and that s why it makes such an impact . edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season . the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously . and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective . he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u . s . government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia ) . he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved . the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii . there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the " greater good . " in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom . was that what the terror ! ists really wanted ? this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u . s . and n . y . especially . but to me these protests seem unnecessary . zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys . the script is therefore wonderfully balanced . agent hubbard s best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese-american . and it is quite often you hear lines such as " my first boyfriend was palestinian . they seduce you with their suffering " or " they love this country as much as we do . " but no matter how you twist this matter , you won t get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab-speaking population who are in the great majority . more to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab-americans by the u . s . military . and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any ! way . denzel washington is dashing as always . in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual . anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage , a network of snitches and seduction to gather information . . bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist , hungry for power , that never looses his connection with the audience , since his point of view is not too hard to understand . the film is elegantly shaped . the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong . zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension , horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism . he tightens the intensity as the events progress . and when a plot twist comes , it actually is surprising . it is not a film drained in patriotism , like the work of roland emerich . nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values . it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey . it has courage enough to get involved in politics . it questions our foreign policies , mentality and defense . i must admit that it ends rather disappointing , as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down . but despite of that , it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts ; a virtue that few summer films can boast of . " this is the u . s . army . it s a broadsword , not a scalpel . believe me , you do not want us in an american city " - gen . william devereaux , " the siege " '
positiveC,' the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey s dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen . in case you ve been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven . his life seems so perfect , however , because it s controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of . that s right , burbank s life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it s inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage . the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . . with an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator . luckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie . talking of carrey , he s perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career . his character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey s persona . he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey . he s not completely dramatic like the film promises , however . ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show . quiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer . unfortunately , he s barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen t appear at all ! also disappointing is natascha mcelhone s character sylvia . she plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her . the supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it s creepy . the philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film . peter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun . the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card . although it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll . sadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam . also , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing . the screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim . while christoff s plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do . also , there s some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show . overall , the truman show is excellent entertainment . certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone . it offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed .

" boy , did you ever pick the wrong guy on the wrong day , " beam mutters with a deadly little smile , and floors it . one scarifying ride later , the two of them take stock in a diner far outside the city . they don t like each other , but they re forced to rely on each other when the land rover runs out of gas and paul sticks up a gas station to fill it up . bit by bit , beam s story comes out . . . along with a bizarre plan to get revenge on his boss by robbing him blind . the movie s a pastiche of recent comedy cliches , and there s no point in ignoring it . what s different is that the movie is funny . most comedies that try to play this kind of mix-and-match don t work ; they strike the wrong notes , or make the heroes into idiots . both beam and paul know what s what , which makes them interesting to watch : you wonder what they re going to do next . in one scene , they rob a sporting-goods store , and what could have been a routine stick-em-up turns into a heated competition over who had the more intimidating stickup style . martin lawrence is an odd duck . i can t figure out if i like him or hate him , but i liked him in this movie : he does things with his voice and face that shouldn t be physically possible , which is half the reason for the laughs he gets . the other half is his timing and attitude : pay attention to the scene where he dresses down beam for not having a tighter grip on his wife ( and beam s reaction , too ) . or the scene where he tries to tell beam he s in danger , and gets shrugged off . ultimately , the cliches win in nothing to lose , but that doesn t mean the ride isn t enjoyable . my basic rule of thumb for comedy is : did i laugh ? yeah -- a lot more than i probably should have , but i can t say that about most movies . and the scene with the security guard goth-dancing in the laser vault has to be seen to be believed .

positiveC,' starring : robert duvall , farrah fawcett , john beasley , miranda richardson ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , churchsynopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy . in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy s head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids . to atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny s main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station . soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple . but sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him . opinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms . i believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film . duvall s portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs . incidentally , in real life duvall was just as  driven  in getting the project underway . since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) . in terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film . similarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience . on the other hand , the apostle s main strength - - duvall s preaching - - is also what limits the apostle s target audience . in terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone . teenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church . in other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience .

positiveC,' directed by yuen woo ping starring jackie chan , hwang jang lee , simon yuen , dean shek mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest " hot properties " in action adventure stardom , and it s just about time . for over twenty-five years , jackie s been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . " drunken master " has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to " make it big " --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . i m not entirely sure why , exactly . in many ways , " drunken master " is similar to most of jackie s other early films , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii , " master with cracked fingers " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , " spiritual kung fu " , and others . in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . they re quite different from action movies as we know them in america . these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . " drunken master " , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . ( as an aside , " drunken master " was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . at the time , i didn t really think it was anything special . . . but after having seen more films like it , it s kind of grown on me . ) " drunken master "  s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii and " master with cracked fingers " --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been " adapted , " to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka " naughty panther , " a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . after embarrassing his instructor s assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . then , when he s ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . " drunken master " features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . it s been said before , but i ll say it again--these fights don t just _happen_ , they re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . whether jackie wins or loses , it s really something to see . . . and it s often as funny as anything , too . and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . there s very little that s new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these schticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . but they re still hilarious as ever . likewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . the really big thing about " drunken master " , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . i m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and it apparently helps if you re drunk while you re doing it . genuine or not , i have to admit , there s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what s going on . come to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film s success over any of the other jackie films . . . it s not just martial arts , it s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , " whoa . . . " on the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . " gone with the wind " , this isn t . still , if you like martial arts films , or like what you ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . it s much more " real " than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . you might very well like it . another interesting thing about " drunken master " has to do with its video availability in the us . " drunken master " is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . there are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . thankfully , " drunken master " , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . if you like " drunken master " , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren t really _too_ bad . . . if nothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . i particularly recommend " spiritual kung fu " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , the " fearless hyena " movies , and " snake & crane arts of shaolin " . also , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , " drunken master ii " , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . also , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i ve been told to suggest the " once upon a time in china " series starring jet li ( though i haven t personally seen any of them yet ) . if you choose to watch " drunken master " , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that s out there . all in all , i give this film an 8 out of 10 . -- chris meadows aka | author , team m . e . c . h . a . , crapshoot & co . robotech_master | on the superguy listserv ( bit . listserv . superguy ) robotech@eyrie . org | with a world wide web homepage located at robotech@jurai . net | http : //www . eyrie . org/~robotech/index . html '
positiveC,' well i ll be damned , what a most excellent surprise . not to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex-porn star traci lords , this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950 s drive-in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci-fi flick of 1995 . once again , b-movie king roger corman is behind this effort ( he directed the original ) but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer . the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns . it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries , because it s an absolute must-see for sci-fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent . the plot in brief . paul johnson ( michael york ) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who , though needing to kill people to live , is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons . his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure , the key of which lies in the blood of humans . he visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr . rochelle , whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf . he also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda ( elizabeth barondes ) to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires . but before long , amanda and johnson s sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric . i must admit , my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging . british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades , a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat ( 1972 ) . but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding . the weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech , the dapper clothes and cool spectacles , the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character . york is by turns hilarious , menacing and tragic . this is a tour-de-force and quite simply the best performance i ve seen from him . and while obviously made on a modest budget , the film boasts enormous strengths . the casting is spot on , the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent , witty and consistently engaging , cleverly updating the original . the balance of horror and humour is just about perfect , a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988 . the film doesn t drag for a second of its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of little-known director terrance h . winkless . and it doesn t matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy - this is schlock after all , even if it is high class schlock . in fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end . tighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their life-threatening situation . but these are minor complaints . just see it . not of this earth is one of the biggest sci-fi surprises in years . and michael york : in one cool swoop you ve made yourself a b-movie legend , dude .

positiveC,' no , you will * not * believe in ghosts after seeing ghost , unless you were predisposed to believe in them already . but , you will see a movie that is a wonderful blend of love story , thriller , and comedy . and , yes , i think it worked . the plot is simple , though it has a few interesting twists . patrick swayze and demi moore move into a big old loft apartment . swayze is in finance at a bank , and moore is a sculptor . swayze is murdered , and his ghost runs into the movie . while it appears to be a random killing at first , the ghost learns that one of his co-workers was out to get some computer security codes , and that he may now be out to get moore . in order to reach moore , he finds whoopi goldberg , a " spiritualist . " the movie is at its best when it plays with people s beliefs about ghosts and the afterlife . goldberg is a charlatan until swayze finds her , and she isn t sure what to do with him . moore desperately wants to believe that goldberg has contacted swayze , but the evidence is stacked against her . and swayze wants to reach moore , in order to save her life , but he can t contact her directly , since he s a ghost . this is * not * an " actors  " movie . whoopi goldberg is on hand , playing her classic smart-mouthed , street-wise broad with an attitude and she s a hoot . both patrick swayze and demi moore are ernest , adorable , and moving . a character actor who played one of the patients in cuckoo s nest and one of salieri s servants in amadeus gives a great performance of a ghost trapped in the new york subway . the biggest flaw in this movie is the editing . many scenes run on too long . the director and film editor should have shaven about 10-20 minutes from the movie , and would have made a better , tighter movie .

positiveC,' hong kong action star chow yun-fat is a living legend , and it s about time that mainstream america found out . the ever-charismatic chow will certainly have no trouble winning new fans with his english language debut , antoine fuqua s brisk , explosive the replacement killers . in comparison to the dark , complex collaborations with john woo ( who executive produced ) that made chow an international superstar , replacement is not exactly the sturdiest of vehicles . the entire storyline of ken sanzel s thin script can be summed up by its title . chow plays john lee , a hitman who wants out of a contract with his mob boss employer ( kenneth tsang ) , who hence dispatches " replacements " to kill him and his ally , a document forger named meg coburn ( a game mira sorvino , running around in an open shirt ) . the plot is just the glue that holds together what is essentially one long series of wildly choreographed gunfights , which is far from a bad thing . fuqua , whose slick style is best described as a cross between michael bay and ( of course ) woo , wisely lets chow be chow--in other words , do all the things that makes him the coolest actor around . throughout the film , i found myself breathing sighs of relief as the outrageous derring-do from the chow i know and love appeared onscreen--sliding on floors , flying through the air , rolling around and flipping , firing from each hand . early on , though , fuqua makes a serious miscalculation by having chow hold a gun with both hands ( believe it or not , columbia pictures reportedly brought in someone to teach trigger-happy chow how to shoot a gun ) , and his discomfort is obvious . but there is only one scene where he does so , and soon after chow is allowed to ease into his normal routine . as well as chow is serviced by the replacement killers , it still only scratches the surface of his talent . his dour role erases all traces of his appealing sense of humor ; fuqua , perhaps caught up in his reverence for the man , takes chow s character a bit _too_ seriously , sometimes eliciting an odd chuckle from the audience . and the depth of his dramatic range is only hinted at in the silent , subtly acted scene where lee cannot go through with what is to be his last hit . but i suppose all depth will have to be reserved for when chow reunites with woo ( which he is slated to do in the forthcoming action comedy king s ransom ) . until then , replacement will do . it delivers all the mayhem and thrills one would want--and expect--from a popcorn action film and serves as a perfectly adequate american introduction to the living legend that is chow yun-fat .

positiveC,' captain corelli s mandolin is one of those films that most people can t in good conscience say they hate . in the tradition of films like waking ned devine and cinema paradiso , it s a sweet but flawed wartime romance with enough gorgeous scenery and quaint villagers to choke a horse . it innocuously celebrates the triumph of true love , exalts the rise of an everyman hero , toasts art s ability to eclipse the horrors of life , and at times is even a visual feast ( miramax should charge the greek tourist board royalties ) . adapted from the best-selling novel by louis de bernieres , the story begins in 1941 . dr . iannis ( john hurt ) and his lovely daughter pelagia ( penélope cruz ) live on the idyllic greek isle of cephallonia , where pelagia is betrothed to fisherman mandras ( christian bale ) who s eager to prove his mettle in the growing war in europe . he goes off to fight for greece against the italians ; in the meantime , the italians invade his home island . but these italians aren t scary , mussolini types ; they re jolly , good-natured and even kind . according to them , italians are best at " eating , singing , and making love , " which the filmmakers set out to prove to no end in this movie . let s put it this way : puccini gets some serious screen time . when the opera-crooning captain corelli ( nicholas cage ) -- beloved mandolin in hand -- is placed in dr . iannis  home as a boarder , he and pelagia fall in love . all seems wonderful , especially when word arrives that mussolini has surrendered to the allies . the italians are ready to go home , but in handing over their arms to the still-fighting germans , some of the fun-loving italians get shot . soon , corelli and his men are working with the resistance to help liberate the island and avenge their brothers  deaths . but , can these few men defeat a huge nazi onslaught ? can true love prevail ? don t be so certain of the answer , but don t expect miracles either . films about love and war should have pathos and grit , and corelli s gives us smatterings of each . unfortunately , those glimmers are smothered by incredulously bad , syrupy dialogue ( " i feel i could ve watched you forever . " ) and ludicrous -- almost comic -- accents . the performances are all passable , but americans and brits posing as italians and greeks can be too much to bear at times . cage seems to channeling a toned-down roberto benigni , exclaiming " bella bambina ! " every time he catches sight of cruz . and christian bale as a swarthy greek revolutionary ? that casting decision is pure comedy . while it s not remotely as bad as pearl harbor , the war here is basically a nice device to teach us the important lesson of acceptance . we re all not so different ( well , except maybe the nazis , but everyone hates them , right ? ) . greeks , italians , and germans can remarkably understand each other . . . in their accented english , of course , and these cultural exchanges are where the film s painless platitudes come to light . oddly , corelli s does provide quite a bit of gruesome battle footage and its fair share of brutal death , which gives you quite a jolt after watching an hour of bucolic harmony , italians singing happily , lovers cooing at one another , and " bella bambina ! " it s a welcome shock back to reality . but with the billing of " from the director of shakespeare in love , " one would hope john madden s follow-up would have touted the same witty , incisive and radiant dialogue as its predecessor , but this script is made of lead . instead of clever , we re treated to cliché with a thick artsy varnish , and there s certainly a big audience for that . too bad he couldn t get tom stoppard to bail him out this time .

positiveC,' starring : judith hoag ( april o neil ) , elias koteas ( casey jones ) , a bunch of guys in turtle suits directed by : steve barron , written by : todd w . langen , based on a story by : kevin eastman , peter laird , and bobby herbeck rated pg by the mpaa for violence and mild language . well folks , last week i went to go check out the replacement killers . not a bad flick , thanks largely to chow yun-fat . however , when i saw it , i also saw the trailer for wild things with kevin bacon , neve campbell , and denise richards . i fell ill at this . i have never seen a more idiotic-looking film trailer in all my life . this is worse than batman & robin s trailer . this film looks like the total scum of the movie world . if it grosses dollar one in its opening weekend , i ll have to fear for humanity . naturally , this turned me off to going to the theater for a little bit , in fear of seeing it again ( cue cold chill running down my spine here ) . i ll go back for dark city , but right now it s just stay home , watch tv , yadda yadda . and lo and behold , what s this ? why it s 1990 s teenage mutant ninja turtles film . and you know what ? i m going to shock you all by saying this , but it s not a bad film at that . in fact , it s pretty fun . i remember seeing these turtle flicks before . this would be the good one . a nice , dark vision of new york ( quite the cool production design ) , and of course , four turtles and a rat . if you don t know the old story of the " green machine , " it goes like this - a glass jar with four baby turtles fell into the sewer and shattered , leaving them to crawl around in some radioactive ooze that was coming out of a nearby cannister that also fell down there . so , when a rat from japan ( whose owner had recently been killed after moving to america , leaving him to crawl through the sewer ) comes across the turtles and decides to take care of them , it gets some ooze on himself , too , and of course , they all grow and become intelligent . the rat teaches the turtles the martial arts and he saw his previous master practice so many times before , and gives them all names of renaissance artists : lenardo , raphael , michaelangelo , and donatello . oh , and the rat s named splinter . i don t know why . in the course of this movie , they also become friends with a judith hoag who plays the new reporter april o neil , and with another avenger of justice , who happens to have a fetish for sports equipment , named casey jones . that s elias koteas . and of course , there happens to be this huge crime wave sweeping new york , crimes committed by the japanese foot clan , which is led by the mysterious man known as the shredder ( james saito , voiced by david mccharen ) . who s gonna stop this ? i ll give you three guesses , and the first two don t count . this whole thing sounds like a bad troma ( tm ) film , but it turns out to be pretty fun . the turtles all have discernable personalities , and they re fun ones at that . they tend to make a lot of jokes , and just about all of the wisecracks hit home . it s not just a bunch of now-old-news pop culture references , as i remember the third film being chock-full of . this is stuff that could actually still seem funny years from now . koteas makes a memorable role himself here , if not an entirely fulfilling one - he could ve used more screen time . hoag is also good in her part , doing a fine job at portraying the disbelieving friend of the large reptiles . but the real stars here are the turtles , and rightfully so . the technical expertise on display in the turtles  ( and splinter s ) suits is still impressive now , eight years later . the facial expressions they get out of these animatronic outfits are amazing . to this day , the only thing to top this or come close would be the mangalores in the fifth element . this was all done thanks to jim henson s workshop of puppeteers . henson died two months after this film was released . though his family and many others still work to make his legacy live on , this movie is just another reason why he will be missed . another great thing about this show ? it s so damn loyal its roots . the original ( four ? ) issues of eastman and laird s dark teenage mutant ninja turtles comic book are replicated pretty faithfully by the movie s plot - now there s something you don t see very often in comic films today . this sure kicks the pants off of a comic-based movie like batman & robin . sure , the blood is gone , and there s more humor - and the turtles wear different colored masks - but otherwise , this follows that original series nicely down to the big finish . so go on , don t be afraid , i don t care how old you are - if you have the time , check out teenage mutant ninja turtles . you might want to avoid the sequels unless you really love the turtles . incidentally , what was with tatsu s ( toshirô obata , voiced by michael mcconnohie ) funky hand signals when he said " go , play " to that one kid in the warehouse ? that just killed me . unintentional comedy there , i d say . if you can never watch any film with such a premise , refuse to accept it , or just hate these turtles , then you can drop my rating down about 1/2 a star or maybe a full star . if you re a huge turtle fan ( i don t think there s any of those left . . . hello ? hello out there ? ) then you can add on another 1/2 star . but if you re like me , and you re in the mood for a weird , fun time . . .

positiveC,' wilde ( uk , 1997 ) 1/3 directed by brian gilbert . written by julian mitchell , from the book " oscar wilde " by richard ellmann . photography , martin fuhrer . editing , michael bradsell . production design , maria djurkovic . music , debbie wiseman ; produced by marc samuelson & peter samuelson . cast : stephen fry ( oscar wilde ) , jude law ( lord alfred douglas ) , vanessa redgrave ( lady speranza wilde ) , jennifer ehle ( constance wilde ) , gemma jones ( lady queensberry ) , judy parfitt ( lady mount-temple ) , michael sheen ( robert ross ) , zoe wanamaker ( ada leverson ) , tom wilkinson ( the marquess of queensberry ) . a sony classics release . 116 minutes . r ( sex , full rear male nudity ) because i take for granted that oscar wilde the writer , the man and his wit are familiar to the film s potential public , i will not go into a general intro . wilde s homosexuality ( a crime under english law until the late 1960s ) , his famous affair with lord alfred douglas , and the ensuing trials that finished off poor oscar , have made him a " cause celebre " --if i am not mistaken , the first of that nature in modern history . understandably , all this has made of wilde a patron saint of gay artists . among the many cinema genres , few can be as difficult and as vulnerable to criticism as the biographical picture . biopics are compromises . to relate a life -- or part of one -- and remain faithful to history in two hours of film is an impossibility , one that is even nastier than screen adaptations of major novels . condensations , simplifications , selected episodes are unavoidable . a case in point is the set of biopics directed by william dieterle in the 1930s and early 1940s . they were all reverent works on major figures : louis pasteur ( with paul muni , oscared ) , florence nightingale , emile zola ( best picture 1937 , also with muni ) , juarez ( with muni ) , reuter ( with e . g . robinson ) , dr . erlich ( robinson ) well-made , using major actors in both main and supporting roles , these works were big popular hits in their time . but today , with audiences and critics , movies in that style would get a much more cautious reception . even the sacrosanct epic " napoleon " ( 1927 , by abel gance ) might be --but is not-- faulted for historical inaccuracies . dieterle and his likes represented the old school of biopics . after a transition period ( e . g . wilson , the desert fox , viva zapata ) came the new school , in which no two of the better films followed the same strategy . creative and unconventional treatments days were given so such masterful works as --and i cite a few pell-mell --raging bull , van gogh , chaplin , joe hill , lenny , lawrence of arabia , malcolm x , tous les matins du monde , vincent and theo , stevie , camille claudel , rosa luxemburg , hanussen , an angel at my table , ed wood . . . although wilde , was not an easy item to tackle , it acquits itself honorably . there must have been good rapport between director and writer . brian gilbert , who made the funny , witty vice versa , the underrated not without my daughter , then tom and viv , opted here for a masterpiece theatre/ivory-merchant style , unrevolutionary but fitting the subject . versatile novelist-playwright julian mitchell is the author of many scenarios , including those of arabesque , another country , vincent and theo , august ( the directorial debut of anthony hopkins ) -- not to mention nine episodes of that civilized delight , the inspector morse tv series . mitchell had already worked on another gay theme i know of , in his prize-winning stage-play another country which is about 1930s students public-school students for whom homosexuality was trendy . years later , as in the notorious guy burgess and donald maclean case , several government officials were found spying for the soviet union . a very good film was made of this . it starred rupert everett . the script was by mitchell . for the current movie --the third about wilde-- mitchell based his scenario on the admirable biography by richard ellmann . the great scholar and critic finished this long labor of love as he was dying of lou gehrig  s disease . he died in march 1987 . the book appeared in early 1988 . there is no way for a film script to reconstruct a 680-page volume . the scenario wisely opted for selective choices and inspirations . it is faithful to ellmann s belief that wilde was as original and major a writer , and a cultural influence , as he was a man who invented his own public persona , as wit , esthete , dandy , poseur , society lion and , among much else , a sly critic of the middle and upper classes of england , the very people who were the butt of wilde s plays yet applauded them . the film does not go into wilde s irish and english past and upbringing . it plunges right away into an already established oscar who marries constance . his wife , in older parlance " gave him two boys " . robert ross , a younger houseguest , reveals to wilde that he ( oscar ) is really a homosexual . a relationship starts between the two . it is followed by others , culminates in the love affair between wilde and handsome , some 20 years younger lord alfred douglas ( " bosie " ) . it s a bizarre affair . oscar s love is steadfast , while the capricious , self-spoiled bosie blows hot and cold , introduces oscar to lower class people , often insults , hurts , exploits , taunts him and is despicable . he flaunts their couple in public , also taunts his father . the latter , played by tom wilkinson --who has a very different role in the full monty-- is here the wealthy marquess of queensberry , a crude , rude , violent sportsman whom bosie hates . ( he is the same lord queensberry after whom the basic codes for boxing were named , although another sportsman wrote them ) . delightful is the movie s inclusion of some aspects of wilde s enormously growing fame as a playwright , plus much wildean humor , wit , and the expected wildean thoughts and epigrams . but concurrently as well as exponentially , we see the sadness of the man s public and private life , the unavoidable troubles and scandals . the tragedy , latent throughout the writer s life , now springs out of the closet . it becomes all the more painful to watch since wilde is a most likable fellow , generous to a fault , and never really inflicting harm or hurt on others . actor stephen fry is an uncanny match for wilde . he even looks like him , though taller , less rotund , and with a face not so soft as in the photographs of wilde . fry , also a writer and a wit , temperamental , unpredictable , rather sweet , openly gay , is a rare case of perfect casting . superior too is the casting of lord alfred douglas and that of robert ross . robbie remains through thick and thin oscar s true friend and helper , and the voice of reason . because we know how everything comes out , the earlier and/or some lighter scenes are made suspenseful as we wait for the axe to fall . and we wish that the so-smart oscar had not been so dumb as to be prodded by bosie into initiating that terrible libel suit against queensberry . if there was a time when " don t ask , don t tell " was the best possible advice , it was in victorian days .

" " mouse hunt " is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim -- but it s hardly ever mean-spirited . the star of the show is neither the top-billed lane nor the titular mouse . it s lanky british comedian evans , whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned-up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill ( note a toned-down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease ) ; evans  banter with the ever-affable lane is funny stuff , too , and holds its own against the movie s more flashy physical shtick . vicki lewis ( beth from " newsradio " ) is solid in a supporting role as lars  money-grubbing wife . and in a nifty bit of novelty casting , christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously , popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a " calcium deficiency . " blech . a basically one-joke idea -- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans -- is given a rather engaging execution . their sparring is imaginatively realized ( i don t think i ll ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda ) , and although you really never fully root for either side , that s okay -- a warm-and-fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share . " mouse hunt " may take a while to get going ( the rather lengthy set-up could test the patience of some of the younger children , although i rather liked it , much in part to lane and evans ) , and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long , but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable , not unlike the original " home alone .

" love the love , not the man , " as her mother told her . " dangerous beauty , " which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice . it has multiple plot lines -- including veronica s adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france s military assistance in venice s battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing . much of the film s success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role . known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson s ire in " braveheart " ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady . she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes . the rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in " dark city " have assured him a solid place in hollywood . he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas . oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy . platt is a good actor , but he s just too hard to hate . jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco s uncle . " dangerous beauty " is marshall herskovitz s sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film " jack the bear . " partnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( " thirtysomething , " " my so-called life " ) and in the movies ( " legends of the fall " ) . his directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions . he could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids . " dangerous beauty " contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative . herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller " kalifornia " ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara s dark sci-fi film " body snatchers " ( 1994 ) . bazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery . however , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( " brazil , " " the princess bride " ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( " the age of innocence " ) . the only problem with " dangerous beauty " is that it doesn t stick with you . it s a good story well-told with interesting characters , but it s easy to shrug off once you ve left the theater . the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it s simply too melodramatic and conventional . herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter , but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion , and like the rest of the film , it carries no real weight , despite the potential severity of the subject matter .

positiveC,' director : melvin van peebles || screenplay : melvin van peebles || stars : melvin van peebles ( sweetback ) , simon chuckster ( beetle ) , hubert scales ( mu-mu ) , john dullaghan ( commissioner ) , rhetta hughes ( old girl friend ) , mario van peebles ( young sweetback ) , john amos ( motorcycle guy ) || mpaa rating : x melvin van peebles  " sweet sweetback s baadasssss song " was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement . it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident . its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before . in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , " sweet sweetback " was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter . van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built " sweet sweetback " from the ground up almost entirely by himself . because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself . the movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby . van peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film s responsibilities himself . he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role . he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck . for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases " rated x by an all-white jury , " which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film . he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling . the storyline in " sweet sweetback " is deceptively simple . it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they re bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder . however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously . acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death . the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico . although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles  camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked . van peebles  entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored . at the beginning of " sweet sweetback , " he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : " sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . " van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration . of course , with today s abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , " sweet sweetback " doesn t seem all that revolutionary . it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made . at that time , " sweet sweetback " was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it . distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles  words , gave the black audience " a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . " of course , once it caught on , it caught on big . " sweet sweetback " is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates " sweetback " from other movies like " shaft " ( 1972 ) and " the mack " ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios . " sweet sweetback " is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers . however , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , " sweet sweetback " is certainly not without its controversies . when it was first released , an article was published in " ebony " magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it . there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of . others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives . still others point to the cliché black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm . nevertheless , a movie like " sweet sweetback " cannot be made without conflicting points of view . it is a revolutionary movie not because it s about one man s defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before . until that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites . the fact that " sweet sweetback " was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply " the black community " ) . van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between " sweet sweetback " and all movies that had come before it . when the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman . near the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , " oh lord , let him die . don t let them kill him . let him die on his own . " it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn t even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape . and , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : " watch out ! a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . " beyond the political aspects , " sweet sweetback " is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be . he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time . he shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him . he makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images . the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment . watching " sweet sweetback " more than twenty-five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite . arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film . but there is more to the film than its racial aspect . the legacy of " sweet sweetback s baadasssss song " is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him .

" . the stakes keep raising ( much like in executive decision , an excellent action-thriller ) , and even though the audience knows how the film will end , it s a lot of fun getting there . i only have two minor complaints about the entire film . the first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence . while their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going ( which they do ) , i feel as though it could have been done much quicker , and less conventionally . i mean , did we really have to see the ship s crew at a wedding ? because of that , you now know exactly what s going to happen to the groom ! my other gripe would be during the film s finale . there s an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president s plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one . i cannot stress this enough . . . until a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect , stick with using models . yes , u-571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you " that couldn t happen " , but the overall point of this film is entertainment . it succeeds fantastically .

positiveC,' steven spielberg s " amistad , " which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who " owned " them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story . first , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery . second , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . last , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade . " amistad " succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements . i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another " anti-slavery " movie . having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn t already know about it . fortunately , i turned out to be wrong . for one thing , spielberg s camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders  operations in africa , so " amistad " was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning . and some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . one scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their " excess " slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year . spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating . the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time . exposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation . the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court . the biggest success of " amistad " is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court . through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles . " what kind of country is this , where laws  almost  work ? " he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court . spielberg s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque s angry outburst in the court room . still , there isn t enough of this for it to be a serious problem . the main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can t quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . this summer s contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . " amistad " tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . perhaps the best way to describe it is this : " amistad " is three four star films edited into one . almost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . however , i can t honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery .

[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture] do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you ve just become part of a story ? everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others  story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) . that seems to be the basic theory behind `go ,   where several characters  chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways . in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn t usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors . these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out . how they will all come together is the process the film deals with . i d imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators  testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general . the film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what s to come . we meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn t seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent . she s not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works . maybe this is because she s not a very afeminite character , but she s far from masculine - a creative character indeed . things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences . this agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug . the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death . nearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don t think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film s makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be . once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle . when the title screen `ronna  is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it s clear this film isn t going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling . considering how good it is up until that point , it s a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today . and so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn t exactly go as planned , but that s what keeps it all so interesting . the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna s story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead . simon and his three friends head to vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined . the third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna s story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle . we re shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna . and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren t even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were . i d really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven t seen the film . perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking .

" enemy of the state " is the same way : it s engrossing for its entire running time , and it s scary the way that it shows a man s decent into kafkaism , but it s too technical . it s too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be . it casts will smith , one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he s charming and witty and never uninteresting , and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person . i hate to do this , but last year s film " the game " got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened . the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling , but also the best mindfuck of the entire year . not that i want every kafkaesque film to be " the game " ( this year s " the spanish prisoner " succeeds with less thrills and chills ) , but it should be an example of what works and what doesn t . will smith s character is , frankly , too perfect , at least too movie perfect . he had an affair with another woman ( lisa bonet , ha ha ) , but his relationship with his wife ( regina king ) is basically fine regardless . he has a kid , and he s raking in money as a lawyer , albeit a very good and reasonably moral one . so he generally doesn t have any real problems as a human being , and is therefore boring . . . except that he is played by will smith , who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering " id4 " / " men in black " territory . he s a good dramatic actor ( just see the first half hour of " six degrees of separation " for proof of this , not that he isn t great the whole time ) , and here , he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character , which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities . smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance , extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world , under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control , when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party ( a nature observer played by , uh , jason lee ) . the government wants the disk , and is prepared to destroy his life to get it . as smith s plight is dramatized , we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him , sitting in vans disguised as other businesses , staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet . these guys ( played by jack black , jamie kennedy , and seth green ) are the most interesting part of this film because they re , well , fascinating : they re doing their jobs , which are evil , but the film doesn t view them as such , and they almost become our friends . we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn t automatically judge them as the villains . they re also scary because we get the idea that they re not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world . it s as if they re obsessed with their jobs , not because they re evil , but because , hey , it s a fun job , and no one else can do it like them . unfortunately , this also backfires a bit on the film : instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that " the game " was , you see everything , and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on . sure , you re chilled , but you re not exacty freaked out by what s going on . but what do you expect from tony scott , the man who never met a five-second piece of film he ever liked . he s a not-bad director because , hell , he is always interesting to watch ( if not occasionally moronic - exhibit a : " days of thunder " ) , but the reason he s not great is because he s too technical and calculated . his shots are perfectly executed , and leave nothing to the imagination , and they re always making sure you re paying attention . this is incredibly annoying , and it reduces " enemy of the state " to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths , but still manage to entertain without any real problems . despite never actually becoming great , it s never actually boring and it s always intriguing . watching the government set-up smith is endlessly fascinating , and since we care about smith s likeable protagonist , we are set-up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy-esque entertainment . add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) , and you ve got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith s plight without a minute s worth of boredom .

positiveC,' the trailer for this low budget , independently financed documentary made it appear as if american movie was a po-faced piss-take on the making of the blair witch project . but it is so much more . the brainchild of chris smith , american movie is a journey through the frustrations and anguish of the low budget film maker . it is enough to either inspire all young hopeful film makers that hope and naiveté can eventually triumph over adversity and inexperience , or else it will send them and their cameras packing fearing that the task of making a low budget film is almost impossible in today s climate . smith documents the trials and tribulations of mark borchardt , an aspiring young film maker from wisconsin , as he tries to get his masterpiece northwestern up and running . to raise the finance for his feature film though he first has to complete work on his short film coven and then sell 3000 units on video . american movie is an up-close and intimately personal portrait of borchardt s struggle , both financially and spiritually , to achieve his dream . this film was nearly three years in the making , as smith followed borchardt around , recording his frustrating efforts to complete his film without compromising his vision or artistic integrity . we follow borchardt through film festivals , trying to hype interest in his project , as well as his endeavours to cast and complete his short horror film . when the going gets tough , borchardt s relatives , including the unforgettable 82 year old uncle bill , come to the rescue , with funding and physical assistance . but the most amazing character we meet here is mike schank , who has provided the film s music as well as doubling as a production assistant . if anyone can come close to stealing a documentary then it is the intriguing schank , whose deadpan style and earnestness are unforced yet endearingly hilarious . the film also blurs the distinction between the film maker and his subjects , as smith and borchardt become friends off camera , adding yet another more intimate dimension to the documentary . so cleverly put together is this off beat film that , at times , it is hard to tell whether american movie is the genuine article or yet another of the increasing series of mock documentaries ( like bigger than tina , etc ) that have recently hit our screens . the background notes certainly make it appear real ! throughout the film smith displays a dry and very droll sense of humour , although not everyone will find the film particularly funny . american movie has an almost unstructured narrative style and many self indulgent passages that will probably appall as many as it pleases . american movie will not be to everyone s tastes . this is a film that you will either love or hate !

positiveC,' filled with a tantalizing air of suspense , with a friend like harry is an unusual yet well-balanced mix of dark comedy , french thriller , and surreal drama . as i was watching the film , i found myself groping for its message at each turn of the plot . its ultimate effect is comparable to claude chabrol s la cérémonie , which , with all its violence and commentary on class delineation . in with a friend like harry , two former schoolmates accidentally meet in a roadside bathroom . michel ( laurent lucas ) is on vacation with his wife claire ( mathilde seigner ) and their three little daughters . he is harried and haggard , far from enjoying this so-called vacation : an endless ride with whining and screaming kids in an un-air conditioned car . harry ( sergi lópez ) is everything michel is not : sleek and self-contained , he doesn t seem to be burdened by anything except good memories and a load of money . within minutes , harry invites himself and his girlfriend , a corpulent , springy bun named plum ( sophie guillemin ) , to michel s house -- to reminisce about the good old school days michel himself can barely remember . the success of harry is held in its odd combination of very real , down-to-earth elements combined with surreal devices , creating suspense , disbelief , and intrigue . the film plays skillfully with a common knowledge that there is always a potential danger in bringing an intruder into the family , no matter how stable this family is . at the table , harry recites michel s adolescent school poem with the unattractive title the dagger in the skin of plight , as well as an excerpt from a sci-fi novel called flying monkeys . leading a life of constant gratification , harry is convinced that all michel s problems -- lack of money and the desire to please other people -- have obscured michel s path toward fulfillment as a writer . quick and decisive , harry is a man of action , and his solutions are very concrete . it is nearly impossible to fathom the nature of harry s obsession with michel s early poem , which he remembers by heart . but , as the film progresses , it becomes obvious that harry expresses his obsession through crime . by the film s end , he is comparable to ripley from rene clement s purple noon ( and the american the talented mr . ripley ) , a sociopath with an insidious mind learning that he could get away with just about anything . however , harry is a hedonist and a misanthrope , but his enigma is never as refined as ripley s is . the film even treats him with a slight contempt : there is always something distasteful in harry s brisk arrogant walk , in his narrow unexpressive eyes . the music , with sinister ominous overtones , often diverts our attention by accentuating superfluous elements , such as the eggs harry likes to eat after having an orgasm or the vulgar pink wall pattern in the bathroom of michel s house . it creates a creepy and eerie effect , but , after a while , these devices become as predictable as harry s long list of solutions . the movie is not a weighty one , yet there is something in its tension and the way it feeds you its story that attracts you to it . the film seduces you into thinking that , at certain moments , you know where it s headed , and then you realize that you don t . acting is crucial to this film s success , and it is impeccable . michel and claire never get hysterical or grotesquely quarrelsome during their daily rituals . the core of their disorganized and turbulent family unit is established early in the film , and it s clear that no matter what sacrifices michel has had to make for his girls , he loves them without regret or resentment . there is an interesting comment , however , in the closing sequence of the film . just like at the beginning of the film , michel drives his family in the car , only now the car is a present from the magnanimous harry . in a splendid 4x4 sport utility vehicle , with air-conditioning full blast , the kids are content ; no more screaming , howling , or demands . michel smiles -- whatever price he has had to pay for getting rid of harry was well worth it . does the film suggest we all have a little of harry in us ? i think it does . whether it is a point worth making is another question altogether . aka harry , un ami qui vous veut du bien .

positiveC,' before even seeing a single frame of the film , it would be easy to snicker at deep impact , in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet . it is the latest entry in this decade s dubious revival of the  70s disaster film , and the first of two " the sky is falling " flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july s armageddon , in which a meteor is the threat ) . its tagline , " oceans rise . cities fall . hope survives " is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight ( " they came in alone . . . the only way out . . . is together " ) , but it s every bit as treacly . the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at . the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions , such as the usual opening " roll call , " in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced . the most prominent of the " personal " stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) , who is distraught that her father ( maximilian schell ) left her mother ( vanessa redgrave ) for a younger woman ( rya kihlstedt ) . what is just as snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration , microsoft and nbc s cable news network msnbc , which employs jenny , who is the film s ostensible main character . in the vision of america presented here , msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home , when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country . the initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante s peak , but there s one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder . she won an emmy for her helming work on nbc s smash er , which is essentially a weekly disaster movie , each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises . the challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold : ( 1 ) to make the audience care for these guest characters , regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are , and ( 2 ) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic . having passed the " er challenge " in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker , leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen . as the countdown to impact progresses , the ominous feeling of doom is palpable , leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension . there s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone , but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects . situations that initially feel contrived , such as jenny s familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) and comet discoverer leo biederman ( elijah wood ) , achieve some poignance ; and even the more vaguely drawn characters , including u . s . president tom beck ( morgan freeman ) , astronaut spurgeon " fish " tanner ( robert duvall ) , and his rather faceless crew ( ron eldard , jon favreau , mary mccormack , blair underwood , and alexander baluyev ) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft messiah , have their share of touching moments . the latter fact owes a debt to the actors , who all do a solid job and are well-cast , with the possible exception of leoni ; she delivers a decent performance , but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster . although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work ( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular ) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister , it is the first of the  90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact , even if it isn t as deep as hoped .

huddleston , gerard klein , et al . a warners release . 120 minutes . rated r . from its first shots , frantic generates and keeps up such terrific suspense that it makes most ( if not all ) other thrillers of the 80s taste like porridge . the suspense is deliberate , slow , stretched out in an utterly commonplace atmosphere --and it is exceptionally effective . san francisco doctor walker ( harrison ford ) arrives in paris , with his wife sondra ( betty buckley , ) for a medical convention , with a bit of tax-exempt sightseeing on the side and a second honeymoon away from the kids . they are exhausted by the long trip and jet-lag . on the " peripherique " -- the belt-road around paris-- their taxi has a flat . even this red herring happening carries suspense . they later totter into the grand hotel . the bleary-eyed couple of generic american tourists are dutifully determined to start their stay with croissants and a roll in bed . but bed and breakfast are not to be . while ford is showering noisily , with gleeful anticipation of things to come , the phone rings and his wife answers . when the man steps out of the shower , the lady has vanished . you  re made to feel all along that something ominous is going to happen , but since you don t know what this might be , every moment , object and tiny event is laden with suspense . director polanski has assimilated better than any other filmmaker the techniques of alfred hitchcock , where the most common thing could be uncommon , where the blandest face could become sinister , where the extraordinary lies within the ordinary . later , polanski also pays additional , discreet homage to the master in ways that hitchcockians will spot -- from the ironic use of the statue of liberty to a rooftop scene . but there s a difference in attitudes . hitchcock mocks gently both his principals and their entourage , while polanski practices a restrained irony only on the surrounding people and places . he is entirely serious about his protagonist harrison ford . tension mounts unrelentingly as ford goes from puzzlement to questions in the lobby , from fruitless inquiries on the spot to the police station , then to the us . embassy . finally he is forced to embark on his own , desperate , frantic search . every imaginable frustration stands in his way , and every stumbling- block is genuine and observed with sardonic precision --even black humor -- by the script and its execution . ford speaks no french and is at the mercy of the good will of interpreters . the hotel personnel is amiable but skeptical : wives have been known to fly the coop -- not a big deal in france . the familiar quirks and annoyances of daily life in paris add to the difficulties --like people on the phone who don t want to be disturbed and hang up . complicating ford s miseries are the peculiar , private and official gallic attitudes toward any problem . compounding this are their specific attitudes toward americans , whom they see as un-cartesian , unsophisticated simpletons . underlying that is the familiar , slightly sadistic pleasure ( which the entire planet shares ) in getting back at the yanks who have had it so good for so long . let the americans stew . the cops treat ford with haughty superiority . the american embassy people -- once the breathless ford has run through the gauntlet of security measures-- are cold , indifferent and unhelpful . the doctor is on his own , in a paris shown with superb calculation and naturalness , neither as gay paree nor as an artificially sinister metropolis . against all odds , ford --who ought to be distracted to perdition with worry -- somehow keeps his wits . taking his main clue from a wrong suitcase , the harassed , dead-tired husband doggedly follows it and becomes involved in a nightmarish investigation . it leads him to odd but very real places , and to fringe people . among them stands out a black-leather young woman , michelle ( emmanuelle seigner ) . she s sexy , with long legs that polanski s camera caresses with low-angle shots , but ford does not . the film is smart . it gives you some of the conventions of " film noir " but it does not get into all-out cliches . the girl  s erotic presence is palpable ( her dancing is like vertical copulation ) , but this is not used as a distraction or a love interest . keeping up mercilessly the suspense of the search is what matters . there does come a point where some filmic overkill sets in --and i mean this more figuratively than literally-- where , in plot twists and in persons introduced , too much is too much , especially by the standards of alfred hitchcock who would have built up developments more soberly while he would have kept going with character development . ( that s why i think of the construction of his pictures as " clean . " ) even so , the first part of frantic is masterly , the second part confident of itself , and the third , in spite of its gimmickry , still has some good touches . harrison ford , a true professional whose talent and versatility tend to be forgotten because of his han solo and indiana jones roles , confirms here the appeal of his unpretentiousness . newcomer emmanuelle seigner gets off to a pretty indecent start . she s the granddaughter of the legendary louis seigner , star of the comedie francaise . the supporting cast , especially the hotel and police people , are perfect in their realism : the more you know france the better those actors are . polanski chose them and directed them with impressive precision . roman polanski was born in paris in 1933 of polish-jewish parents who returned to poland three years later . soon after came the occupation by the nazis , the persecution of jews and the deportation of his family to death camps . roman , who had escaped the germans , survived . later he studied and made films in poland , became famous . a cosmopolitan who knew well big cities , he used them in his works with moody authenticity : london in repulsion , paris in the tenant , new york in rosemary s baby , los angeles in chinatown . the production values of frantic are outstanding . polanski surrounded himself with a who s who of collaborators . french scenarist ( and director ) gerard brach worked here with polanski for the ninth time . among his fifty-odd screenplays are the two of us ( " le vieil homme et l enfant " ) , quest for fire , the name of the rose , jean de florette , manon of the spring , maria s lovers . editor sam o steen had already three oscar nominations ( who s afraid of virginia woolf ? , chinatown , silkwood ) . designer pierre guffroy had won two oscars ( tess , the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie ) . composer ennio morricone is a legend in his field . director of photography sobocinski , a polish collaborator of andrzej wajda , proved again what an incredible source of great cinematographers poland is , especially the film school at lodz , polanski s alma mater . curiously , this is the second movie called " frantic , " at least in english . the first ( called in france elevator to the gallows ) was also a thriller , also made in france , also set in paris . it was one of the very first works of the french new wave , and the first fiction feature by louis malle , who , curiously , as in the case of polanski , was one of the few european filmmakers to be very successful with the pictures that they made in america . oddly , except for a small , faithful following , frantic has been underrated and paid little attention to from the time of its release on .

positiveC,' starring : keanu reeves , al pacino , charlize theron , craig t . nelson , connie nielson , and judith ivey if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it s their predictable endings . the devil s advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does . unfortunately for the devil s advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film . nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) . i don t think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan . well , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) . the devil s advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session . kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl . he ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) . he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury . he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife . after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . he graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . his life seems to be on the rise . and of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted . meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . he spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane . all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . after a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin s wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . a fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin s real father . is it all just a big nightmare ? or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin s life ? the devil s advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don t expect . is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? if so , the devil s advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . i went into the devil s advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn t like the ending ? ) . the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . the devil s advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all . if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . the film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . it was at this point that i felt cheated . taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . everything occurs from his perspective . he is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . i don t want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil s advocate is the extreme amount of everything . it earned its r rating for a reason . there is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . this film really isn t subtle about anything , showing us everything . it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh . however , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . i don t condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann s problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . this may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . she is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . something the devil s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . the story actually has something to say about humanity . in one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . then , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . this semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil s advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . when a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . the cast of the devil s advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don t expect . heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . he has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . i have never seen him more believable to date . al pacino is of course the scene stealer . his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . jeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller s day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin s past . connie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . one familiar face with a twist was " coach " star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . the devil s advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . at 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . for the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . the technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . but just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . personally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early . reviewed by respect ( respect@aros . net ) http : //www . aros . net/~respect/movies . html '

" their isolation on the island puts them into an unpleasant confrontation with some modern day pirates . they also deal with the conflict of each other s opposite tendencies , the humourous pratfalls of inexperience in their situation and the unexpected situations in nature . i couldn t quite get my mind around the fact that i was watching some scenes straight out of movies such as  butch cassidy and the sundance kid  ,  romancing the stone  and others and while pleasant enough in content , the movie is a one time deal you want want to re-visit and while ford isn t quite upstaged by his female companion , heche is still more believable in her role and gives a better performance . i was surprised .

positiveC,' gattaca ( 1997 ) rated pg-13 for brief violent images , language , some sexuality , and nudity  starring : ethan hawke , uma thurman , loren dean , jude law , alan arkin , tony shalhoub , gore vidal , and xander berkeley with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general . hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story . . . and good characters . . . and good acting , etc ( contact being the exception ) . and for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth . the closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created . now comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet . the difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening . most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering . using this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills . unfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office . since seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca . lately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca . most people don t even realize that it is a film . despite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it . niccol s film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic . gattaca begins in the 21st century . procreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it . natural child birth is considered old-fashioned . we are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program . one of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman . the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman . vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love . however , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99% chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span . as a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics . anton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns . vincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company . labeled an " in-valid , " vincent s dream seems impossible , until he meets a black-market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub ) . german introduces him to a " valid " who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident . jerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc . ) that he will need to get past gattaca s tight security . in exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship . after the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent s eyelashes left at the scene of the crime . irene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed " valid " working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome . gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time . only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them . unfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects-laden films , it normally gets buried . the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs . the orange glow of gattaca s scenes are impressive , but the sets deserve most of the credit . the sets are very well done , creating a futuristic sense , but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers . as we look at the designs , we realize that these buildings aren t too far into the future . this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day . the best thing , however , is the plot . the story is more than your average sci-fi/thriller . at its heart , it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present . perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring . would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ? maybe human nature is a result of mankind s flaws . if we get rid of flaws , do we get rid of dreams as well ? niccol s intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well , and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story , or vice versa . the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters . while flat may sound like a poor job on niccol s part , it actually enhances the meaning behind the story . ethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor , giving his best performance of his lifetime so far . his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and " valid " peers . uma thurman is . . . well , uma thurman . her character is slightly underdeveloped , but the story isn t about her . however , thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character . jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character . he provides several nice touches , and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one . loren dean gives a nice performance in his well-developed character . dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie . alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank . still , he does a good job . gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles , and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film . gattaca is rated pg-13 for brief violent images , language , some sexuality , and nudity . despite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film , i wasn t exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty . it turned me off slightly , but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have . if this had been a typical hollywood film , it would have ended much differently . however , with all the mindless science fiction films out there , it is nice to have a film which doesn t talk down to its audience ( i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding : g , t , c , and a ) . instead , it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want : a science fiction film with morals behind it . whatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining ? hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca . . . and hopefully audiences will too . p . s . personal note to p . j . gladnick : how dare you call this film the worst film of the year . i can t even begin to image what film you do like . that frightens me beyond anything . reviewed by respect ( pun intended ) - respect@aros . net http : //www . aros . net/~respect/movies . html '
positiveC,' 1998 , r , 100 minutes [1 hour , 40 minutes] starring : ben stiller ( jerry ) , amy brenneman ( mary ) , aaron eckhart ( barry ) , catherine keener ( terri ) ; produced by steve golin , jason patric ; written and directed by neil labute . seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p . m . at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic s pass . [theater rating :  : okay seats , sound , and picture] modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes . the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it . " your friends and neighbors " takes a different approach as it s a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends . one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute s basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras . everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . labute s ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what s specifically impressive is the fact the characters  names are never revealed until the end credits roll . for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . we re always able to tell where the characters are ( someone s home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . the film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater . no one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . we re simply dropped in on the characters  lives and are expected to figure out the rest . the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they re only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . first there s barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don t know what they re problem is . barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn t have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn t hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . labute s script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors  good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . it s natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it s fascinating . two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . cary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word " bastard . " somehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way . he s the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he s secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him . patric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . she s a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others  action , as that s the hook of the film . the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each s scenarios , but it s often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . the result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character s guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . since the characters only interact with each other there isn t much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . are we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? i don t know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . but what this film does have that the others don t is repercussions in the end . although the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren t immortal . in what way " your friends and neighbors " is supposed to work is open to interpretation . it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . still , it s an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective . please visit chad z movie page at : http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz - over 200 new and old films reviewed in depth , not just blind ratings and quick capsules .

positiveC,' how many of us would become strippers ? for those of us who wouldn t , is it a moral reason , or purely a lack of confidence ? that s probably not a fair question , and for a lot of us , it could very well be for neither of those reasons . as you watch the full monty , however , you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions . would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough ? in case you haven t guessed , the full monty is about stripping , but striptease it ain t . it s actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication . it is the story of six out-of-work , out-of-shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless , but not without need . what to do ? it hits our main character gaz ( robert carlyle ) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis . it seems that simple : take it off and bring in the cash . eventually , gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance . these include the overweight , confidence-lacking dave ( mark addy ) , the uptight , overly-officious gerald ( tom wilkinson ) , the once suicidal lomper ( steve huison ) , and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition : horse ( paul barber ) , an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy , and guy ( hugo speer ) , a young well-endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant . when the sextet is complete , we re given a hefty dose of physical comedy . we watch the bumbling middle-aged men choreograph pseudo-sexy dance numbers , all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place . as if there anti-appeal wasn t enough , they decide to boost interest in the group by promising " the full monty " on opening night , which for us americans , means baring it all . . . and i mean * all * . the movie actually ends on opening night ; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add . it s sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater . with the subject matter , you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel-good , almost inspiring film , but it surprisingly turns out that way . the amount of light , touching drama also comes as a nice surprise , never feeling off-balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film . there s a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words , and the ensemble cast couldn t be better . each character is completely individual , interesting , funny , and most importantly , real . the full monty is never offensive , a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone could ve easily fallen prey to tastelessness . it s one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment , perfect for a great night on the town , or as a saturday night movie rental . either way you see it , it shouldn t let you down in the slightest . and , pun heavily intended , when it s all said and done , you ll be smiling from cheek to cheek .

positiveC,' the fifth element : a film review by jesse a . kaplan cast : bruce willis , gary oldman , milla jovivovich , chris tucker , ian holm , luke perry directed by luc besson wow ! when i orginally found out about the fifth element ( t5e ) i was amazed by not only the plot , the effects , the sets , and the casts , but just how what an incredibly different movie it was going to be . well now its out all over and has gotten some mixed reviews . let me tell you something ladies and gentlemen , this movie is terrific . all the future will be lost unless the fifth element is found . i don t even know how to explain the movie so i won t . let me say this then . if you like action , sci-fi , great costumes , an amazingly hott up and coming actress , shoot  em up , futuristic ride of your life the t5e is the movie for you this summer . bruce willis ( die hard , pulp fiction ) is at his best as an ex-marine turned taxi who has to save the world from annialation from the unltimate evil . evil is helped by the crooked arms dealer billioniare zorg , played by gary oldman ( the professional , air force one ) . leeloo , as the fifth element , the surprime being must be used correctly to defeat this evil with help from a struggling to save priest , holm , and his assistant . once the action moves to the space resort we are met be d . j . ruby rodd , chris tucker ( friday ) who is a great cross between prince , dennis rodman , and orpah whinfrey . the sets and costumes and the best part of the movie and the $90 million dolllar budget certainly isn t wasnted at all in this movie . definately one of the true hits of this summer . although compared to sci-fi thrillers such as stargate and blade runner , t5e works because its not deep at all . simply great mindless fun , guarenteed to make your $7 . 50 worthwhile . the fifth element runs 2 : 07 and is worth every minute . it is rated pg-13 for brief female nudity , cartoonish violence , and a little profanity . a definate winner ,  .

positiveC,' year : 2000 . starring the voices of julia sawalha , mel gibson , miranda richardson , jane horrocks , imelda staunton , tony haygarth , benjamin whitrow . written by peter lord & nick park ( story ) and karey kirkpatrick ( screenplay ) . directed by peter lord and nick park . rated g . i know that " funnest " isn t a word . " fun " is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . but that s the word that came to me right after viewing " chicken run . " no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like " that was the funnest movie i ve ever seen ! " so to hell with webster s -- " chicken run " is one of the funnest movies i ve seen in a while . i can t remember the last time i ve seen anything funner . the chickens at tweedy s farm are up to something . living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm s egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , " chickens go in ; pies come out . " what sort of pies ? chicken pies , of course . co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : " creature comforts , " " the wrong trousers , " and " a close shave . " the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . part of what made the " wallace " films brilliantly entertaining was park s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . " the wrong trousers , " for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and " a close shave " owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in " chicken run . " the plot is largely lifted from " the great escape " ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . thing is , the film doesn t feel like it s been lifted from somewhere else ; " chicken run " feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? park and lord milk the incongruity for all it s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . but they re * chickens * , so it s funny to us . another thing that helps " chicken run " ( and most of park s films ) succeed is the animators  subtle way of giving nods to the very films they re cribbing . there are references to " the great escape , " obviously , and " stalag 17 . " the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both " raiders of the lost ark " and " indiana jones and the temple of doom . " there s even a nod to " the blues brothers , " if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson s nationality and film history . the " braveheart " reference is a hoot if you catch it . when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , " chicken run " is downright brilliant in its execution . consider this : since july of last year , i ve seen dozens upon dozens of " blair witch project " parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . why ? because once you got past the thought that " they re parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch  movie , " most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . conversely , " chicken run " doesn t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . if you ve never seen " indiana jones , " the chase sequence is still fun . even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it s understood , and as a result , " chicken run " is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . enjoyment of this movie doesn t require knowledge of film history , but if you ve got it , " chicken run " is that much richer . the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on " absolutely fabulous " ) nails it . she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . the characters  inevitable romance doesn t feel contrived , but sweet . poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn t any help . jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . they even come up with an inspired riff on something that s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of " chicken run , " it comes as a delightful surprise . the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . the animation is first-rate . remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable " chicken run " really is . this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios  animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . as in such top-notch family fare as " a bug s life " or " toy story 2 , " " chicken run " has something to offer in nearly every frame . certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the details . anyway , the movie s just a boatload of fun . funnest damn movie i ve seen all year .

positiveC,' being released on the same weekend as five other new movies the iron giant is and will become one of the best films you are not likely to see . it s a shame that such a critically acclaimed movie can t do well at the box office , but the public likes it s mainstream trash . hogarth hughes is an adventurous young boy living in rockwell , a cozy seaside town in maine . it s 1957 and sputnik has just been sent into orbit by the russians , so when a crazed drunk is out on his boat and sees what he calls a metal monster the townspeople joke around with him at first . when cars start getting eaten , and power lines destroyed , the people begin to wonder . when kent mansley ( a government agent ) comes to investigate he discovers hogarth s fake gun near the power plant and questions him about it , he says he doesn t know anything but mansley figures he knows more than he s letting on . the truth is , hogarth is hiding the robot at the local scrapyard where dean mccoppin , the owner , is keeping him hidden in a shed . he s beginning to form a bond with the metal man and doesn t want to see him hurt . when kent discovers that there is a robot , he is scared it s from another country and is going to annihilate us all , and he sends for reinforcements . while bearing the strong resemblance to e . t . , the film is still in a class of it s own . finally , an animated film with no songs , no fake love stories , and no stupid sidekicks . instead this is a wonderful film with a good message , ( putting in the fact that guns actually kill people is a great message for a children s film ) plus the film is filled with lots of gags and jokes aimed directly at adults too . the film has received horrible box office earnings , and is likely to be put with other critically loved comedies such as rushmore , election , go , and dick . this is a magical film that can be viewed again and again . so what are you waiting for ? go out and see this film now ! don t delay , call moviephone and get tickets for the iron giant , which gets  stars .

positiveC,' member of the  internet movie critic s association  http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/studio/5713/index . html  the newton boys  does something clever . it draws you in slowly after a more than mediocre beginning and eventually has you rooting for a group of wild west american outlaws who never killed anyone in their rampage of robbing somewhere in the neighbourhood of 200 banks between 1919 and 1924 . using a robin hood mentality of robbing from the rich to pay the poor ( in this case , however , they pay themselves ) , matthew mcconaughey ( willis newton ) ethan hawke ( jess newton ) skeet ulrich ( joe newton ) , and vincent d onofrio ( dock newton ) are featured as the four brothers who are loyal to each other and to their profession . dwight yoakam is an explosives expert who hooks up with the brothers and his specialty is using a nitro mix in blowing safes . rounding out the leading players is julianna margulies who plays louise , a cigar store clerk who becomes willis  girlfriend . as the brothers plot each robbery , there is a hint of detail reminiscent of a documentary style approach by director richard linklater (  dazed and confused  ,  before sunrise  ) and the visual style the film projects is very impressive and candidly entertaining . matthew mcconaughey is a charismatic leading man and he is truly one of this generation s most under rated actors and has a power capable of carrying an entire film on his back . his portrayal of willis newton , a man raised dirt poor who had a tough life and claims to have went to prison as an innocent man , is someone many people can generate sympathy for and these factors fuel his desire to rob banks as we see him at the start of the film as an ex-con as someone asks him : " how was prison ? " , to which he replies : " how was the war ? " despite the unusual place in history the newton brothers have found , they remain virtually unknown compared to the likes of john dillinger , bonnie and clyde and " baby face " nelson . perhaps because the newton brothers weren t as cold blooded as their criminal peers and not just the american but the human fascination with violence is something that propels the most violent criminals to the top of the list in terms of historical documentation . it s a constant pleasure to watch the creators of film pick up on a part of history that is relatively unknown because the research proves to be more difficult and when you succeed , it is a greater testament to your endeavour as a creative artist . everything is meticulously crafted in  the newton  boys  . from the clothes , to the sets , to the music , even the dialogue and wild west attitude are nailed down as impressively as any i ve ever seen . the most interesting footage of the film comes in two places . first is a trip to canada where they try and rob banks in ottawa and toronto and find canadian safes better built and harder to crack so they decide to rob banks in broad daylight on the street as they witness bank employees , in a more civilized and less dangerous society , openly carry large bags of cash on the streets for transfer and delivery and as the boys hold them up , they do what they can to get away without killing anyone in the process . secondly is the film s closing credits which are accompanied by footage of the johnny carson show where the real willis newton is interviewed by carson and we see the real joe newton in clips of home movies and they tell how the brothers always viewed banks and insurance companies as cheats themselves and that his gang was just one thief robbing from another . not a great justification of their profession , and while some may criticize the film as a glorification of bank robberies , it s captivating simplicity and depth of academic focus make it entertaining as an alternative form of social commentary and the film does something rare . it only uses violence when necessary to make its intended points .

positiveC,' with his sophomore effort , she s the one , edward burns has made another movie about irish catholic brothers that do stupid things to the women they love . like his first film , the brothers mcmullen , this story is set in and around new york city , and stars mike mcglone and burns himself as the aforementioned brothers ( only two this time ) . also in the mix once again is maxine bahns , burn s real-life love interest , who again stars as burns s . . . love interest . this time around , burns once again plays slacker to mcglone s uptight business-oriented younger brother . burns s mickey , a contented laid-back cab driver , falls in love ( with bahns ) and gets married on 24 hours notice . this is ridiculed by his brother francis ( mcglone ) , who is experiencing relationship problems of his own in the form of a deep-rooted affair that threatens to break up his marriage . the two brothers  problems are linked together by the fact that francis s young mistress , played by cameron diaz , is mickey s ex-fiancee . after establishing these relationship problems and throwing in the love quarrels that burns s father ( " frasier "  s john mahoney ) is having with their mother , burns allows them to unfold in much the same fashion that similar events unfolded in burns s first film . first , the brothers talk about their relationships ; in the next scene one of the brothers does something impetuous or stupid ; as a result , in a subsequent scene , the brothers have to talk about how * that * affected their relationships . all of this makes for a lot of repetition ( the story about why burns broke up with diaz is brought up at least eight times ) , and inevitably leads to the point where one of the brothers  wives or girlfriends does something independently impetuous , stupid , or long overdue , at which point , the brothers are forced to talk about * that * and maybe get into a fight . as the movie approaches its inevitable end , though , both brothers are forced to scramble and try to make everything work out . despite its strong similarities to burns s first film , she s the one reveals that burns has obviously done some growing since then . on the whole , this narrative is much more complex than that of the brothers mcmullen . unlike his first film , the problems of the brothers are interlinked such that their inevitable brotherly dialogues always hold some sort of interest for both brothers . burns also displays at one point that his characters do not all have to be completely tactless . this is demonstrated in what is by far the film s most powerful and original scene , a climactic moment between burns and diaz in which burns the director displays a newfound ability to reveal emotion without words . unfortunately , this is only one brief glimpse of complexity and true movie magic in a film that for the most part rehashes the brothers mcmullen .

positiveC,' i don t know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it s something i used to wonder about when i was younger . i can t decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i m pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought . the truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public . since birth , he s been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla . , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign . all the people in truman burbank s life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras . people watch truman s life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions . revenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman s friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones . the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else . even if you haven t seen the truman show , you ve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes . if anything i ve written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news . either way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you ll probably think it sucks . it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial " eat me " scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney ) . but weird things start happening . a stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father . we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm . the death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island . similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman s best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he s not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he d ever do is hurt him . as truman s trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else . there s even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman s existence . the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions . and it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on . he s come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura . most fundamentally , it s just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person s life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors . the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this . sure , the most interesting tv genre of the  90s has been reality programming and jerry springer s popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves . and when news shows use hidden cameras , it s done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment . but merge the two and you ve got the truman show . right now , it s implausible -- i mean , the fcc won t let you say the s-word on the air ; do you think they d let you broadcast every detail of a man s life to the entire world without his consent ? one day , though , it could happen . and , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up . you know they would . visit the movie critic at large homepage at http : //www . missouri . edu/~c667778/movies . html close to 1 , 000 reviews with a comedic flair . . .

positiveC,' desperate measures ( 1998 ) reviewed by chuck dowling copyright 1998 - the jacksonville film journal url : http : //users . southeast . net/~chuckd21/ " desperate measures " was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer  97 . for some reason , it was delayed until hollywood s traditional dumping ground : january . now that it s out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it s a simple yet highly entertaining film . michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who s bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) . keaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape . he succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies . the police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son . the film definately has it s flaws . the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status . also , after keaton s escape , garcia s captain barks at him " how many men have to die to save your kid s life ? " which the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark . the thing is , it s a vaild point . how many people have to be needlessly crippled , burned , and killed just to save this one child ? what s the greater good here ? many lives or one life ? if movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia s character . place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else . alas , movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience s strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable . despite a few silly moments ( and one or two really stupid ones ) , the good things about " desperate measures " outnumber the bad . the main highlight would be keaton s performance . the character could have easily been an overacting , scene chewing freak , but keaton underplays it nicely . he s not as menacing as he was in " pacific heights " or even as menacing as he was in " batman " ( yes kids , batman used to be a dark character ) , but you certainly get the idea that he s evil . even the final scene of the film , which normally i would just hate , seems strangely appropriate for this film . so much so that i didn t mind it in the slightest . and another bonus : the film takes place in san francisco , which usually means a car chase on those hills that you ve seen a billion times before . and for a moment , it looked as though it was about to happen . but it doesn t , and that s creative .

positiveC,' the rich man s wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double , where the story and characters are so one-dimensional and contrived that you know you shouldn t be enjoying yourself . but somehow , the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things . not that it s bad , it s just that it s been done before ; and better , in my opinion . i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre , but it s probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now ; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet , striving helplessly to get out , and instead of just flushing him , you end up kind of rooting for the little guy ? that s basically how i felt about this movie . i mean , it s not very good , but it s not completely bad either . the wife of the title is josie potenza ( played nicely by halle berry ) . she is married to tony ( christopher mcdonald . . . you know , the guy who looks like joe piscapo ) , a really stressed-out businessman who drinks way to much and doesn t give josie the attention she deserves ( * cough , cough * ) . thus , she is driven into the arms of another man , jake golden ( clive owen ) . near the beginning of the film , josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods . once there , however , tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details ( i m still not quite sure what line of work he s in ) . making the best of her situation , josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars . one night , she meets a stranger named cole ( peter greene , finally getting a meaty role ) . they have dinner together , and eventually , both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal . after learning that she is not happily married , cole offers to " take care " of the problem . managing to escape from the psychotic maniac , josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband . but then one night , cole shows up . . . and here is where the fun begins . from this point on , it s going to be a no-holds- barred cliche-fest , ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects . this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out . and for the most part , they re right ; the rich man s wife has nary one original bone in it s body . but who cares ? if you re looking for good ol  dumb suspense movie , you can t do much better than this . and if you suspense buffs aren t already sold , it has a killer of an ending too .

" rounders "   success , then , is owed to its proficient cast and intriguing portrayal of a world not many viewers will be familiar with . the dialogue may be filled with terms that only true players will grasp , but you don t have to speak the language to understand the words - a statement that pretty much sums up the effectiveness of the whole show . matt damon , fresh off his " good will hunting " hot streak , is perfect for the role of mike mcdermott , a young law student with a tremendous gift for gambling . but after losing all of his tuition money in a killer high-stakes match with russian poker aficionado teddy kgb ( john malkovich , deliciously hammy ) , he shifts his focus to scholarly matters , leaving his true area of expertise far , far behind . things change , however , when mike s old buddy worm ( edward norton ) re-enters his life - it seems worm , just out of jail , owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs , and is counting on his friend s superlative skills to help him pay off the debt . that " rounders "   story quickly molds itself into a conventional , predictable tale of redemption doesn t hinder its potency . director john dahl , infamous for his neo-noirs " red rock west " and " the last seduction , " gets extremely convincing mileage out of the been-there , done-that plot mechanics by trumping up the relationship between mike and worm . damon and norton bring so much to their roles that they d be worth catching even if " rounders " ultimately folded , but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning . any sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an unarguable highlight . if only the other character interaction was as successful , " rounders " might merit consideration when it comes time to number the year s best films . current " it girl " gretchen mol is sweetly appealing as mike s girlfriend jo , aware and weary of his seedy past , but her scenes with damon number too few to be very effective . john turturro s aging mentor and famke janssen s tempting siren , both interesting sketches , are hampered by the same limited screen time . and as a wizened judge , the great martin landau makes memorable a role that s mostly a plot device - he s on hand mostly to sort-of save the day and provide a voice for " rounders "   moral . that moral , by the way , is " our destiny chooses us , " and it s something of a surprise when " rounders " supports this solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect ; mike does learn from his mistake , but neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially appears to be . in the end , " rounders " sees gambling as less a mere addiction than a potential art form , but the poker itself is only a metaphor for a much larger picture . the road to true fulfillment lies within the realization and exercising of your natural passions , the movie espouses , no matter what they might be . here , low-rent lowlifes like worm just aren t cut out for the cards . screenwriters david levien and brian koppelman entertain and educate in their quest to vividly render a culture that s often generalized by movies ; even complete poker neophytes should cross the line from observers to participants when the movie gets to its concluding game scene . inside every adventurous filmgoer , there is a desire to be taken someplace new and exciting , and that s the precise allure of " rounders . " it ultimately matters not that a few of our tour guides feel partially-realized or that the journey itself is cluttered with sites we ve seen before , because the final destination is a satisfying one . in the end , " rounders " holds a winning hand . © 1998 jamie peck e-mail : jpeck1@gl . umbc . edu visit the reel deal online : http : //www . gl . umbc . edu/~jpeck1/ " like so many horror films , this one is set on a national holiday - the fourth of july . christmas and graduation day are also popular , although thanksgiving now seems reserved for movies about dysfunctional families .

positiveC,' american pie  -a review by bill chambers ( pie@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring jason biggs , thomas ian nicholas , chris klein , tara reid screenplay by adam herz directed by paul weitz american pie acknowledges a cold , hard fact that most movies don t : it is very difficult to get laid . its four virgin heroes are jim ( biggs ) , a chronic masturbator , kev ( nicholas ) , who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend ( reid ) , oz ( klein ) , a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning , and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) , a germphobe ( his crass nickname is hilarious , but i won t spoil it here ) who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member . jim , kev , oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women it s no wonder they re horny all the time . after a party at their studly friend stifler s ( seann william scott , in the film s sharpest performance ) house leaves them sexually unsatisfied , the quartet make a pact : to " lose it " by graduation-specifically , prom night , which is only a few weeks away . american pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds . almost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin  whoopee . all women are there to be ogled . ( alyson hannigan s perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch . ) situations abound that defy logic only to arouse and/or amuse its core audience , adolescent boys . ( to arouse : nadia s ( shannon elizabeth ) internet striptease-an unexpectedly raucous ( and guiltily pleasurable ) sequence . to amuse : jim s lusty encounter with a hot apple pie . ) what differentiates american pie from those dirty eighties comedies , aside from a very nineties obsession with bodily fluids * , is a cast that s light years more appealing than that of , say , just one of the guys . two more standouts : klein and " sctv "  s eugene levy . klein plays a kind-hearted athlete for the second time in a row , after alexander payne s underappreciated election . i hope to see more of this warm actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon . levy s is the most crowd-pleasing performance , and indeed , it s nice to see him back on the big screen in a role that makes wonderful use of that expressive brow . american pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents _would_ let you watch growing up . it skillfully employs a broad mix of pop tunes , much like john hughes  movies did , and even pays homage to the breakfast club a couple of times , most evidently when the prom band covers simple minds  " don t you ( forget about me ) . " the picture ultimately has a healthy , if obligatory , attitude towards safe sex-even at their most libidinous , american pie s protagonists first whip out a condom . the filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch is possible . for its familiarity and for its charming leads , i recommend american pie , but the buzz on this film had me expecting something . . . fresher . as far as the new teen cinema goes , it s at the top of the heap . * don t say i didn t warn you about the party scene .

positiveC,' all those who were offended by there s something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch . and while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end . american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season . i must question the studio that releases a movie like this . the producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film . some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie . american pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r . but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park . it is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny . american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night . jim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead . jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . . .   . of course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner . there are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief . american pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it . i loved the young cast in this movie . consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances . biggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise . but in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television s sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim s uneasy father . scenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie . after levy discovers jim s new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . but i never used baked goods .   it is performances such as his , and bill murray s in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out . there are some less-than-original aspects of the film . a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we ve seen before . if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother s dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect . secondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing . but at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it s own , biggs asks his buddies why he s going through so much pressure for something that s `not very important anyway .   and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature . in it s own way .

positiveC,' based on the boris karloff s classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive . recap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy . problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . . walking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good . the visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all . they pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi . the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) . unfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres . on one hand , it is a fast paced action film . on the other , it s a frightening horror film . and on the side , it s a hilarious comedy . ideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) . the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner . if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep s entombment , that would be impossible . and then there s the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies . while really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy . replace the sword with a chainsaw and you d effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness . while entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place . but at least it s a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of . on the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience . but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn the sound down ! while a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you re not careful ) . when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , " end of days " , it was so loud i couldn t make anything out .

" neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters ( the junkie , the fetishist , the artist , the frenchman , etc . ) , but isn t quite sure how to handle " sam deed " when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm , his elaborately constructed fake identity , his pathological fear of dogs , his ability to speak five different languages , and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on time s alternate realities . ( don t ask . ) it s all a bit much to take in . ruby s close friend gretchen ( cuz ya can t have a love story without the token friend , though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth ) chalks it up as a sexy role-playing game , but her cautious therapist ( holland taylor ) warns her that co-dependency is rearing its ugly head again and she s in over her head with yet another doomed relationship . who ya gonna believe ? despite her winning an academy award , marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence , one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents . her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear " cute " to her adoring fans . being loud and flashing a ( disingenuous ) smile does not necessarily equal " substantial and sexy . " it takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality . then there s that damned voice , which strains to be oh-so-adorable . look , this stuff is purely subjective . some people feel this way about richard gere , others cannot bear to watch robin williams  hyperactive schtick . for my money , it s m . tomei with a bullet . happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys ( or , more appropriately , chris marker s la jetee , especially with those still framed " memory " photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout ) . modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly , vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logan s run . as the stranger in a strange land , d onofrio walks slightly out-of-step , wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment . this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion ( though it often falls into the sci-fi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition -- we want deeds , not words ! ) at least twenty minutes too long , happy accidents eventually gets around to a race-against-time scenario that puts " sam deed " to the ultimate test . no movie can live in ambiguity forever , but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives . ( let s pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened , shall we ? ) there are also some slow , repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not he s crazy . the premise is strong enough to sustain interest , but it s enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in half-hour time slots , commercials included .

" besieged " is a cold film , but an engrossing one . bertolucci s attention to detail creates a vivid motion picture . but as i left the theatre , i couldn t help but want to know more about each character s background . shandurai s dark past is barely hinted at , and mr . kinsky has no story at all . there is such a serious drought of dialogue in this film , that i m sure quentin tarantino could have made this entire screenplay into a 5 minute film . but bernardo bertolucci s swift hand and fabio cianchetti s lucid camerawork keep " besieged " real . the very special thing about this movie is that i m sure 10 people could walk out of it with entirely different opinions of each aspect . if you like films that are unabashedly artsy , then " besieged " was made just for you . a review by akiva gottlieb , the teenage movie critic akiva@excite . com http : //www . angelfire . com/mo/film get your free , private email at http : //mail . excite . com/ '

the plot , as in most of them , is pure balderdash , but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it . instead of just plain billionaire psychotics , we get a rupert murdoch-esque media mogul/psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce , looking bitching with a white-haired cru cut , and always talking like he s out of breath ) , who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war . no , this is not " wag the dog " - he wants a real war , between china and england , and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it . . . in comes bond . james is sent all around the world , trying to do research on carver , fighting with his men , and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh , asian action star extraordinaire . . . and co-star of " supercop , " nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one ) . the two eventually , and predictably of course , begin working together , and yes , there is some sexual tension between the two . luckily , their relationship is never strained , and she never gives into his cassanova-ness until the finale . thank god again . in every bond film , james bags , on average , three women ( sometimes more , sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids-cautionary dalton ) , and he doesn t spoil this one ( though we never see them , of course - i mean , they need to stay around a pg-13 rating ) . there s always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again , the big bond girl ( yeoh ) , and this time we have an almost-cameo by teri hatcher as carver s wife , paris , who , it seems , was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning . yes , teri s very attractive , but she seems kind of dull . of course , it s not really her fault ; her part is under-written , and she s only in a small part of it . oh well . and there are always the big henchmen , the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains . this time we get a tall , arian-looking ( not to mention robert shaw in " from russia with love " -looking ) guy named stamper ( goetz otto ) , who is pretty awesome , although a bit stiff ( well , mostly his posture , really ) . and for a bit of comedy , we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point . the government people have small parts , as usual , with q ( desmond llewelyn , looking near death , sadly ) getting only one scene ( in a more grouchy mood than usual ) , and m ( judi dench ) , getting more than m usually gets ( i mean , it is judi dench ) . and for no reason whatsoever , except  cause he was so good in " goldeneye , " joe don baker shows up again as wade , admitting he has no reason for being there , and is this time more annoying . again , oh well . the action sequences are not a let-down , although sometimes go on too long . they pop up every now and then , mainly because they have to ( for the sake of the series ) , and some significant ones are the opening one , one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control , and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle , nonetheless ) through china streets ( or was it vietnam . . . the plot s not really essential ) . they re more high-tech , and feature much more laughs , which , yeah , i dig . so what if they re distracting ; they re supposed to be ! the acting , from most around is great . yeoh is , actually , one of the better bond girls , mainly because she s so unique . the better bond girls are more independent , and have a certain wily-ness to them . pussy galore , with her homoerotic undertones and all , is one of the best , and diana rigg , who married bond at the end of " on her majesty s secret service " only to be killed , added some emotional depth . yeoh is notable since she s so active , and has great chemistry with brosnan . pryce is an awesome villain , being slimy and lovable at the same time . and brosnan is , once again , the mack daddy . the bond series is built on cliches , mainly because they re so fun and add to the escapism . if you can remember the dalton years , and they re serious direction , you remember how unsuccessful they were , both financially and aesthetically . the series would falter if bogged down with too much plot , too many themes , and too much characterization . i don t really understand it myself , yet i m one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states . having seen all of them more than once ( yes , i ve seen this twice already ) , you can tell i adore them . while it s not one of the best , like " goldfinger " or " from russia with love , " " tomorrow never dies " is nonetheless a truly awesome installment , even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones .

[theater rating :  : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] " rounders " is exactly the kind of movie parents don t want their kids to see . it s not that it s a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it s a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . and to take make things " worse " it proves this through its original , fascinating story . there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the " noir " mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . this film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . matt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . damon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . mike s about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . but then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . he never sounds like he s reading from a script , nor that he s trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys  faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . immediately we get the sense that poker isn t for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . the game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . we learn only a little about mike , both past and present . presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . they go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike s childhood pal and fellow rounder " worm " ( norton ) is released from prison . it s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . technically , the plot isn t unlike many children s sitcoms in which the " good " kid s " bad " friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he s dealt and works with them . sometimes they pay off ( i . e . his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don t ( i . e . the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) . once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites  mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything s a battle against the cards destiny deals . one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . matt s good at gambling but he s also got potential to be a great lawyer . he could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there s stability but not much risk involved . can someone who s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? if the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test . everything is told from mike s perspective , but we re finally able to recognize some things on our own . this makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that . it works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . what separates " rounders " from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end . please visit chad z movie page at : http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz - over 200 new and old films reviewed in depth , not just blind ratings and quick capsules .

positiveC,' directed by jim abrahams , david zucker , and jerry zucker running time : 88 minutes originally released : 1980 airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film-making . after all , it s brought to us by one of the best known satire writing/directing teams . even if most people don t recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few . but although the zucker/abrahams/zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane ! remains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts . in the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high . films like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits . there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade . and so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film . this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean . . . it had to do with bad fish . airplane ! is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex-fighter-pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades . unable to stop living in the past , ted s world fell apart . he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty ) . in a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working . unfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self-pity . in the midst of it all , something happens . someone gets sick . then another . then another . soon , the whole plane is full of deathly-ill chicago-bound people . . . and when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul-jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ? ( gee , i wonder ) of course the main draw here is the non-stop " whiz-bang " comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags . although i had seen this movie a few times before , i was still laughing thru the entire thing . the most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen . he s a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight-faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film . in a film like this , you re not really expecting an elaborate production , so one can t complain about the amateurish quality . what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker . this character is pointless , nauseating , and very unfunny . i don t know why he was put in there , and i don t think anybody will find a good excuse . and when the film nears an end , it slows down quite a bit , almost getting old . you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long . aside from that , airplane ! is really a top-notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic . it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends , especially if they haven t seen it . and if they ask what the plot is , just tell  em " it s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film , but that s not important right now . " if you ve seen the film , you ll understand ; - ) '
positiveC,' " psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred " . a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip-off . but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento s most consistently successful film . what impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento s directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative . screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions . no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer . fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called " suspiria de profundis " . the film s storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches . jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance . arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state . what happens next - and i don t make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock s infamous shower scene in psycho . it s quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento s own . though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria s opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school . we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well . several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn t want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film s climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that s most impressive . the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about . fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film . the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region . and the soundtrack ? it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else . as it stands , the use of goblin s music in suspiria is outstanding . apparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts . a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer s overall experience . even better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you ll get the added bonus of widescreen . and the colours ! deep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast . the cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb . a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors . these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento s more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked . suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status . the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that s always been one of argento s shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror .

" ldli , " his first feature , at the 1997 cannes fesival , received a nomination for a golden camera and a special mention , as did john hurt , from the international critics association . john hurt is present in just about every scene . the thespian has a marvelous track record , mostly in roles as different from one another as they are from deja vu . among them , in " a man for all seasons , " " midnight express , " " the elephant man " ( title role ) , " 1984 , " " the hit , " " white mischief , " " scandal , " " rob roy . " he looks like no one else and can act like nobody s business . now in his late 50s , he has the age of giles de ath in " love and death on long island . " british writer de ath lives in contemporary london but not in this century . a widower ( significantly , his wife was older than he , and they had no children ) , he inhabits a world of books in a posh , old-fashioned apartment where his housekeeper follows the man s clockwork routines without intruding into his reclusive habits . he gives no interviews , but when he is finally talked into an appearance on bbc-radio , it is hilarious . giles is befuddled by the questions , the interviewer by the replies . de ath is truly out of the 20th century in every way . " do you use a word processor ? " " i am a writer " he snaps , " i write words , i do not process them . " not that he has the foggiest about what a processor is . or even a typewriter . a notation in the bbc ledger shows us just two words about the man : " fogey " and " cult . " this nagged me throughout the movie . if giles has not a clue about life-at-large , we don t have any about the kind of writing he does ; or why he is a figure in the literary establishment ; or what kind of cult surrounds him , and why . nonetheless , giles is a hoot . the radio interviewer had pointed out to giles , who had not been to the pictures in ages , that films have been made of the novels by e . m . forster . later , locked out of his apartment and caught in the rain , giles notices such a film on a movie-house marquee and goes in . but unaware that there are such innovations as multiplexes , he wanders into an american teen flick , " hotpants college 2 . " with comic slowness it dawns on him that " this is not forster . " he stands up to leave , but sees on the screen a young performer ( jason priestley ) and is entranced by him . giles gets a " coup de foudre , " his first ever love-at-first-sight and undoubtedly his first love ever , at any sight . the heart is a mysterious thing . a major fixation is born . the besotted writer sees the picture again , acting at the box-office like the traditonal , funny kid who wants to buy condoms in a drugstore . tracking down the name of the actor ( it is ronnie bostock ) in comically awkward ways , he loads up on teen magazines which he buys and disposes of as though they were pornography . he reads and memorizes all about ronnie , starts a cut-and-paste " bostockiana " album . giles further enters pop culture by renting ( more comedy here ) all the bostock videos possible . he purchases a video-player , after first mistaking microwave ovens for such machines , has it delivered by a stupefied young man who explains to giles  surprise that a tv set is required to watch the tapes . passion escalates . after more research , howlers and howl-making episodes , giles takes off for the usa , to the long island village where ronnie and his supermodel girlfriend audrey live by the sea . giles , the innocent at home , becomes the innocent abroad . but by now , the comic tone of the first part acquires a lining of pathos , though without losing various funny delights . the second , american ( though shot in canada ) half , has giles take a room in a motel where mostly couples meet furtively ; be obsessed by his wanting to meet ronnie ; resort to a series of investigations and stalkings that involve everything , from ronnie s dog , his porsche ragtop to giles  becoming a regular at the greasy spoonish establishment owned by irv . it is called " chez d irv , " which somehow sounds like " chef d oeuvre " ( french for " masterpiece " ) --a most unlikely bilingual pun , given irv s simple-mindedness love is the mother of inventions . the hitherto very low-key giles goes energetically through loops and hoops , contrives a supermarket " accident " to meet audrey , turns on the charm , makes friends with her while waiting for ronnie to return from california . finally , he meets him . de ath s task is vastly aided by the small community --including the young couple-- being one of naive people with little or no culture . no denizen had ever heard of de ath , perhaps even of literature . but all are hugely impressed by having an english author in their midst . dull , duller , dullest giles becomes an exotic creature . it reminds me a bit of the newly rich vulgarians who mistake bob hope for an earl in " fancy pants . " hurt s performance is probably his best , along with his quentin crisp in " the naked civil servant . " in speech , expressivity , body language , timing , he is impeccably in character , ludicrous and absurd yet believable , quasi farcical yet touching . wide-eyed priestley , sporting elvis sideburns that make him look even dimmer , performs with restraint a persona that s partly an un-blatant send-off of his " beverly hills 90210 " heartthrob , partly that of a young actor who confusedly feels that there are things to do higher than his teen-junk movie roles . the ground is fertile for giles to lay on with a trowel compliments , bold and bald statements about ronnie s talents and potential , the imaginary film script giles is writing for him . all this , of course , leads to implanting the idea that things can go better , not with coke but with de ath as a mentor . to what extent giles believes what he says remains an open question . ronnie s is a supporting role to giles  and audrey s ( well played by a relative newcomer ) is one level below this . the balance of the cast are sub-supporters to the top trio , yet all appearances , down to the tiniest , are sharply sketched out . throughout the film , kwietniowski also fleshes out ambiances through light , economical , amusing touches in the peripherals , from tv watching to weather predictions , not to mention telephone answering machines or faxes . november s attraction to may is something common . so is the mismatched attraction of persons widely separated by social class , taste , intellect , culture . examples abound in movies , from somerset maugham s novel " of human bondage " ( the good version was filmed with leslie howard and bette davis ) to " citizen kane " and beyond . in the case of " love and death " all this acquires new twists and an outcome that i cannot disclose . but i can reveal that there is no sex , there are no caricatures . instead , we get heartfelt sentiment and much humor at the expense of the nadirs of pop culture , teen adulation , as well as of stuffy " high art . " no closure in its fullest sense comes at the end . certain things are left in the air , with an upbeat last-moment hint about giles . there is audience manipulation here , since the title s " death " is a red herring . the name de ath ( pronounced deh as in irish or italian names ) does really exist , but used without the apostrophe , it suggests to the unprepared public dire events rather than a verbal joke . i ll grant you though that it is a good mnemonic device .

( except there s no red , of course . ) the look is so moody and melodramatic that you ll be shocked when you leave the theater . i saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward . often the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts . here the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good , but certainly powerless . his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience . two parts that make up a whole . neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated , disaster is inevitable . the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude . when we finally see the transformation , the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction , not the psychological horror that the tale demands . roberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles . both are suitably melancholy , fitting in with the rest of the film . the only flash of life and color comes from glenn close ( and her lips ) as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives , and surprisingly , jekyll apparently frequents . life and color maybe , but this is not close s best role . she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character . a beautiful film in its own dreary way . you ll appreciate the filmmaking craft , but don t expect to leave in an upbeat mood .

positiveC,' it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of " the horse whisperer , " the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to " projection difficulties . " robert redford s film version of nicholas evans  best-selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december , going head-to-head with " titanic , " but is only now making its much anticipated debut . this ( strategic ? ) delay has allowed " the horse whisperer " to compete , sans fanfare , against some smaller , unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office . no matter . redford s film stands head and shoulders above james cameron s ocean-going tragedy , especially in the writing and acting departments . whatever the reasons for its postponement , " the horse whisperer " supports the old adage " better late than never . " redford has taken evans  book and given it the big screen treatment . while parts of " the horse whisperer " are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial " travelogue " that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast . when her daughter , grace , is involved in a terrible riding accident , hard-driven fashion editor annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace s beloved horse , pilgrim . refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down , annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith-healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker ( redford ) , who has a way with horses and , perhaps , with people too . undeterred by tom s initial reluctance to get involved , annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him , and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal . redford s film unfolds slowly and lovingly , echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds . the film s a little long and , even if you haven t read the book , it s pretty obvious where it s heading--but these are minor complaints . redford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other , but it s scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role . dianne wiest , chris cooper ( " lone star " ) , and sam neill--better than i ve seen him before--round out the respectable supporting cast . and the director s respect for horses is clearly in evidence . one word of warning , however : while brilliantly shot , the accident scene , involving an out-of-control truck , is extremely disturbing . redford s canvas is huge and exquisite . he doesn t hesitate to incorporate vast , sprawling vistas of the american northwest : spectacular , snow-capped mountain ranges , azure skies , and shimmering fields of wheat--all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson s viewfinder . veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity , since " the horse whisperer " is " dances with wolves " by way of " out of africa " ( oscar winners both for barry ) . fortunately , barry s replacement , thomas newman , contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate , human conditions--sonorous , string-laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic , introspective movements ripe with nuance . " the horse whisperer " is that rare kind of movie : it looks good , it feels good , and by golly it does you good . the wait , it turns out , was well worth it . '
positiveC,'  scream 2 , like its predecessor , is a genre-crossing film . it is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery . the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time . scream was also known for its self-referential tone . many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven . again , scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as " sequels suck " and " the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels . " scream 2 s story is very similar to it s predecessor s . sidney ( neve campbell ) , having survived the killing spree in scream , is now in college . gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film , called stab ( which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie scream ) . at the premiere of stab , two students from sidney s college are stabbed to death , and a new story begins . the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer . they want to know all about the links between stab , sidney , and the recent murders . the most complex self-reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference . the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers . the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press . the audience was watching the whole , filmed scene . ( whew . ) the movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a pleasure to watch . even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2 . that s not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep , or even a good movie . the just add to the fun of watching it . i recommend it for other reasons as well . what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural . no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible . it is a person in a mask and a robe , his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims . no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer . the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies , you have less grounds to say " it s just a movie . " the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - gale weathers and deputy dewey ( david arquette , also from the original ) track down a killer . they are likeable , but not outstanding . but in combination with the horror aspect , the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint . it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream . the internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works , so i wonder if i ll be doing the same thing on january 1 , 1999 . if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high , i ll be happy to mark my calendar . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes/ '
positiveC,' as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan s latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . but also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . once again , chan s screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star s character simply jackie , with no last name . this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . of course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter s ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . other plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . the sole purpose of mr . nice guy s existence are chan s comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . director samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan s , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . other impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . none of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop s thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx s daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . but the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film s end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan s athletic prowess ) . filmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan s latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980 s the big brawl and 1985 s the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before .

positiveC,' " southpark : bigger , longer , uncut " before it runs out of steam toward the end , southpark ( which incidentally was cut to secure an r-rating ) is the funniest film of the year . by default ; there haven¹t been many comedies , and certainly none this unabashedly obscene . and , right from the start , you know you¹re in the hands of a couple filmmakers with a keen sense of humor , as kyle , stan , cartman and kenny head off to " a foreign film from canada " , via an hilarious disney rip-off show tune called " mountain town " . iconoclasm in place ; politics are next . the kids can¹t get into the new terrance and phillip film , because it is r-rated ( for good reason ) and they¹re underage . tip , if you find yourself in a similar predicament : bribe the local bum , and no movie or ratings restriction is unbeatable . good thing they get in , too , as the incessantly profane five minutes we see next are a riot , full of as many fart noises and f¹ words as i¹ve seen in that short a time . then comes the hook : comedy central can¹t run " southpark " in all its glory . so , once the boys leave their three-hour marathon of more bad language than they know what to do with , bigger , longer , is caution-to-the-wind cursing . not more than a lot of other r-rated films from , say , martin scorcese ­ like most people seem to be obsessing about ­ mind you . but , still ; the creativity with which these small fries spout about is , ah , a might off-setting . which takes only a few minutes to desensitize us to what we¹re hearing ; i mean , really , you hear ten mutterings of " pig-fucker " or " shit-smeller " ( i may be a little inaccurate with those examples , but you get it ) , and you¹ve heard a lifetime . so , just being crude wouldn¹t be enough . no , series creators trey parker and matt stone are not ones to rest on their considerable laurels , and thus , this southpark feature goes a step or two further with a clever storyline : the parents of our four young anti-heroes are shocked by their newfound vocabulary . a scapegoat is needed , but whom . canadians , of course . war is declared , terrance and phillip are taken hostage and their public execution planned out , and cartman ­ following his humorous ditty , " kyle¹s mom¹s a bitch " , sung by members of several different nationalities ­ gets a chip put in his head that prevents further use of foul language through shock treatment . in the meantime , kenny suffers his usual death , goes to hell , where satan and sadam hussein are lovers , and satan is a big softie and wants to be able to communicate with his partner instead of just having sex all the time . but , nevermind . southpark is entertaining , on top of being sleazy , and that is to be commended . because it didn¹t have to be as good as it is , and who knew . there are a few scratch that , way too many songs ( some funny , some blah ) , and that¹s why i say the film wears out its welcome . before that happens , though , chances are you won¹t laugh more during any other movie this summer than you will , here . highlights : winona ryder¹s performance with a ping-pong ball ; the untimely murder of bill gates ; that " uncle fucker " song from asses of fire ( oh . . my . . god ) ; cartman¹s improvisational use of his neural implant , to save the day . and , needless to say , getting to see the true face of kenny ; can¹t beat that .

positiveC,' susan granger s review of " the closet " ( miramax films ) in this hilarious french farce , a shy , boring accountant ( daniel auteil ) named francois pignon discovers he s going to be fired from his job at a condom factory . lonely and distraught , he contemplates suicide . but then he runs into belone ( michel aumont ) , an elderly homosexual neighbor , who suggests a " sex discrimination " lawsuit to intimidate management . as evidence , belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather-clad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignon s boss . when the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory , not only does pignon get his job back but he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man . his lusty supervisor ( michele laroque ) is so intrigued that she wonders if , perhaps , she could change his sexual preferences . even his ex-wife ( alexandra vandernoot ) and indifferent teenage son ( stanislas crevillen ) drop their disdain . but not everyone is enchanted . a mucho macho co-worker felix ( gerard depardieu ) , a self-righteous homophobe , is stunned and repulsed when he s forced by the pr director ( thierry lhermite ) to grovel and court pignon s friendship or risk losing his own job . writer/director francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness , veering off-track only occasionally into pedophilia . daniel auteuil ( " the widow of saint-pierre " ) is delightful - particularly with a blown-up condom perched on his head , riding on a float in a gay pride parade - and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained , and effective , performances . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the closet " is a frankly sexual , adult 8 . it s so clever , in fact , that hollywood is already planning to re-make it in english , like " la cage aux folles . " '
positiveC,' for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and " high art , " the son s room is an inventive , subtle alternative . written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement . slow is the best description for the film at first . it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family . father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities . they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder . you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome . but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident . the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span . though the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving . though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn t come across as a vanity piece . one might wish he hadn t picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character s reactions so predictable . what saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction . the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss . you start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing . you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation . even better are the role reversals that take place within the household . while giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot . not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them . these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change . respectfully , gender issues never enter the picture . self-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family . though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives . most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing . in contrast , the son s room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters . it s not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to .

positiveC,' directed by richard lagravenese . cast : holly hunter , danny devito , queen latifah , martin donovan , elias koteas , suzanne shepherd , eddie cibrian , rachael leigh cooke , lin shaye . 1998 - 94 minutes . rated r ( for profanity , brief nudity , and sexual situations ) . reviewed november 11 , 1998 . by dustin putman  dustin putman s film reviews  " living out loud , " is the type of motion picture we don t often see : it is a film about mature , intelligent adults , instead of the usual american film , in which children basically dress up in grown-up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven-year-olds . judith ( holly hunter ) , a fortysomething living in new york city , has been having a difficult time with life lately . she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) , who had been cheating on her . she cannot sleep , haunted by terrible memories , often imagines off-the-wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place , and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers , liz bailey ( queen latifah ) , perform at a local club . judith s life does start to brighten a little when , one night when she gets home to her apartment late , strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator , pat ( danny devito ) , a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently . both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other , seeking comfort with the other person , but while pat starts to form a deep love for her , judith only wants to remain friends . " living out loud , " which was written by richard lagravenese ( " the bridges of madison county " ) , who is also making his directing debut here , is a wonderful film from beginning to end , one that is honest , genuinely funny , and poignant . the three central characters , that of judith , pat , and liz , are all written to be free-thinking , complex human beings , and are all likable , but flawed , people who are constantly interesting , as is the film itself . one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen . sometimes it results in comedy , and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching . one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself , reading a novel . an older woman comes over to her , mentions that that is a great book she is reading , and then goes over to join her own friends . as the woman sits down , she looks over to see judith by herself , and motions for her to come join them . instantly , we realize this was simply in judith s mind , as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends . holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here . hunter , of course , was brilliant in 1993 s " the piano , " for which she won an academy award , but in this film she is even better , i think . she finds the right note for each scene and holds it . and devito has never had such a humanistic role before , which i was surprised about . usually he is used as the butt of a joke , or as a caricature , but in this film , has a living-and-breathing , sympathetic person to play . topping it all off is latifah , also a singer , who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself , and has a juicy , natural supporting role as , in some ways , judith s role model . another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived , " happy " ending , but , in staying with its realistic tone , manages to be upbeat , but truthful . the last shot is an especially powerful image . nothing is said , but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all . the relationship that results between judith and pat is true-to-life and sincere . as we watch these two people talk , and get to know each other , all that we wish for them both is to be happy , even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved . and as , " living out loud , " which is one of the best films of the year , proves , sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for . '
positiveC,' jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation . even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation . this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction . to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk  til dawn . he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide . ( i m willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him . ) tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director s helm . nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own . the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her . jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas . this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico . however , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs . jackie didn t know they were in the package with the cash , but that s of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted . of course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell . ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police . sure enough , ordell shows up at jackie s apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she " borrows " max s pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell . instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol s chamber to ordell s head , jackie proposes a deal . since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell s half million dollars . with a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ? by itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film . however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think . jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she s also making a deal with the feds as well as with max . the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around . instead , it s actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today s movies . at least this film has a little imagination . most of the performances in jackie brown are above par . pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable . samuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control . robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . . never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy s apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course . he s just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn t occur to us , even when we re shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade . in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell s , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town . unfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences . in this film , he s not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , " little bit , " and " pretty much . " fonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side . as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy . it grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves . don t count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however . there s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he s not really sure what s happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what s going on is felt simultaneously by the audience . we look at the screen and think , " gee , that s clever , " and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on . although tarantino isn t afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film . there are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head . this is a tribute to both direction and acting . however , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something . we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she s looking for , but instead hoping she ll just stop . overall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well . some flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it s really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today . in fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these " offensive " words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness . go see the film and see what i mean . '
positiveC,' a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal . a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another . a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain . a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end . if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues . it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label . edward zwick s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states . you d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines . arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack . however , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden s camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal . in retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world . unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau s new york office at one federal plaza . while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information . generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm . even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country . hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government . the original tagline for patriot games was , " there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . " however true , it was pulled before the movie s release because it sounded too much like a dare . revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america . admittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid . i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order . it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself . in fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk . although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups . throughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully . what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides . it actually gets rather heady at times , but it s a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don t underestimate the intelligence of the audience . i don t know if it s his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great . this , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable . annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i ve seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable . it s somewhat unfortunate that her character s fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range . bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face . however , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film s development . notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant . the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society . difficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch . perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom " wings , " shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night . whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick s favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer . i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most . revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole . it s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we ve been getting throughout the year . missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes . for example , it s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick . unfortunately , there s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching . in the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops . verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point . the film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along . a noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously . these flaws are glaring , but they don t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class .

positiveC,' " it s not important how many people i ve killed . what s important is how i get along with the people that are still alive , " jimmy " the tulip " tudeski ( bruce willis ) solemnly informs a very nervous nick " oz " oseransky ( matthew perry ) once oz discovers jimmy s profession . this line , and the way in which it is delivered , are great examples of how funny " the whole nine yards " can be . the problem is , that while it can be hilarious , the film also has a tendancy to drag at times . the ending goes on for far too long , and the humor occasionally falls flat . however , when the film pulls its humor off , it s hysterical . oz is a dentist who is so tired of life with his commanding wife , sophie ( rosanna arquette ) , that he spends his mornings smashing his head against his steering wheel while driving to work . his secretary , jill ( a hilarious amanda peet ) , is constantly trying to convince him to divorce his wife but oz knows that sophie will get everything in the divorce settlement . to add to his miseries , oz discovers that his new neighbor is hitman , jimmy " the tulip " tudeski . it turns out that there is a price on jimmy s head , courtesy of his associate back in chicago , yanni gogolack ( kevin pollak ) . sophie wants oz to go back to chicago , deliver the whereabouts of jimmy , and collect a finder s fee . oz is of course averse to doing this , since it will most likely involve jimmy s killing oz upon his return . once he arrives in chicago , oz meets up with another hitman named frankie figgs ( michael clark duncan ) , who is apparently working for yanni . the situation grows steadily worse for poor oz from there . " the whole nine yards " is one of those fun movies like " mars attacks " and " galaxy quest " , where you can tell that the entire cast is having a great time making the film . when a cast acts in this manner it usually carries over to the audience , as is the case here . bruce willis s comic talents lie mainly in his deadpan delivery of lines , and he is given ample oppurtunity to display this talent throughout the film . i believe that matthew perry s primary talent is his wide range of facial expressions , and again , he is given the chance to utilize this ability throughout the movie . despite the considerable comic abilities of both these actors , they are overshadowed by amanda peet s ( " isn t she great " , " simply irresistable " ) hysterical performance as the secretary who wants desperately to become a contract killer . " the whole nine yards " has an amazingly complex plot , considering what a goofy little movie it appears to be at first glance . the film is filled with double crosses , backstabbing , and false identities . every character involved wants some other character dead , and there are various little subplots relating to these . unlike " gun shy " from earlier this year , the romantic elements to " the whole nine yards " don t feel tacked on and useless . though difficult to take seriously , they blend with the rest of the film quite well . the cast members work very well together , particularly bruce willis and amanda peet . the two of them have a grand old time playing teacher and student in a very unlikely profession . peet is so overcome with hero worship for the elder hitman , she is willing to do anything ( and i mean anything ) to win his approval . the only cast member i found to be rather out of place here was rosanna arquette as the hideous wife of oz . the problem is , i can t imagine anyone playing a grotesque character like this . the other major flaw with the film is the amount of time spent on the ending . the movie could have ended fifteen minutes earlier than it does with no problem . one more thing i must note is that " the whole nine yards " is definitely a guy movie . nearly every guy in the theatre i attended was laughing uproariously at the movie , while most of the women present seemed rather baffled by the humor . " the whole nine yards " runs a little too long at 100 minutes , but it doesn t start to drag too badly till the end . i d recommend it to fans of matthew perry and bruce willis . if you dislike these actors , i d suggest you stay far away from this one . i give the movie three and a half out of five stars .

positiveC,' losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing . reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare . while we all might feel the desire to blow someone s head off with a shotgun when they don t seem to grasp our point of view , actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid . this isn t the case with sam baily - john travolta s slightly askew average-joe persona in mad city . " i don t think people listen to guys like me , " sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum . just a few days ago , sam was a guard at this same museum , but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position , sam s apprehension resulted in a brash decision . in an effort to get his ex-boss , museum director mrs . banks ( blythe danner ) , to " just listen " , he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun , taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage . sam s overall concern is valid enough - if he loses his job , his paycheck , his benefits , etc . , his wife and two children won t be provided for . he s not a lunatic or a hot-tempered madman , he s somewhat like a child - panicky , compulsive , and running on emotion - and his naive intentions aren t helped any by the fact that banks wasn t overly compassionate with the let go . overall , he s just like you and me - except that he has the capacity to view the line we d deem " far enough " as the starting mark of some crazy race . meanwhile , television reporter max brackett ( dustin hoffman ) is also on the scene . covering a " fluff " story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks , max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest-breaking news story he ever could ve hoped for . having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting , max is anxious to turn this into his , and only his , story . max immediately bonds with sam . max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone . at first , max s intentions don t stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole pride factor , but as he gets to know sam more personally , he begins to sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him . the media , however , is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill . the accidental shooting of ex-co- worker cliff ( bill nunn ) , a black security guard , becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sam s honest ambitions . also involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts , head of the news department of the station max falls directly under , and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander , who uses his network power to try and outshine max . alda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities . then there is mia kirshner , who plays the young tv station intern laurie . she falls under max s wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting . kirshner s credits are relatively small for now , including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel to the crow . still , kirshner s character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and kinda-bitchy-in-a-reserved-way roles . i wouldn t mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts , where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen . while the viewpoint of the media as a greedy , self-righteous monster has indeed been tackled before , mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability . hoffman and travolta are both excellent actors , and seeing them together is a real treat . they both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters , and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both . there is quite a bit of humor in this film , and without it , it could ve fallen into a drab , cliched social statement more likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause . this isn t a flick that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart , but it will lightly touch both , making for a recommendable movie . if for nothing more than the opportunity to watch both hoffman and travolta at the same time , i urge you to check this one out .

positiveC,' modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop-broadway musical rather than victor hugo s original tome . adapted several times for the cinema , this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters , story , and heart of the novel to the screen . liam neeson stars as jean valjean . as a young man , valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger . . . and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes . prison hardened him , and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor . however , an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life , and he vows to become a better man . however , he runs up against one man who doesn t believe in reform . inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider . he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions . he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice . two women also get caught up in the struggle . fantine ( uma thurman ) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society . her daughter , cosette ( mimi newman , and later , claire danes ) , is her life , yet she cannot afford to raise her . instead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave . director bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo s novel , which , though omitting some of the political undertones , remains true to the overall story and tone of the book . hopefully you won t , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went . the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes . the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles . neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past . the supporting cast is also extraordinary . the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius . the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film . the novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length . while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie , this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation . it , too , is an epic . . . and one worth seeing .

positiveC,' review by lars lindahl ( larsattacks@mail . com ) " gladiator " ( 2000 )   starring russell crowe , joaquin phoenix , connie nielsen , derek jacobi , richard harris , oliver reed , and djimon hounsou . imagine this . you re given a sword and a shield and very basic , minimal training . a man you don t know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live . you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die . you frantically monitor several closed doors which , in seconds , will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you . you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood . if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you , you know you re going to have to do it all over again tomorrow . eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are , you re going to die . this is the life of a gladiator . you ll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott s powerful gladiator , you ll be thankful for that . with his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire . and like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script . since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited . from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious . rome s best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a . d . that is ) waging a war against germania . scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective . it s blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted . as soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who . it s a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch . instead , the general swears he will get out after this battle . he wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life . but , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that . the dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies . he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators . all of this does not go well for aurelius  son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor . jealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus  wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus . but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius  wishes . now a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success . a story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick . you actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way . phoenix plays his character brilliantly . think of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , " respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man " brat who hates when he s not the center of attention . every scene we see commodus , he s either crying or he looks like he has just been crying . phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for , and gladiator shows he s more than just river s little brother . crowe is also excellent as the film s grisly-faced hero . maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions . this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act , he s no invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners , he ( believe it or not ) acts like a human being ! the rest of the cast , including richard harris , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and connie nielsen are also first rate . ridley scott , using outstanding special effects , has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum , the loudness of the roman mob , and the city of rome in general . the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous , like a cleopatra of the year 2000 . the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians . gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience . along with u-571 , action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000 .

positiveC,' director : alan parker writers : alan parker and oliver stone ( based on the musical by andrew lloyd webber and tim rice ) starring : madonna , antonio banderas , jonathan pryce , jimmy nail , andrea corr andrew lloyd webber s musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time . webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as " oklahoma ! , " or the slapstickness of shows like " a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . " they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics . like " jesus christ superstar , " which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune " superstar , " a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn t spread his message wider ) , " evita " takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan perón , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . " evita " deals with the rise and fall of eva perón , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn t like di slept to " the top " ) . webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . it s also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . the film plays like a rock opera , much like their " jesus christ superstar , " with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . after all , this is a musical , and webber s musicals never undermine this . they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . this is why the beginning of " evita " is kind of a let-down . okay , it is a let-down . i m not saying the opening moments are bad , because they re pretty good . but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand . in the musical , it s a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , " buenos aires , " which is also lifeless . then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , " another suitcase in another hall , " which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it s being narrated by a hater of eva s , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . for a while , it looks like alan parker can t pull it off . however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song " goodbye and thank you , " where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical . no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work . juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . from the " goodbye and thank you " number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation s people downtrodden . but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . that s when our narrator , ché , comes out to show that she wasn t the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he s said to be based on the revolutionary ché guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he s done " fame , " " the committments , " " bugsy malone , " and " pink floyd the wall " - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is . we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . and there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings " don t cry for me , argentina , " and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . madonna s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . at the beginning , she looks like she s too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . her death , though , is brilliant . her singing could be better though . i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she s trying to hard . she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti lupone - i heard her sing on an old " evita " cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . but it s generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . antonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i m one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator . his singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . he does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . although it gets off to a rocky start ( " rocky "  s polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . like the other musical released in  96 ( woody allen s " everyone says i love you " ) , it s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance .

" crazy/beautiful " suffers from the damned-if-you-do , damned-if-you-don t syndrome . after a spate of flighty , cookie-cutter teen films , the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story . but rather than applaud the production , early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown " afterschool special . " even worse , in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people , the studio got a case of the heebie-jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re-shoot scenes and cut footage to " tone things down . " needless to say , the filmmaker was frustrated . " we were trying to make a cautionary tale , " he told newsweek , " and we couldn t show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from . " regardless , the film works , thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes . " crazy/beautiful " is quality fare , good enough that i half-expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for " failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes . " set in pacific palisades , calif . , the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens . every morning and evening , carlos nunez ( jay hernandez ) takes a two-hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school . an honor student and star athlete , carlos is responsible , modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy . all is well until he meets nicole oakley ( kirsten dunst ) , the daughter of a rich congressman ( bruce davison ) . nicole is a drunk apparently hell-bent on self-destruction . carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her , but he is only human and she has the greatest smile . plus , as her father notes , she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral . as with " save the last dance , " " crazy/beautiful " ( god , how i hate lower-case titles ) takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh . while noting the racial and social differences between the kids , the screenplay dances around most of the clichés ( there are still several mtv moments , though ) . the filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there . cute-as-a-button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole s behavior . she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down , i hoped the boy would listen . as carlos , hernandez is a revelation . hunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team , the young man can really act ; we will see a lot of this guy in the future . aside from its title , the biggest problem with " crazy/beautiful " is its ending , which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy . after carefully presenting credible characters and situations , the conclusion feels rushed and lazy . still , this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots . " afterschool special " my ass  " crazy/beautiful " is the real deal . '
positiveC,' towards the middle of " the sweet hereafter , " a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend , careens through the steel guard rail , and disappears out of sight . then , in long shot , we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow-covered field . it pauses for a moment before the " field " cracks under the bus  weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment , a single smooth second of time . compare that scene , if you will , to the last eighty minutes of " titanic , " when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise , and you ll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films . the scene in " the sweet hereafter " epitomizes all that s right with independent canadian director atom egoyan s film . it s not sensational . we don t see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming , terrified children being bloodied and battered about . the bus doesn t explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces . it simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake . it s a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance . using a non-linear approach to his narrative , egoyan shifts back and forward in time , connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy . fourteen children died in the accident , leaving their parents and the town itself paralyzed with grief . the catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens ( a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm ) , who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit . stephens , who " doesn t believe in accidents , " functions as a concerned , involved observer , scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath . while stephens  initial drive may be financial ( one third of the total settlement if he wins ) , his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss . his self-destructive , drug-addicted daughter has been in and out of clinics , halfway houses and detox units for years . egoyan s attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry . mychael danna , who composed the shimmering music for " the ice storm , " contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles . equally impressive is paul sarossy s cinematography , capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides and low-hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors--in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room . " the sweet hereafter , " while undeniably grim , urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go . it s a film of generous subtlety and emotion . '
positiveC,' until i saw the night of the hunter , it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie . forget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ) , the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i ve seen so far this year . even though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there s a not drop of blood to be seen . luckily , the night of the hunter , charles laughton s first and final directing gig , has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re-released in october 2001 . so , there s still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place . robert mitchum stars as harry powell , a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash . his newest target is young mother willa harper ( shelley winters ) , whose murderer husband ben ( peter graves ) has hidden $10 , 000 somewhere . powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs . harper after he s released and ben is hanged . but finding the money isn t easy for powell , who must contend with his stepchildren ( billy chapin and sally jane bruce ) , who know where the money is , but aren t telling . the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments , thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time . how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies ? what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin ? ( no , i m not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem . ) yes , there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter . powell s " love " and " hate " knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing ( remember radio raheem ? ) . and powell s black suit , with black tie and white shirt , could have shaped quentin tarantino s early visual style . seeing the night of the hunter for the first time , i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact . you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club . he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears . he s like the senior class president with an evil streak . if i ever need to stay awake , i ll just picture him crooning , " leaning . . . leaning . . . . " any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah . and credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez , who create a series of haunting , surreal shadowy images over the rural depression-era backdrop . it s a testament to both men that they re able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline ( kids harassed by evil guardians ) by sticking to the old maxim that we re more scared by what we don t see . screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters : the drunk birdie ( james gleason ) who s haunted by his wife , and the spoons ( evelyn varden and walt spoon ) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act . the only lapse is the movie s third act , when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly , bible-reading mrs . cooper ( lillian gish ) . her showdown with powell is memorable -- a battle done with dueling hymns . however , the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone , but it s still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun . do yourself favor and don t miss this if it comes to a nearby theater . note : a series of revealing , but overlong , outtakes preceded the movie . the highlights included the legendary laughton ( who sounds eerily like mr . pitt from seinfeld ) running winters  lines with mitchum , and the adorable , tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile . hours more of such footage exists , as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling . screened as part of the 2001 new york film festival retrospectives ( feature story coming soon ) .

positiveC,' director : tom holland writers : don mancini , john lafia , and tom holland starring : catherine hicks , alex vincent , chris surrandon , brad douriff , dinah manoff , tommy swerdlow , jack colvin , neil guintoli we all know the fate of " child s play , " which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell . with the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be " bride of chucky " - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it s kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about . alas , the original " child s play " actually isn t that bad . even seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn t the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don t believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn t a bad movie . it s not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don t have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , " i know what you did last summer " has recently gone . the premise of " child s play " is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid s doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid s doll i ve ever seen . the next day , a bum who s stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday . of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up . like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy . and soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky isn t just a kiddie doll one by one . the idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that . it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they re crazy . it plays with this , as well as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments . even if there s an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later ! ) , there s also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat , and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes , leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience . the ending is rather fun , as well , albeit a tad too drawn-out ( about four different endings , maybe five ) , and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line-up , making them easier to sympathize with . if there s one horrible thing about many horror films , it s that the protagonists are morons who you can t help but shout obscenities at , and for the most part , " child s play " steers away from that . and most of all , the chucky character is a good one , not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look ! that doll s moving on its own ! ) , but because he s a generally scary character . if there s anything really wrong with " child s play , " it s that it s too trite and has too less self esteem . at almost 90 minutes , " child s play " features way too less to be a real classic of horror . it throws itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren t for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll . if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting , it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism , which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film . . . which isn t necessarily a bad thing . as such , " child s play " is content to be just the short , typical horror film , but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasi-campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short , typical horror film .

positiveC,' starship troopers ( 1997 ) rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity .  starring : casper van dien , denise richards , dina meyer , jake busey , neil patrick harris , patrick muldoon , and michael ironside . ladies and gentlemen , 1997 s independence day is here ! it s title : starship troopers . and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . i realize that i gave last year s sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn t as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review . starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film . in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film . starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether . while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : " the  star wars  of the 90s . " am i being to generous to this film ? perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a " kick-the-aliens -asses " style . id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . this new " star wars " has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects . however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . and they should be . i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film . this is an " event " film , but surprisingly above average . it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange " join the army " ads . mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . stating , " would you like to know more ? " , these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . however , carmen isn t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . unfortunately , rico isn t interested in dizzy . this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch . carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up . and as a result , dizzy signs up . everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry . the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships . in reality , i found myself watching a space version of " melrose place , " but with better special effects . an hour into the film , the war begins . a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs  attacks . a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . the troopers are ordered to locate the " brain " and capture it . i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . it s about special effects and gory violence . director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year s event horizon . the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . my guess is that verhoeven s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . while watching the film , we never second guess the character s decisions because they seem perfectly clear . thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . to most guys , he will come across as artificial . fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . her dizzy is extremely likeable . denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . jake busey , gary busey s son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . however , he does give a good performance . michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . his performance rises above the rest . perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside s presence on screen . unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . director verhoeven is the main star of the film . his direction is fast and unrelentless . he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . the writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . the dialogue is smart but not too smart . we aren t required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . thankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don t ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . i haven t laughed this loud , even in some comedies . oh , and the special effects are first rate . starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . believe me when i say this : don t take young kids to see this film . it is extremely violent . in fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . however , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . it s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . and still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . now that would be entertaining !

positiveC,' susan granger s review of " bread and tulips " ( first look pictures ) in this delightfully frothy italian romantic comedy , after accidentally being left behind by a tour bus while on a family vacation with her cranky husband and two cynical teenagers , rosalba ( licia maglietta ) , an unhappy housewife from pescara , finds herself - and love - in venice . for the first time in years , rosalba s on her own when she s abandoned at a highway rest area . although her philandering husband ( antonio catania ) , a plumbing-supply dealer , orders her to stay there until she s picked up , she impulsively accepts a ride to venice , a bohemian paradise which she s never visited . rosalba finds refuge and romance with fernando ( bruno ganz ) , a gruff icelandic waiter who offers her a spare room in his modest apartment and prepares breakfast for her each morning . to support herself , she gets a job working with a florist ( antonio catania ) . film-maker silvio soldini gently explores the blossoming of this bored , middle-aged , middle-class woman with warmth and affection , savoring special moments such as when rosalba starts playing the accordion again and abandons her maroon stretch pants , silver jacket and orange sneakers for a simple , new red-and-white dress with platform-soled espadrilles . the superb actors slip into their roles seamlessly , particularly luminous licia maglietta and low-key bruno ganz , along with marina massironi as her nosy massage-therapist neighbor and giuseppe massironi as the inept plumber-turned-private eye who s sent to retrieve her on orders from her frantic husband - who s discovered that his mistress has no interest in doing his laundry or cleaning the house . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " bread and tulips " is a beguiling , escapist 8 . as the summer ends , it s a magical getaway for mature audiences . .

positiveC,' slavery is bad . after hundreds of years , we ve finally figured that one out . this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg s latest " serious " film . during the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa s west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . fifty-three of them are stuffed into the " la amistad " ( from a spanish word for " friendship " ) by their new spanish owners . freeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt . after killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think . instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states . the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy . the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property . if they are property , who do they belong to ? their masters ? the spanish government ? salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? the us government ? the defendants are pawns in several games . abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . their lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . south carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends . when the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes . even that doesn t work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims . at the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners . this little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america s past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court . the slavery issue is easy pickin s for spielberg . much like his " shindler s list " ( which followed " jurassic park " as this follows " lost world " ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose . nazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . it s not hard to see who the bad guys are . without that question to ponder , the director s job is more difficult . he has to make the story interesting . spielberg succeeds for the most part . the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . there are very few _people_ in the tale . in fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . tappan and joadson are " abolitionists " : symbols but not humans . van buren is a weak politician but nothing else . the rest of the " slaves " barely exist other than dressing for the set . like many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . the film s salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . the former model s first major role is a winner . without speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog . the other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in " nixon " ) . the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen . there are some other great moments . especially impressive are the african s struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land . their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant . as grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans . more humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film .

" ) is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel . the participants include vera ( whoopi goldberg ) and merrill ( lanai chapman ) , a newly reunited mother and daughter ; disgraced pro football referee owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) ; italian tourist mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) ; randy pear ( jon lovitz ) and his family ; the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody ( seth green and vince vieluf ) ; and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) . various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city . screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another . the most side-splitting situations involve vera and merrill s encounter with the squirrel lady , a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates ; owen s commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look-alikes on their way to a lucy convention ; the cody brothers misadventures with a hot-air balloon , a flying cow and a monster truck ; and the pear family s stopover at a barbie museum , which turns out not to be what they think it is . the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman s script builds the laughs . without going into detail , this bit segues from the museum to hitler s touring car , to eva braun s dark lipstick , to lovitz burning his tongue , culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans . rat race s cast is first rate . cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap ; lovitz is , at first , a bit whiny , but his character grows on you ; gooding is having a fine romp ; and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese s deadpan assistant , a man " born without a personality . " the film is directed by jerry zucker , who knows something about comedy . along with his brother , david , and friend jim abrahams , he was responsible for such hits as airplane ! and ruthless people . a throwaway subplot , which is good for some laughs , features cleese and his buddies , betting on a series of outlandish situations , including one dealing with a hooker and pepto-bismol . this is a fun little feature . the only letdown comes at the finale , which is too touchy-feely and sweet , almost negating what came before it . rat race is a summer sleeper , but it will keep you awake , as will the laughter of those watching around you . bob bloom is the film critic at the journal and courier in lafayette , in . he can be reached by e-mail at bloom@journal-courier . com or at bobbloom@iquest . net .  other reviews by bloom can be found at www . jconline . com by clicking on golafayette . bloom s reviews also can be found on the web at the internet movie database : http : //www . imdb . com/m/reviews_by ? bob + bloom '
positiveC,' release date : september 25 , 1998 starring : robert de niro , jean reno , jonathan pryce , natascha mcelhone , stellan skarsgard , sean bean , katarina witt directed by : john frankenheimer distributed by : metro-goldwyn-mayer mpaa rating : r ( strong violence , some language ) url : http : //www . execpc . com/~kinnopio/reviews/1998/ronin . htm there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie . action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle . for fans of both genres , however , realism is key . action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie s end . on this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr . moreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin . the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that s fallen into the same category over the last few years . the script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago . a certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times . frankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck . his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it . robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time . he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who s called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package . the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik . at times , however , zeik s tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise s computer disk . fortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened . the action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews . the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness . ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots . the suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie s open . considering these factors it s good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it s another good bet this month . since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it s definitely worth the visit .

positiveC,' tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently . the dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months . " kundun " ( " presence " , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader . a group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention . the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as " mine " . he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country . he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950 . the peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results . eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india . comparisons to " seven years in tibet " are inevitable . both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner s point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt . " kundun " features only native actors and is more of an insider s story . in some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made " seven years " such an audience-pleaser . the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons ) . the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character . on an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts . some events are depicted differently and pitt s austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama s life isn t even mentioned here . glossed over in " seven years " , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses " we were just about to change things " after the chinese attack . the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins . his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail . especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain . the visual treats more than make up for the movie s faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience . walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience . martin scorsese , known for his dark tales of the underworld ( " goodfellas " , " taxi driver " , " casino " ) has shifted gears . something of a thematic follow-up to his " the last temptation of christ " , this is his slowest film yet . oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese , most of these events take place off-screen . his decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable . the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations . philip glass s score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting . i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again . hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india , i was struck by what was missing in the movie . as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is , there is a distance between the audience and the movie . the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings . with the exception of a few scenes , involvement with the characters is slight . one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama , shown as a mischievous boy who can t resist being a kid sometimes . an encounter with his older brother thubten j . norbu ( a retired indiana university professor ) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment , but there aren t many of these . even with its problems , the " kundun " experience is phenomenal , but one that i fear most will miss . many people who saw " seven years in tibet " will have a " been there , done that " attitude . it s likely that the film will miss a wide-spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping .

positiveC,' when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . i m happy to say that there s something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs . in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . earl brown ) , who s being harassed by one of the school jocks . it seems warren s sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . ted was just flattered that she even knew his name . unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn t seen since that fateful day . with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . there s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you ll not only enjoy , but also won t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers  last two films ) they almost all work . i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . one minute you ll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary s apartment . one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . ted s a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don t always work out . it s comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . actually , i ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties . the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler . it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived " the ben stiller show " on the fox network in late  92/early  93 . like " the critic " ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show s cancellation . cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . however , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she s got guys just falling over each other to be with her . heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn t change , and you know , it s really true . he and ralph macchio must hang out or something . maybe they live in dick clark s pool house . anyway , here s another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary s heart . the supporting performances are also good . chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . lin shae , who plays mary s neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . lee evans , as mary s friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren t any noticeable times where the film drags . the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera . it s a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . after that it got a little annoying , and it s unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow . fortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater .

positiveC,' bowfinger -a review by bill chambers ( bowfinger@filmfreakcentral . net ) ( for screen , dvd , and reviews , plus cool contests , visit : film freak central - http : //filmfreakcentral . net bring a date . ) steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for " the new yorker , " several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 ) . much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called " in search of the wily filipino . " now , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations (  everything being made now is crap  ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood . martin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned . his accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called " chubby rain , " about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops . bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america s top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star . ramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously . he sends his cast members ( who aren t in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey s table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc . , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance . the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time . ramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities . ( as if that s not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l . ron hubbard , founder of scientology . ) when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble " white code " in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in . murphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey s adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage . always surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself . furthermore , consider the enemies he ll make of popular scientologists . pacing stricter s neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly . murphy s scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta " clearing . " not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin s invention . his script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry . ( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerry renfro . ) martin s decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder s point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture . as expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin s crew of mexican border-jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading " cahiers du cinema , " or martin s nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollars ( ! ) . most of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen . bowfinger s main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath . we re also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem " chubby rain , " z-grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush . ( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz s last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out . ) these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece . as i mentioned at the start of this review , bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham s character daisy does : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom . that said , it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus : the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome . martin gets sentimental by story s end as he did in l . a . story , and how could he not ? for those who can hack it , the movies might be the greatest business in the world .

" in hard rain a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding . everyone has had to evacuate because it s raining , and now floodwaters are rising so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about to break . enter a working class smart-alecky new armored car driver named tom ( christian slater ) . suddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters . tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money , hide it , and swim for his life . this makes for an action movie full of jet skis , speedboat chases , and gun battles , as tom tries to evade and outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the national guard can answer his distress call . he is befriended and aided by a spunky churchgoing young woman from town named karen ( minnie driver ) . but unknown to tom and karen , the national guard never heard tom s initial distress call . will tom and karen survive the natural and manmade disasters ? opinion : don t expect thought-provoking issues or dramatics . there s not much more to this movie than hiding , running , swimming , shooting , and saving handcuffed heroes from drowning , but that s what makes it escapist and fun . relax , take your shoes off , and break out the popcorn .

positiveC,' director : tony kaye writer : david mckenna starring : edward norton , edward furlong , avery brooks , fairuza balk , beverly d angelo , stacy keach , jennifer lien , ethan suplee , guy torry , eliott gould , william russ , paul le mat it s tough to really say something nice about a type of person who s so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , " american history x " does it , and for that , i commend it . it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who s not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off . the subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack . he s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks . he s so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process . his name is derek vinyard , and he s played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he s almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he s clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn t need them . he so believes in his convictions that he s willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years . " american history x " is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake . we see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he s done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides . or at least , that s the intention . the film s framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek s deep space 9 ) , is trying to " correct " him . when the film opens , danny has just written a book report on " mein kampf , " landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek s life and how it has gotten him nowhere . coincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he s cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . he s just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he s wisened up . he s no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who s becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle . but danny won t . he goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago . the film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white . we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on . to them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them . and frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true . " american history x " is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next . in it , there are some of the best scenes i ve seen all year . one scene features a dinner between derek s family , and his mother s newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek s rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould s reaction to derek s final summation is unnerrving ) . another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison . and another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year . there s much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he s given in what seems like a really long time ) . norton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble . in only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best . there s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing . sadly enough , this isn t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be . it s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece . the ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon . some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the " fat skinhead , " whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn t as well travelled . furlong s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn t seem like it has actually arrived there . even derek s descent into skinhead-dom doesn t seem justified . though his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from " boy meets world , " and don t ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs . as such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed . sorta . " american history x " is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential . somewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus . although he aimed for the directing credit to go to " alan smithee , " the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn t allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that s the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) . kaye s right in that it s not up to par , even if he s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par . this will not be a " do the right thing " for the late 90s . yet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one s own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) . and even if it isn t perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he s done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience .

positiveC,' based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider-man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half-vampire half-human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire s latest meal . now swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all . his latest challenge is his biggest though . . . he must stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires . admitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some . judging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film . to some degree , i agree with this sentiment . having read comic books since the age of nine ( i m 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , #5 , blade . ( " men in black " is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book ) why is this ? for the most part , it is because the filmmakers understandthe comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match . the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided . the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect . superman is not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this . blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere . this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher s contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960 s television show . batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i m working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i m ready ) . which brings me back to blade . although he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon . the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends . the end results are not pretty by any means . the story elements work very well -- for a comic book story . screenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films . this is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n bushe wright . this leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires . add this to the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an " anti-theft device " ) , and one has an interesting premise . however , the film works best as an action film . actor wesley snipes hasan extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move . proving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a good example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes . regardless , this film is far from perfect . the film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god . the ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on marked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) . obvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) . much of the special effects are not that spectacular either . while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film s release date was pushed back multiple times ) . scenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i m really hard to impress ) . the film s r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of realism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence , '
positiveC,' starring mark whalberg , burt reynolds , julianne moore and heather graham one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length . if a film is only 90 minutes , but feels like 300 minutes , then it s crap . but if a film last 2 1/2 hours , and feels like 90 minutes , then it s excellent . boogie nights falls into the latter catagory . the director , anderson , delivers a funny , hip , yet sometimes violent film , which flies along . mark whalberg , a . k . a marky mark , plays eddie adams , a seventeen year old with a certain  gift  in the midriff area . jack horner ( reynolds ) is a adult film director , who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business . after running away from home , eddie joins jack , changes his name to dirk diggler , and starts making erotic movies . in the movie business , dirk meets a whole load of characters ( which the film introduces very quickly and slickly ) such as scotty ( phillip seymour hoffman ) , rollergirl ( graham ) amber ( moore ) and floyd ( phillip baker hall ) , and little bill ( william h . macy ) all the characters are well written , well played , and the audience gets to know them pretty well , thanks to the excellent script . we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce , rollergirls hard time at school , and little bills wife , who sleeps with everyone except her husband . but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing . the direction is fast , thrilling , and never holds up . there are some great shots , some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences , and lots of other neat directional touches . the writing is fabulous , with some intelligent dialogue , some funny dialogue , but none of the dialogue is crap , like most hollywood films ( such as the lost world : jurassic park ( 1997 ) , or tommorow never dies ( 1997 ) . ) boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing , on par ( and sometimes betters ) quentin tarantino s films resevoir dogs ( 1992 ) and pulp fiction ( 1994 ) the soundtrack is also excellent . like american graffiti ( 1973 ) , the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack , which heightens the atmosphere , and gives the film an extra lift . also , the costumes are great . the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties . the film , although excellent , does have some flaws . firstly , wahlberg , although excellent , cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry . in both scenes where he has to act angry , his acting is so  off  , the scenes tension and anger is lost . but the rest of the cast are excellent . burt reynolds is brilliant , julianne moore shows real emotion , and william h . macy is great aswell ( but he always is . ) another flaw with the film , though , is that the ending seems a bit tacked on . it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit , and needed to wrap up quickly . it s a shame , really , as the rest of the film is perfectly paced . but they re small niggles really . boogie nights is an excellent film . superb directing , writing , acting and music , all combine to make one spectacular film . whatever you do , do not miss out on boogie nights .

( it also helps to get more black votes , of course ) . as jemmons , billy bob thornton is a projection of james carville . and so on , down the line . the film s opening is an inspired , funny visual and aural essay on the variety of hand-shakes the governor uses . it would stand by itself as a prize-winning short . then the portrait of jack is expanded , amplified and constantly added to . the man is a consummate politico who can pretend , manipulate , cajole , inspire , move , cheat , you name it , he can do it . in his first dramatic appearance , in a new york school where he encourages minority adults to get an education , stanton follows the sad tale of a black man whom illiteracy has seriously damaged , raptly and with swelling tear ducts . he segues with the heartbreaking story of his own uncle , a congressional medal of honor winner who refused all school scholarships or civilian offers , because--that was his shameful secret-- he too was illiterate . jack concludes with a moving and realistic paean of education . now here s a candidate who knows how to listen , who has sensible ideas , who understands the hurt of others . but hold on ! the uncle yarn will turn out to be pure invention . hold on again ! if quick-change artist stanton can lie like , well , a politician , he can also feel for other people . that s what makes jack such a complex , multi-layered fellow , and that s what the movie captures with amazing accuracy . this goes well beyond the simple jekyll-hyde transformation and into a far more devious and complicated character . jack has the searching eye of a ladies  man eye and a high level of testosterone . in his case as in others , those traits can be inseparable from other talents . it s one big ball of wax . i wager that the name " jack " was chosen to evoke jfk , not only for fast-thinking one one s feet but for sexual shenanigans too . just being next to stanton flusters so much the new york teacher who hosted the meeting that she keeps stumbling on stairs . she later comes out of jack s bedroom , while the governor does not even blink as his helpers , assembled in the hotel suite , watch her exit . nerves of steel ? nerve ? both . the complexity , which extends to most other aspects of the movie , makes " titanic " look like child s play , save for the specials effects . the " pc " director and writer are the once famous cabaret-type duo of nichols and may who , separated for years , were reunited on the stage , then for the film " the birdcage . " both are devilishly talented . i bet they hurried to finish " pc " while the presidential hubbub was at its then-apex . i also bet that they wished the film could have come out in the fall of 1998 , since that s when the likeliest oscar candidates will be released . while at today s date ( late march 1998 ) , " pc " leads the pack by light-years , the memory of voting academy members almost always disfavors pre-summer releases . back to henry , who is inducted in jack s ranks in a whirlwind recruitment . in " pc " we follow everyone , but it is henry whom we watch as the nearly always present thread , and as though he were the chorus of an ancient greek play . it is his actions , observations , reactions and reactions to reactions that make us , the audience , identify with this decent , able and likable young man . henry takes us everywhere , to the mechanisms , agonies and ecstasies of campaigning , including the new hampshire primary that ends with jack in second place ( to general jubilation ) well after the story s mid-point . much , if not most of the plot deals with the staff having to counter rumors , accusations or sometimes deliberate lies , and what seems to be a severe case of satyriasis ( that s the don juan syndrome , the male equivalent of nymphomania ) . among them is a phone call that incriminates jack as he talks sex with a hairdresser deliciously named cashmere mcleod . to the rescue comes gun-toting old pal libby ( kathy bates ) who seems to know everything and everyone and is wise to the age of electronics . more , i cannot divulge . the movie is fast , elliptical , humorous , amusing . it is also raunchy in speech , acts and behavior . as a farce , it is amoral , immoral , cynical and very funny . as an expose of political animals it has wild moments and touching moments . it peeks with savvy into the exhausting process of running for office , the higher the office , the more killing the effort . it pulls no punches , but understands jack stanton , warts and all . there s a magnificent night scene , the culmination of the collaboration between director , writer , set designer and the master cinematographer michael ballhaus . the camera pulls in doughnut-fancier jack sitting across the street in a glassed in a doughnut shop , chatting with true sympathy and empathy with the lone , gimpy employee . it s a rare , quiet interlude , an edward hopper moment of isolation , except that jack s presence promises some hope for the proletarian employee . it is also a moving moment of epiphany for stanton . and it justifies another scene : as billy bob is quitting his job ( he ll come back ) , he takes his leave of henry , asks him to stick with jack . " this one s worth it . " a speech to laid-off workers , from the heart and with no b . s . is as good as anything frank capra ever did , and far more believable . events that involve talk-show hosts larry king , charlie rose , geraldo rivera , bill maher ( as themselves ) , or rob reiner ( as izzy rosenblatt ) , keep hitting the mark . the reiner episode catalyzes changes that will affect jack s rival candidate . this sets in motion a crazy yet believable chain that ends up involving ex-florida governor picker ( larry hagman ) , who is the soul of decency --but has a secret . hagman underacts with admirable control , at the opposite pole of his famous " dallas " performances on tv . which brings me to the performers . they are a superb ( and superbly cast ) cast . as susan stanton , emma thompson has a number of choice scenes with terse and fast dialogue as well as reactions . she is attractive , at times seductive , even sexy . henry is endearing . libby is a great , bossy , volcanic strategist with pit bull determination , yet i have a feeling that her part is a bit overdone , not in acting but in her skills . nor am i too convinced by the final episode that concerns libby . ( no , i won t give it away . this is , after all , also a political thriller ) . then there s travolta , that lazarus of actors who came back from the dead with " pulp fiction . " he does very well , yet if you expect a total impersonation of bill clinton you simply won t get it . you might have , in a stage-play . but in a film , with its merciless close-ups , travolta can only be a semi-clinton . there s common agreement that the real president is as smart as they come , a well-educated thinker-doer . i m not swayed by his rhodes scholarship since many scholars , even famous ones , are really duds . still , the real clinton leaves no doubts about his native intelligence . travolta can be a very fine actor . he gives a striking , cunning performance , but he cannot change his spots . if you don t allow jack his very own personality ; if you concentrate on the clinton/stanton parallels to the detriment of the bigger picture ; if you search for convincing clintonisms , no matter what travolta does , he does not exactly radiate with brains . in any case , directors and witers have to be intelligent , but thespians don t , so long as they have talent . there s no denying that a person with jack s characteristics could be a governor or president . or become a hollywood star .

" ( in germania ) , he whines . " for the glory of rome , " maximus ( crowe ) responds . reflecting on the bloodshed , caesar sighs , " so much for the glory of rome . " this seemingly-innocent mumble has a wonderfully-biting double edge . tired of war , caesar plans to raise his trusted and son-like warrior , maximus , to guardian of a restored republican rome . yet , in all his great wisdom caesar prematurely reveals the plan to his real son , commodus . ( there ll be no rome left for him . ) before maximus is ordained , commodus kills his father and thus becomes a tyrant king . he orders the deaths of maximus and family , then sits back in the throne . maximus narrowly escapes , but is captured ( as a slave ) by a circus leader who runs a traveling gladiator show . coincidentally , commodus decides to reinstate the game in rome , thus the mighty maximus arrives back in the capital harboring a festering vendetta . it s a great story , celebrated warrior turned slave , turned gladiator , turned revolutionist . and crowe is steadfast . but here are the problems : his son and daughter look like models in an aspirin commercial . they have no lines . they re displayed either as utopian or crispy dead - never real . so we feel nothing for them and when they re slain , we don t care . better to leave them unshown . crowe is a great actor , let his love for them be enough to make us care . this is a long film , cut out their segments entirely . conveying them only as ideas , the film would be stronger . i have great faith in crowe s ability to make us long for that family with him . unspecified , we can fill in the blanks with our own warm feelings of home . the two other problems involve the beginning and the ending . i just don t believe that a great wise leader would have so immaturely handled such a delicate situation as depriving the thrown from his immoral son . caesar would have ordered his son commodus off on some important mission in some distant land or other , while maximus was ordained . either that , or ( dare you scheme with me ) caesar may have wanted the son to murder him , thus inspiring maximus all the more - but if the writers intended this twist they certainly did not clearly lay it out . such a strategy would have improved the film and my ability to " buy in " earlier on . but weather you " buy in " or not , it s still a fun story . powerful underdog , rising from the slime and under-appreciated to challenge the all mighty czar . and there s all that blood and guts in the arena . the very first fight ( meant to establish crowe as a fighting man s general of war ) begins with nightsky-scraping flaming arrows that dash across in the twilight emitting a magically-lethal orange glow . i thought to myself , " this is one medieval battlefield rumble to end all cinema recreations . " as the conflict rages , the camera angles become increasingly narrowed and the screen full of flames and blurred soldiers in slow mo . but the effect becomes over-digitized in a strobe reminiscent of a consumer camera , subtracting from the realism and gravity of the fight . and instead of continuing the ever-tightening angle to personalize the savagery , a few mid-wide shots are tossed in . it breaks up the direction of the sequence and wakes the viewer from its hypnotic effect . still a strong sequence overall , but " the messenger " did a better job . lastly , this is an action film and not-disappointingly it ends with action . unfortunately , a few additional lines of dialogue are tacked on , again diluting the power of the event . nothing needed to be said !

" the boxer " of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day-lewis ) , an ex-ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over . first off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub-leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail . while this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle s " shallow grave " ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together . danny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again . and danny runs into his ex-love , maggie ( " breaking the waves "  s emily watson ) , who hasn t seen him since he went in . they don t easily start up their romance again because she s the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny s tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon . but the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things . the political story is nothing really special but works in itself . we ve seen it many a time before , but it s at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times . there s a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty . the boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship . there are only a few boxing scenes , but they re never like " raging bull " /let s-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones brilliant . they re more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times . and i didn t know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape . but the backbone of the story is the love one . because these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight . as the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters . this is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood . these elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand-in-hand with eachother . i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next . it made sure that we didn t just care for one of them . i m not saying they re all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively . the acting is amazing , with day-lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry . i m not sure if they re oscar-nominee bound , but they re very good . in the supporting roles , billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers . but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike , who is just a great scene stealer . the direction and co-writing by jim sheridan ( with the other co-writing credit going to terry george ) is excellent , rounding out the characters well , but not pacing everything greatly . i noticed that the first half was very leisurely ( yet fascinating ) , but the second half whirls by at a quick pace , and ends much too quickly . more time could have been spent thinking up the ending , since it does seem quite sloppy . though " the boxer " is a good film , it never achieves the greatness that it should . sure , it s a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it s own , it just could have been better . but it still works out , gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama , and features great acting . even if it could have been better , this ll do .

positiveC,' review by lars lindahl ( larsattacks@mail . com ) starring matthew mcconaughey , harvey keitel , jon bon jovi , bill paxton , erik palladino , tom guiry , t . c . carson , david keith , jake weber , jack noseworthy , matthew settle , will estes , and dave power . i had lost all faith in pg-13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults . the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete , as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating . however , after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u-571 , my bias is beginning to go away . both films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers . even better , i didn t think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts . everyone loves surprises . u-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets . this may be true , but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director/co-writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal ; to blow the audience s socks off . set during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u-boats , u-571 follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship . there s only one problem : the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as ( you guessed it ) u-571 . it is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors , led by an interim captain named tyler ( matthew mcconaughey ) , to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships . the film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors ( most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear ) . once the crew gets on the u-boat , the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down . as soon as the action starts , it does not stop and luckily , because it is so exciting , i didn t want it to stop . this is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises , from the wonderful , heart-pounding score to the constant yelling of panicking men , make sure you see this at a theater with surround-soundotherwise , do not see it all . the best parts of u-571 are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations . throughout the movie , several morals or characters are introduced to make tyler s job as stressful as possible . germans gun down their own men , tyler s mentor captain dahlgren warns him that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even the most beloved soldiers for a victory , another sailor ( erik palladino ) threatens mutiny . all of these examples , and several others , increase the chaotic atmosphere and the importance of tyler s every move . they also make u-571 one of the most exhilarating movies i have seen in a while .

positiveC,' mighty joe young ( pg ) . ( walt disney pictures/rko/buena vista international ) director : ron underwood stars : bill paxton , charlize theron , rade serbedzija , peter firth , david paymer , regina king , naveen andrews , lawrence pressman , linda purl . the original mighty joe young , produced in 1949 , was politely regarded as something of a distant cousin to king kong . this entertaining and environmentally friendly $49 million disney remake softens the action to make the movie more palatable for family audiences , while retaining something of a deliberately old fashioned flavour . for those interested in useless trivia , the original mighty joe young is the only movie to have been directed by a legally blind person . director ernest b schoedsack lost his sight during w . w . ii , and could only see blurred movement . an assistant director told him what was happening on the set . taking advantage of more sophisticated technology , director ron underwood ( tremors , etc ) also improves upon the original , even though it ultimately ends up being something of a lukewarm cross between gorillas in the mist and king kong . oscar winning effects designer rick baker ( incidentally , the man inside the gorilla suit in john guillerman s 1976 remake of king kong ) has created a life-like and realistic gorilla who interacts beautifully with his human co-stars . joe , the 20 foot gorilla , is portrayed here as quite loveable , and ensures that audience sympathy is with him all the way . the climax , in which joe rescues a young boy trapped on a blazing ferris wheel , is awash in mawkish sentimentality , and threatens to unbalance the movie . jill young ( charlize theron , from the devil s advocate , etc ) has grown up as a wild child of the jungle . she and the gorilla joe share a life shaped by tragedy . twelve years earlier they both lost their mothers to the villainous poacher strasser ( rade serbedzija , from the saint , etc ) . ever since , jill has protected joe from the dangers represented by man , hiding him away from the rapidly encroaching modern world . one day he is discovered by gregg o hara ( bill paxton , from titanic , etc ) , a scientist who traps animals for a nature conservatory in los angeles . o hara eventually convinces jill that the safest place for joe is in the preserve , where he will be protected from poachers . joe initially reacts badly to being displaced from his jungle home , but soon settles down as jill watches over him . all goes well , and joe becomes the conservatory s biggest attraction . then strasser returns to resolve unfinished business . joe escapes strasser s clutches , and runs amok through the streets of la , climbing over familiar landmarks such as mann s chinese theatre and the hollywood sign . there is plenty of action as joe is pursued through the streets and sewers of la by helicopters . these sequences are more genuinely exciting that the recent godzilla , in which much of the action was murkily shot . the computer generated special effects are superb , although they do not detract from the more human elements of the story . younger audiences may find themselves a little bored with the developing romance between o hara and jill , and the pace is a little slow until joe escapes into la . characterisation is pretty one dimensional , although the performances overcome many of the limitations of the formulaic and predictable script . an always likeable and solid actor , paxton brings plenty of charm and sincerity to his role here . special effects creator ray harryhausen , who designed the oscar winning stop motion effects for the original , and actress terry moore , who starred in the 1949 version , both contribute brief cameos here . this modern reworking of mighty joe young is quite an exciting and entertaining adventure , ideal family viewing for the holiday season .

" cookie did not commit suicide , " camille assures her . " only crazy folks commit suicide . " camille , for reasons unknown to anyone except for her , wants to prove that her family isn t crazy , so she tries to pass off cookie s suicide as a murder . she goes through all the steps trying to make it seem like a murder , and then calls the cops . meanwhile , cora s delinquent daughter , emma ( liv tyler ) , is back in town . when the police suspect willis of commiting the crime , and lock him up , she decides to become her cellmate . infact , the jail cell is basically an open room where the cops come in and play scrabble and talk about fishing with the criminals . one of the cops is jason , a very dumb young man who is in love with emma . jason is excited to be coping with the town s first real crime , and camille is trying to cover it up right in front of him . cookie s fortune isn t one of altman s more important films , but it is still a cut above most dark comedies . unlike many directors , altman isn t trying to show off any derivative new style . he just wants the viewer to see the characters in their real life form , which makes the film all the more convincing . i m surprised to see that the film recieved somewhat lukewarm reception at sundance . perhaps the viewers were hoping for something different . but i , for one , loved this entertaining gem . infact i may have even enjoyed it better than altman s last outing , the john grisham s scripted the gingerbread man , which was also a very good picture . cookie s fortune is a breath of fresh air from other derivative movies made by twentysomething film students . it shows patient , developed filmmaking from a truly knowledgable filmmaker . cookie s fortune is one of the new year s smartest comedies . a review by akiva gottlieb , the teenage movie critic akiva@excite . com http : //www . angelfire . com/mo/film watch me on tbs  " dinner and a movie " may 21 , 8 : 05pm est get your free , private email at http : //mail . excite . com/ '

" brrrrrrrrr . . . now what was that sound in the basement ? honey , can you go check ? " and one thing this film doesn t have , unlike its hollywood-ian counterparts like the haunting , is special effects . in fact , that s one of the greater things about this movie : it feels real because it looks like it s actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances ( i did some research and it was , in fact , shot on digital video . . . ah-ha ! ) . another great thing about it is that it s actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme , and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen ( it s mostly implied , kids ! ) . and as clichéd as it might be to say . . . it s usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such . other films that this one reminded me of include henry : portrait of a serial killer and the blair witch project , with that same real sense of dread , brooding and terror . the film does however move awfully slow and if you really don t get " into " it completely ( you really need to concentrate here ) , you will lose the motion of the story and the pent-up tension might be released . but overall , this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight . and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can , how can you go wrong ? definitely not a film for everyone but a must-see for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed ( count me in ! ) . stanley kubrick would be proud ! oh yeah . . . so where s that gun again . . . ? where s joblo coming from ? the blair witch project ( 4/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the haunting ( 3/10 ) - the house on haunted hill ( 7/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - the pledge ( 6/10 ) - the shining ( 9/10 ) - the sixth sense ( 8/10 ) - unbreakable ( 8/10 ) '

( why the u . s . is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . ) their plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within . the head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) . his group of men is a colorful bunch , including a . j . ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) . there s also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry s daughter . a . j . and grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn t too happy with the situation . it s absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you d like to call armageddon . it s not about story -- it s about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff . it s incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds  thought to what actually happens . but bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better . i think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles . take the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york . a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars . the action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways . i like his quick-edit style , because it s abrasive and exhausting to watch . it s also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times . but it s fun to be obnoxious sometimes . the special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame . deep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable . special effects are very important in a film like this : if they re not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn t work . everything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid . the effects that don t look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art . of course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn t get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action . the film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action . much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters  subplots . i won t suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren t put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way . in fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that s a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story . bruce willis is terrific , and i m glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) . tyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level . patton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving . the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny . i wasn t challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don t mind too much . but the film doesn t insult my intelligence -- it s pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do . it s not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema . it might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget . i m not saying that films like this are risky moves . what i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms .

" you do like risks , don t you , mr . barber ? " rhea alluringly coos . boys , form a line behind me . part of " palmetto "  s success can be attributed to the performance of elisabeth shue , who demonstrates here that her oscar-nominated turn in " leaving las vegas " might merely be foreshadowing great things to come . shue s a seductive , campy delight , and pulls off a barbara stanwyck-gloria swanson combo with admirable relish . the other actors form a solid ensemble around her , including sevigny ( " kids " ) , tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease , as well as the ever-likeable gershon , cast a far cry from her extreme roles in " bound " and " showgirls . " harrelson is still doing fine follow-up work to " the people vs . larry flynt . " " palmetto " does have its share of grievances . harrelson s narration is needless , i suppose , and gershon s nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is . one of the plot s unexpected angles -- that harry is asked by the police to become the press liaison for the very crime in which he s involved -- could have been played a little better . there are moments when you question the tone , but it s never so unstable that it deserves the reproach it s been receiving from most other critics . if " palmetto " didn t want to be laughed at , would it really have tacked on a climax that plays like a live-action " who framed roger rabbit " ? although a few elements can be questioned , the movie works well on its own terms . thanks to a juicy cast -- especially shue -- and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff ( you remember him from last summer s suddenly re-popular " the tin drum , " right ? ) , everything runs smoothly . and for fans of revelation-heavy endings , this film s got a few shocks in store that i won t even dream of revealing .

positiveC,' it is with hesitance that i call " apocalypse now " a masterpiece . certainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970 s . the plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad s " heart of darkness " , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war . " apocalypse " certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history . the plot is fairly simple . captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty . his mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) " with extreme prejudice " . along the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt . col . kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies . willard  s four person crew finally make it to kurtz  compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives . willard s experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending . the movie is visually breathtaking . the battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate . the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening . the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie . the journey to kurtz  camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character . the most interesting one is kilgore , the lt . col . who cares more about the surf than about the mission . it is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie . the scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne . the narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz . coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like " saving private ryan " on lsd . the film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution . the problems come when the film slows down . one of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess . the dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film . the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound . the film slows down to a drag . sheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received . brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic . the scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief . sheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told . the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations . granted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion . brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ? there are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene . there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending . the finest scene at the end is sheen s escape , and his entrace into the temple . his rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film . yet , you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done . the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good . it is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man s mental stamina during bouts of war . but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful , had the character of kurtz been more explored , and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for . there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece , but it could have been so much more rewarding .

positiveC,' one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids . although black-and-white films are frequently viewed as suspect , ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind . and if you can find a colorful action film , even if it is from six decades ago , then there is a real possibility of a take home hit . so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood , a high spirited version of the walter scott story . nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold s melodramatic music , ralph dawson s fast paced editing and carl jules weyl s lush sets , the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn s charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley , a . k . a . robin hood . flynn , with his handsome figure and toothy smile , charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself . let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household . the littlest rhodes , jeffrey , age 8 , liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more . i ll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review . simply stated , the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre , the swashbuckler . robin , with a smile from ear-to-ear , fights off a hundred men without a scratch . although the picture can be considered as little more than a 1930 s james bond , the production values and the acting raise it above that level . robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor . robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows . in this movie , however , he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country . robin , with his courage and athletic skills , serves as a role model for kids . and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy-eyed lady marian fitzswalter , the story has heavy romantic overtones . filmed in the typical , richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor , the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties , which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players . in scene after scene the picture charms the audience . who wouldn t fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest , even if the outcome is so clearly preordained . and , of course , he doesn t just win , he does so by splitting the other man s arrow . watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments . sherlock holmes as the villain , sir guy of gisbourne , for example , just doesn t seem right , even if basil rathbone did have a real-life identity outside of his most famous role . and then there are those wigs from the makeup department -- so bad , they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy . as was popular in the cinema of that era , people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty , bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks . bad guys are banished rather than killed , and lovers go off hand-in-hand , doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing . the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful , cartoonish figures . hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore , so try to savor the old ones when you can . the adventures of robin hood runs 1 : 42 . it is not rated , but containing absolutely nothing offensive , it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages . jeffrey thinks the film is " great " and gives it . he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures -- he hates the sight of blood in movies . his favorite parts are the battles and the ending , and his favorite characters are robin and king richard ( ian hunter ) .
