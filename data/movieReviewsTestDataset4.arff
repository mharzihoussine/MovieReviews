negativeC,' the happy bastard s quick movie review  damn that y2k bug .  it s got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on .  little do they know the power within . . .  going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance .  we don t know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don t know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don t know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout .  here , it s just " hey , let s chase these people around with some robots " .  the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis .  you re more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 .  sutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he s acting like a baldwin , of course .  the real star here are stan winston s robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone s brain .  so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here s your movie .  otherwise , it s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie .

negativeC,' it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch .  based on the late 1960 s television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover .  however , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion .  of course , the ads make it seem like so much more .  quick cuts , cool music , claire dane s nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like .  sounds like a cool movie , does it not ?  after the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not .  the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn t enough .  the film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half .  and with it comes every single clich ? .  it doesn t really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we ve already seen .  the characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden .  claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience .  the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching .  unfortunately , even he s not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don t do much apart from occupying screen time .  with the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset .  despite an american  r  rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset .  information on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable .  the way the film progresses , you likely won t even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you ll know they aren t .  basing the show on a 1960 s television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that s missing a finger or two ) .  the number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them .  it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we ve been seeing as of late .  avoid this film at all costs .

negativeC,'  " quest for camelot " is warner bros .   first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney s cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried .  the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall s promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production " anastasia , " but disney s " hercules , " with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997 s best piece of animation .  this year , it s no contest , as " quest for camelot " is pretty much dead on arrival .  even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that d be " pocahontas " for those of you keeping score -- isn t nearly as dull as this .  the story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur s round table .  kayley s only dream is to follow in her father s footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur s magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest .  with the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that s always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur s side .   " quest for camelot " is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it s ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney .  there s nothing here that differentiates " quest " from something you d see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage .   ( compare kayley and garrett s run-in with the angry ogre to herc s battle with the hydra .  i rest my case . )  even the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others .  in the end , it s a tie -- they all win .  that dragon s comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse .  at least fans of the early- 90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel " urkel " white and bronson " balki " pinchot sharing the same footage .  a few scenes are nicely realized ( though i m at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don t sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) .  but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good .  aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , " quest for camelot "  s most grievous error is its complete lack of personality .  and personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way .

negativeC,' synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy s mother , a fledgling restauranteur .  unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman s favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way .  comments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video .  their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they re typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) .  stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he s rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) .  other than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable .  stalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do .  interspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen .  after these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears .  the narrator states that " this is the story of daryl gleason " and tells the audience that he is the stalker .  of course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels .  if the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked .  okay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required .  stalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious .  the opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together .  daryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her .  ultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate .  these plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet .  for some reason , this genre s films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked .  stalked is no exception ( it s a cat this time -- found in the shower ) .  events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you ll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) .  stalked s cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either .  jay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much .  he overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands .  maryam d abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the " stalked " of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner .  brooke ( d abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed .  toward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl .  to ensure he won t use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house .  does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ?  of course not .  she tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house .  when daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger .  somehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside .  the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience s suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character s intelligence .  stalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched .  rated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are .  if you re in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else .

negativeC,' capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace .  there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise .  john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself .   , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) .  john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes .  for a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make .  ghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace .  in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue .  this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness .  it is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way .  but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience .  ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 .  mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film s budget ) .  it is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film .  society has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little .  apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control .  and from carpenter s view , women have really made a mess of things .  society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten .  the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony .  instead of having the criminal " napolean " wilson , this film has the criminal " desolation " williams .  instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars .  because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination .  the story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback .  ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black .  carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat .  sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup .  the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss .  his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring .  these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience .  somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights .  within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars .  after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by .  i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  following the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter s classic assault on precinct 13 .  her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice .

negativeC,' so ask yourself what " 8mm " ( " eight millimeter " ) is really all about .  is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ?  is it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there s a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won t necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ?  or is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ?  i m not talking about snuff films , supposed " documentaries " of victims being brutalized and killed on camera .  i m talking about films like " 8mm " and its director , joel schumacher .  with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- " batman & robin , " " a time to kill , " " batman forever , " " the client " --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence .  is " 8mm " something you really want to see ?  probably not .  the first two-thirds of " 8mm " unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core .  then , as it s been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence .  and just when you think it s finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further .  trust me .  there are better ways to waste two hours of your life .  nicolas   " snake eyes "   cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband s safe documents a young girl s murder .  welles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don t need any specialized skills or training to do this .  welles certainly makes it look easy .  and cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues .  the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader s " hardcore . "  occasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task .  there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa .   " 8mm " doesn t condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it .  the irony , of course , is that schumacher and " seven " scribe andrew kevin walker s vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product .  so we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror .  later it s the turn of joaquin phoenix ( who s quite good and by far the film s most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again .  all this to get to the familiar yet offensive " revelation " that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me .  neither super nor standard , " 8mm " is shocking only in its banality .

negativeC,' that s exactly how long the movie felt to me .  there weren t even nine laughs in nine months .  it s a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork .  it s not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it s the fact that grant is annoying .  not just adam sandler-annoying , we re talking jim carrey-annoying .  since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ?  but , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant s head in joan cusack s lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant s pregnant girlfriend she has " a big pussy , " referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ?  nine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot .  hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist .  why a child psychologist ?  so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange :  kid : my dad s an asshole .  grant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ?  kid : my dad s a _huge_ asshole .  more like a hugh asshole , but that s beside the point , which is : nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief .  so , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) .  this paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grant s equally annoying friend s wife is also pregnant .  the annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed " arnie the dinosaur " ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store .  the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment .  not even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor .  his is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ?  that s my favorite vodka , by the way ) , hence the line " now it s time to take a look at your volvo , " another nasty but unamusing joke , except this one goes right over the ten year olds  heads , while the adults simultaneously groan .  nine months is a complete failure , low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick , failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy .  hugh grant s sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters , but they certainly won t leave with a smile on their faces , not after 90 minutes of grant s nervous smiles .  everything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic that anyone with an i . q .  over 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire .  but at least they didn t spend 60 bucks for it .

negativeC,' call it a road trip for the walking wounded .  stellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it s difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence .  yet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama .  playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late .  that s an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) .  they haven t spoken in years , and wouldn t even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren t for kaisa s mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer .  in a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live .   ( only in the movies , right ? )  too blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa .  loathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be .  despite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn t fallen very far from the tree .  kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper .  ain t they a pair ?  unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative .  by the time they reach the hospital , it s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe .  this revelation exists purely for its own sake .  aberdeen doesn t know where else to go .  weak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa .  if lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) .  headey s too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance .  if she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more .  it s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter s captivating signs & wonders .  it s not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) .  the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant .  in aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed .  despite skarsg ? rd s solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow .  there s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity .  nossiter s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain .  if signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it s willing to stretch beyond what we ve come to expect from traditional drama .  aberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies .  when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ?  the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan s trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin s hollywood mogul pronounces , " all of life s riddles are answered in the movies ! "  even foreign films are taking that advice to heart . '

negativeC,' best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann s forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on .  usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he s only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do .  if you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach s hidden agenda .  cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge .  big john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad .  what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light .  he s an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids  problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . )  he ll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world .  l . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia .  filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) .  in his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e .  highway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 .  he s both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn t want to do .  this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he s a beast , but ashamed of it . )  l . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie s ill-advised foray into big john s haven .  there is unnecessary padding with howie s miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger .  rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length .  concurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted .  cox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster .  dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent .  we re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it s surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene .  the restraint is admirable .  but l . i . e .  s screenplay doesn t always give them the best material .  when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious .  director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach s goldberg variations .  it s too much .  there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john s other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie .  this plot thread predictably leads to violence .  not content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff s superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note .  it s typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note .  in this regard , l . i . e .   ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed .  how often does real life work this way ?  to extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ?

negativeC,' janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker .  this is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs .  it also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too .  garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection .  denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that s made the kennedy family so popular .  so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit .  she soon learns why " easier said than done " is the mantra of movies like this .  the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can t get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on .  then comes what roger ebert calls the " meet cute . "  it happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way .  in the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side .  no points for guessing it s the same dog that just made water on her luggage .  also no points for guessing garofalo hates o hara on sight .  that s how it works in movies like these .  i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she d hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they d reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits .  i haven t mentioned the movie s twist yet .  garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss .  milo o shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together .  rest assured he ll do all he can to match up garofalo and o hara .  oh , and in keeping with the matchmaker s utter predictability , he dies toward the end .  what the message here ?  sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script .  i was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together .  leary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole .  he even undoes himself with the old microphone s still on after he s done giving the speech cliche .  both of them should have known better .

negativeC,' and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn t pretty .  this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas s the three musketeers .  by bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting .  the end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu .  the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay .  d artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer .  he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents .  in paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu s man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks .  he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer s wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king s prison .  d artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d artagnan leading the charge , and save the day .  director peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it s a disaster .  one problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones .  jet li s high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around .  ironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes .  most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture .  the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader .  chambers  d artangnan isn t a musketeer -- he s a mouseketeer !  and hyam s use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that s the only standout in an overall flat production . '
negativeC,' a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels .  first , there s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie .  but occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery .  no no . . .  just kidding .  had you going there for a moment , didn t i ?  in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games .  the first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it s 5 billion inhabitants ) .  the mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth .  unfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance .  the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game .  i d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie .  the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn t try to overachieve .  there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot .  and , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office .  mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie .  shao khan has decided that he s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament .  thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid .  one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought " hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . "  too bad they didn t simply stick with the formula from the first movie .  i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points :   * the acting is truly bad .  sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) .   * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder .  in the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics .  i generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim " tiny " lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite " utility " actors but he s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness .   * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again .   * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) .  for these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . .   . . . unless you re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie .  in that case , the following critiques also apply :   * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter .  wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer .  hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene .   * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) .  sonya does her " kiss of death , " jax does his " earthquake , " liu kang does his " animality , " and so on .  a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely .   * there aren t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between .  silly , silly folks .  and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match .  lame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it .   * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their " animalities . "  motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie .  for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 .  you ll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one .

negativeC,' she was the femme in " la femme nikita . "  he was the baldwin in " backdraft , " " sliver , " and " fair game " ( with cindy crawford ) .  together , anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make " shattered image " the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone/stone " thriller " " the specialist . "  the film poses the question " what if the life you re living now is really a dream , and your dreams reality ? "  it s either about a woman who s haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she s a hired assassin , or it s about a hired assassin who s haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she s honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica .  it doesn t much matter and believe me by the time " shattered image " runs its painful and pedestrian course you won t care .  these two lives , with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eyes , and black leather clothing in the seattle-based assassin scenes , and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes , play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it s now * twice * as boring as it might have been .  it s not that complicated plots can t be entertaining .  of course it helps if you have interesting characters , crisp dialogue , and a modicum of style .   " shattered image " isn t complex , it s just stupid .  and boring .  parillaud and baldwin , who aren t exactly shakespearean material to begin with , are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines .  lines like :   " you don t beg , you insist .  i like that in a woman . "  that s parillaud s character talking . . .  to her cat !  and :   " you re not the reason i couldn t care less about you . "  huh ?  and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film :   " if you give me a couple of minutes you know i ll charm the pants off you . "   " i don t have that kind of time . "  talking of pants , parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say " point of no return . "  we have come to expect this from billy baldwin , but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first .  but there s nothing to learn .  karen is as interesting as a cereal box , a someone s-out-to-get-me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone , the stranger who sends her flowers , maybe even her husband himself , is her would-be killer .  siouxsie is the chromium cool , tough-as-nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the film s meaningless stock title .  baldwin seems more interested in parillaud s nest egg ( so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot ) than he does in her .  each time graham greene shows up he gets killed .  barbet schroeder ( " reversal of fortune " ) co-produced and should be ashamed of himself .  every now and again it s fun to watch a really bad movie .  and every now and again , as " shattered image " makes agonizingly clear , it isn t .

negativeC,' john carpenter makes b-movies .  always has ( " halloween , " " escape from new york , " " the thing " ) and , by the looks of it ( " they live , " " escape from l . a . , " " vampires " ) , always will .  carpenter s latest horror opus with a science fiction bent ( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent ) is the aptly-titled " john carpenter s ghosts of mars " ( in case , i suppose , you went looking for someone else s " ghosts of mars " ) .  like all those films prefixed by the very possessive " john carpenter s , " " ghosts of mars " is an unashamed b-movie punctuated by a b-movie plot , b-movie actors , and b-movie special effects .  in category one , above , we have a storyline that borders on idiotic ( and , at times , chaotic ) .  dormant martians ( i . e . , swirling red gases ) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes .  all this explained ( in flashback ) to some grand pooh-bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard ( natasha henstridge , from the sub- " species " films ) , the only returnee on a silly-looking train .  officer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james " desolation " williams ; what she found was not a pretty picture .  in the second category we have ms . henstridge , her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail , ice cube ( as the appropriately-named " desolation " ) , pam grier ( briefly , oddly--who wanted to work with whom i wonder ? ) , and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didn t need to try too hard .  in category number three we have , in addition to those swirling red gases and the silly-looking train , a couple of bird s-eye-view shots of a sprawling martian metropolis ( reddish also ) .  state-of-the-art special effects have never been a carpenter trademark and once again the writer/director ( who seems to have no problem finding work , however ) doesn t waste any of the film s budget in that department .   " ghosts of mars " is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry .  the film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly .  carpenter might like to think he s made a western here but it s a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts .  it s just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken .  i never thought i d miss the guy but i do .  it s not * all * the same , however .  dubbed the " one-note wonder " for his minimalist music soundtracks , carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic ( yet effective ) scoring by highlighting his action with loud , screeching guitar work .  fortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue .  the final exchange between henstridge and , er , cube though is both audible * and * priceless .  mars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn " mission to mars " and " red planet " ( with val kilmer ) .   " ghosts of mars " sadly adds to those disappointing returns ( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels , among them " american pie 2 " and " rush hour 2 " ) .  the irony is that the mars in carpenter s film feels sadly absent .  there are occasional references to the red planet , of course , but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth s closest neighbor .  two things keep " john carpenter s ghosts of mars " from getting a huge slap upside the head .  1 .  henstridge keeps her top on ( miraculously ) , and 2 . the film doesn t pretend to be anything it s not .  what that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly out of luck .

negativeC,' i m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone .  sure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god s green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out .  the crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff .  hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in .  clueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time .  and people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i m the only one who doesn t like it .  one girl said if i d seen the movie with " an open mind , " i would have enjoyed it .  nothing could be further from the truth .  i went into the theater expecting to love the movie .  the preview looked good and of course i m crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters .  almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way .  when we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn t me ) yelled out , " that was the worst f$&#in  movie i ve ever seen " and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement .  so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia s pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter .  i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway .  what i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever .  and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like .  where to begin in criticizing this movie ?  the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever .  there is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence .  zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero .  so why does this movie get one star out of me ?  well , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub .  and if it wasn t bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get .  alicia plays a babysitter who s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party .  and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) .  as the movie trods along , we discover she s not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character s fantasies ( and probably every male viewer s too ) .  the drunken father thinks she s just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she s taking her bubble bath .  they even throw in the middle aged wife s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party .  not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy .  at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated .  in fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there s absolutely no nudity in it .  so you can t call it a sex flick .  i ve already pointed out that it can t fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ?  bad .

negativeC,' so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ?  well , whatever it is , you d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we re left with here .  this is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing !  it s like i said . . . this  movie sucks .  plot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet .  critique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie .  uneven , would be another .  the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it s actually going to go " somewhere " .  but it isn t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the " pain " of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix .  in a sci-fi movie ?  well , i don t know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement .  ultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their " misadventures in space " for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact .  mind you , if you enjoyed that film s shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well .  of course , i don t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story .  ugh .  what a friggin  mess .  films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again .  didn t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ?  didn t they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain t saying much ! ) .  of course , you can t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o connell in this fine crew of thespians .   nuff said .  neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film s musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my  ears hurt ! ) .  so is anything salvageable in this movie ?  sure .  gary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the " sand-twister " effect that you see in the commercial is well done .  other than that ?  i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops ,  did i say " admire " , i meant " am disgusted " !  all in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it s just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck .  go see the ninth gate . . . now  there s a great movie !  and on a personal note , i think it s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting .

negativeC,' the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film s end .  if you re not familiar with this law , then maybe you ve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film s end .  now if you re a regular reader of mine , you ve heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ?  no , it definitely is not .  melissa joan hart ( from abc s " sabrina , the teenage witch " ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team .  adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who s just broken up with his activist girlfriend .  apparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back , and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance .  so the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud .  will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ?  will this crazy scheme work ?  do i care ?  the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy .  what makes movies like can t hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she s all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly .  i don t know what the writer s intention was with drive me crazy .  there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to .  here there s nothing . . .  just teens whining about who s going to take them to the big dance .  do me a favor kids , go get a job or something . . .  just shut the hell up .  in all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits .  now normally when i say that it s followed with the joke " . . . because the movie is finally over .

"  joe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla .  he runs around the fields , chasing cars and people .  he picks things up and stares at them pensively .  he breaks things on accident , because he s just too big to avoid clumsiness .  joe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes .  as a character , he doesn t quite register .  and the story he s been put in is as limp as they come .  the words " family entertainment " have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart .  the picture is a remake of the 1949 film .  it s mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters .  the main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas .  as a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife .  specifically , she s out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood .  soon , zoologist gregg o hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill s mother .  so , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers .  in addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) .  and , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill s mother .  jill , of course , doesn t recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother .  this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film .  the movie isn t really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla .  but the story is really dumb , there aren t any characters , and the film isn t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals .  the movie also has bad dialogue .  if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it s only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like " joe isn t happy ! "  and " joe isn t safe here ! "   " we need to get joe out of here ! "   " joe is way too big for that cage ! "  i don t know if these phrases are word for word , but they re close .  as i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) .  paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them .  sadly , mighty joe young wastes them both .  there are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes .  it s certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares .  but adults in the audience aren t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla .  a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla .  nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla .

negativeC,'  " spawn " features good guys , bad guys , lots of fighting , bloody violence , a leather-clad machine gun chick , gooey , self-healing bullet holes , scatological humor and a man-eating monster .  it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year-old boys , it appears to have been made by them .  in a classic example of telling and not showing , " spawn " opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness , forces of light and how " men are the ones who create evil on earth . "  so much for a message .  the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government assassin/operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant .  simmons goes to hell and back , after making a deal with satan himself -- if he agrees to command the devil s army to overtake the world , he ll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda ( underused theresa randle ) and little girl cyan ( sydni beaudoin ) .  of course , seeing as how five years has passed , wanda has fallen for -- and married -- simmons  partner ( d . b .  sweeney ) .  his , uh , shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown ( john leguizamo ) , a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan s .  clown manipulates simmons , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn .  wynn , who thinks he is in league with the double-dealing clown , recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart -- when it stops beating , major cities around the world will detonate , causing the leak of a disease that " makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash . "  phew . got all that ?  it would be easy to dismiss " spawn " as just another one of those heavy-on-fx , short-on-substance action pics , but it doesn t even work on that level .  the computer-generated sequences are often and plenty , and the problem is that they look too computer-generated .  the several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic -- with the movie s healthy budget you d think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks .  other elements of the movie are so-so ; spawn s enormous red , flowing cape is a wonderful sight , but it s too obvious when he s being played by a costumed actor or an image .  in movies like " contact , " the special effects serve the story .  in " spawn , " they are the story .  and spawn himself isn t even an interesting character .  the film s reliance on razzle-dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for , but both simmons and his funky alter-ego are completely underdeveloped .  what we need is a batman , a luke skywalker .  even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn .  poor leguizamo .  he starred in february s " the pest , " a movie that i still think is the year s worst so far , although this one does give it a run for its money .  as clown , he overacts to the extreme , never missing an opportunity for a poor-taste punchline .  leguizamo farts green mist , munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a mini-skirt and performs a cheerleader routine , all before turning into a giant grey demon .  the guy was brilliant in " to wong foo , thanks for everything !  julie newmar . "  what is he doing wasting his talent in this and " the pest " ?  i m one of the few people that liked " batman & robin , " this summer s other big-budget comic book film .  yet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison , i can only hope people will change their minds and think of " batman " as the superior adaptation .  there s a compelling story somewhere in " spawn " -- including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first african-american superhero ever -- but it s just not found anywhere near here .  as it is , " spawn " is just awful -- it stinks worse than a dead trout . '
negativeC,'  " in dreams " might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths .  no , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie s brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards .  the big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind " the crying game . "  he s no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope .  things start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji s stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat .  this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there s even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn t deserve so good a polish , it s this one .  don t knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue .  annette bening , another asset " in dreams " shouldn t be so lucky to boast , gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn t do much for her in return .  she plays claire cooper , a massachusetts children s book illustrator who s plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children .  she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible , soon-to-be-committed crimes , but neither her ho-hum husband ( aidan quinn ) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously .  this being a thriller , we know that she is , in fact , on the money , and it s a credit to bening s acting that she delves equally into claire s madness and compassion .  but as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims , " in dreams " trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense .  scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition .  subplots appear and disappear .  when claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer ( robert downey jr . ) , it turns out his name is vivian , he s clairvoyant and he s got some major issues with mama , a la norman bates .   " in dreams " reaches its absurdist zenith here , and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists .  some questions , then : what s with the garbage disposal retching applesauce ?  are the drawings on the wall blood or paint ?  who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own ?  what about the computer ?  does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers ?  why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan ?  is the woman in australia integral to anything ?  and the aforementioned flooded city - what function does that _really_ serve ?  sigh .  at least in my own dreams , i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn t go to waste . '
negativeC,'  " knock off " is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie .  it s also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year .  i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found .  jean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods .  rob schneider plays van damme s partner , and rochon plays . . .  actually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be .  she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there .  many things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick .  where chan comes off as endearing in his " normal guy " character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp .  we re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions .  to be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear .  the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong .  tsui hark ( who directed van damme s last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , " double team " ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that s no exaggeration .  we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme s foot entering a shoe .  fabulous !  seriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don t get carried away .  for example , look at sam raimi .   " army of darkness " , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story .  that s a concept that tsui can t seem to grasp .  the special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * " knock off " to the point where the audience doesn t have a clue as to what s happening any more .  another problem with the film is that it looks cheap .  the film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night .  and for some inexplicable reason , everyone s voice seems to have been dubbed .  even the stars .  and even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent .  for example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window .  the car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed .  seconds later , the car drives off at full speed .  hey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere .  finally , the acting .  nobody gives a good performance in this film .  van damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing " everyman " .  and schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene .  even the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as . . .  once again , i have no idea who he was supposed to be .  in case i haven t yet made it clear enough , " knock off " is the worst movie of van damme s career and possibly the worst movie of the decade .  and it s not even one of those movies that s so bad it s funny .  it s too inept to be funny .  there are no redeeming factors in " knock off " and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased . '
negativeC,'  " snake eyes " is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing .  it s not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he s a great director and one who s films are always greeted with at least some fanfare .  and it s not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents .  it s worse than that .  it s aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness .  or more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness .  in certain circles , " snake eyes " was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa s classic " rashomon , " where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb .  in one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who s character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who s also in this ) , and watches as it happens .  there s a big name in the crowd , and that s the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who s sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out .  this all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction .  what really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and  discovers there s a very good possibility it was a conspiracy .  as we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness  takes on what happened .  this is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it s extremely interesting to watch . . . then  it takes one wrong step .  we follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out .  but that s not the worst part of it : it s that it s the one person you didn t think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn t think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it .  it only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can t rely on rick s investigation to be all that interesting .  it s as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible .  events become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina .  that s where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay .  this time , it s a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena .  what went wrong ?  depalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this .  depalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , " blow out , " where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece .  but granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries .  at least his direction makes up partly for it .  then there s koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character s flaws come to life like he did in depalma s earlier " carlito s way , " a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well .  he can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort .  he s flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn t so formulaic .  a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup .  he may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like .  this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way .  as i was watching the first half hour , i couldn t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he d be given , and perhaps he d have to make a choice between who s he has to believe .  now there s a film .  unfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we ve seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma .

negativeC,' forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects .  set in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon .  they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells .  then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes .  not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood .  taking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ?  surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ?  the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller s name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play .  this is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale .  the play describes the film s opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play s charged atmosphere .  in the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora s box .  not only is credulity stretched but abigail s obsession is unfortunately spotlighted .  it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot .  not surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame .  when the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail .  with alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail s passion sets all this into inexorable motion .  abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor s love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft .  appropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched .  director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis  foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration .  otherwise , hytner s direction is unremarkable .  ryder s performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings .  her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful .  abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here .  paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves .  probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen s elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character .  a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed .  unfortunately , when john s audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost .  it is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions .  his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message .  the result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable .  when the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed .  far from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience . '
negativeC,' one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film .  after all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave .  he is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing .  however , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year .  the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation .  these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly .  it is edgar s ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : " it s only when things are over that they make sense . "  whether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided .  the thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone .  instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last .  only once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it .  but don t fret , it will surface again .  you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile .  but you hold hope for some time .  the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations .  it s only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope .  and with speeches like , " i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , " how can you expect to hold anyone s interest ?  to godard s credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene .  the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful .  watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him .  and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities .  the environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them .  unfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene .  sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words .  the second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image .  you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners .  the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies .  steven spielberg is picked on in particular .  while i ll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it s still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood .  it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn t necessarily an admirable storyteller .  the days of breathless are no more .

negativeC,' america loves convenience .  after all , we re the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control .  yet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far .  ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin  , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve " demolition " williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home .  when she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed " the commander , " " the rookies , " and the guy with the cool accent discover the town s residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents  head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches .  filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences .  the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story .  ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose .  attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced .  most of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube .  with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie-stomping fun to " me and my brother when we was kids . "  apparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment .  but , even in the film s darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite .  yes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt .  and as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand .  characters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ?  as long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed .  eventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson .  what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can t handle .  explosions are fun .  and even if the nukes don t get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will .  in the end this film defines itself when our cop s tribunal pronounces , " is that all you have to tell us ? "  for , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story . '
negativeC,' reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) .  the guy can t seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : " rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel " ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) .  his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight .  i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , " oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! "  it s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie .  and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ?  auteur theory be damned ; it s kruger s " style " , not the director s that winds up on screen .  kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut " sometimes less is more " .  and his numerous twists can t even claim to be originals ; arlington rd s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol  gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn t know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the " character " . . . grammar  be damned ) .   " how did you know that ? "  the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along .   .   .  since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it s no wonder why he works so frequently .  he s quickly becoming miramax s mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects .  this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles .  their company s current logo could be " we ride the trends " .  reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head .  although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick .  affleck is such a puppy dog that it s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone s bitch .  the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent " serious " movie getting .  it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who s played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance )  james frain is nick , rudy s cellmate , a manslaughterer who s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) .  ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she s never seen one picture of him .  which works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts .  he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino .  though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i ve described might as well be irrelevant .  this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner .  included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) .  though it s an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience .  the flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up .  it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau   ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this .  he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart .  problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play .  character problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off .  the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear .  but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster .  charlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next .  she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this .  gary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat .  these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience .

negativeC,' a follow-up to disney s live-action " 101 dalmatians " that s better , more entertaining than the first ?  just as unlikely .  with " 102 dalmatians , " the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier .  1996 s " 101 dalmatians " certainly wasn t the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance .  in addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies .  this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close s facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers .  but that s only half the problem with kevin lima s laborious film .  what makes " 102 dalmatians " such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he s a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic " heroes " of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? .  gruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can t even aspire to that .  the dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close s split ends are more animated .  bad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro s in " men of honor . "  jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu s over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail .  france s most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in " 102 dalmatians " the producers milk that realization for all it s worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as " poopies , " par example ( and ad nauseum ) .  the finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) .  that done , it s back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown .  the dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that s pretty much all they are .  there s always the feeling that there s a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder .  savvy holiday goers should skip " 102 dalmatians " and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead .  it s one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying .

negativeC,' one-sided " doom and gloom " documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible .  orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he , along with best-selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events .  the film is dated badly , as many things that are supposed to happen in the " future " never do .  for example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth .  we re still here .  the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse .  we re still here .  some of the more ludicrous moments come when it s alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! ) .  also , there s ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like .  if it s anything like it s depicted as here then it s going to be incredibly boring .  the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video .  it contains the film in standard form ( aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 ) , although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed .  also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey , as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release , chariots of the gods .  audio is mono dolby digital , and the video is fair to good for a film like this .  i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me .  certainly i never expected a remastered print .  curiously , the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case .  but they re menu screens . . .  so who really cares ?

negativeC,' play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton s sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways .  like most of shelton s other great films ( bull durham , white men can t jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots .  shelton s films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story .  shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions .  play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse .  the film has no social message like its predecessors .  the relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons .  the whole film , since it is primarily a " buddy picture , " depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other .  unfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below .  1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet .  the two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory .  2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas .  there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something .  3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way .  she is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other .  4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories .  vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner .  these boring tales only hurt the central plot .  5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don t even hesitate to pound each other .  wasn t the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ?  by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over .  shelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story .  forty five painful minutes remain .  the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies .  however , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film .

negativeC,' some movies i should just skip .  my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program .  true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it s a cartoon .  but it s a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen .  but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ?  turns out i was right , mostly .  inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick .  at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver .  this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where " formula " isn t just business , it s a way of life .  the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits .  in some parts you can just hear them saying " more zany !  i want more zany here -- and -- here . "   " let s have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful .  i want the audience squirming in their seats . "   " ok , that s fine , but i want you to add bug guts . "   " what does this scene do ?  character depth ?  but where s the zaniness ?  i don t see zany here .  if you can t make it zany , cut it ! "  the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie .  michelle ( who plays penny , gadget s niece ) shines in every scene she s in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time .  my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor .  dabney coleman s comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby .  i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes .  he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the " gidget bitch from hell " town mayor .  oteri s overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon s own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn t poking fun at our fair town .  or , maybe all career politicians are like that .  i must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla .  he appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget .  rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw .  joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself .  her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film .  d . l . hughley plays the shuckin -and-jivin  vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years .  the dialog is . . . let s face it , it s pretty bad .  the tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context .  a lot of the lines ( especially hughley s ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib .  about three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw .  gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really " battles " ) with the evil gadget .  penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon .  let me rage here just for a minute .  michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character .  she s utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective .  why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery .  the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity .  inspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it s a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment .  probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits .  the " evil sidekick support group " is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it s onscreen .  all in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films .  i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it s generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers .  but if true , why ?  if they re trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it .

negativeC,' hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell .  the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films .  in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous .  with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions .  such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results .  now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai .  unfortunately " romeo must die " bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong s rhythms .  the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking .  enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) .  kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai s boss and leader of the local chinese family .  a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down .  it s not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends .  the following morning po sing is found dead .  suspicions escalate , as issac o day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder .  his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture .  issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter .  the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder .  he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined .  hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work .  escaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother s death .   " romeo must die " is in many ways a fun film .  it is both absurd and assured .  the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes " the godfather " .  the relationship between jet li s han and aaliyah s trish o day reminds us of abel ferrera s " china girl " , except that romeo must die s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another .  their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history .  the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable .  li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination .  allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace .  it s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic .  but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it .  delro lindo as issac o day carries himself well in the film .  an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance .  the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac s son , colin .  the performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in .  an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written .  first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film .  having a career as one of the industry s best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and " romeo must die " does look good .  but the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes .  the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in .  the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing .  and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah s bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever .  the best things about the film are its fight scenes .  jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles .  one needs only to see his film " fist of legend " to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat .  here , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that " lethal weapon 4 " ( jet s u . s . debut ) didn t allow .  unfortunately , a lot of jet s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision .  also " romeo must die " must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent .  obviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba s " streetfighter " , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film .  it s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted .  one problem though about the fight scenes .  those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon .  they do have an internal rhythm to them .  a heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography .  the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance .  this is created by the performance , the direction and the editing .  here in " romeo must die " , there is no staccato .  every fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern .  the rhythm is monotonous .  a hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact .   rmd  is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever .  a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan s films . .  watch the restaurant fight from the film " rush hour " and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) .  now look at the warehouse fight from " rumble in the bronx " .  there you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn t let the audience catch its breath .  the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted .  here in  romeo must die  , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl .  jet li is a grand and personable screen presence .  it s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here .  one day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity .  until then , we ll be left with emotionally hollow product like " the replacement killer " and , currently " romeo must die " .

negativeC,' i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film .  i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , " it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach .  throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof !  we ll have a hit on our hands ! "  the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography .  the story is loosely based around the pro football players  strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels .  keanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption .  gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers .  rounding out the cast includes swingers  jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders .  this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny s .  the usual things happen like clockwork .  the hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax .  it s also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks .  howard deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of  80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes .  obviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end .  sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life .  the replacements offers none of this .

" bully " aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death . '

negativeC,' among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade .  those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star .  as director , ginty did very little to improve that impression .  the protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) .  however , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) .  one stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder .  however , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end .  belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots .  unfortunately , this film isn t comedy and any laugh is unintentional .  the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them .  the actors that play them don t help either .  that is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison .  his partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn t age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents .  ginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer .

negativeC,'  " lake placid " marks yet another entry in the series of " predator pics " that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- " jaws " ) and were revived recently by the godawful " anaconda . "   " placid " claims to be a " horror/comedy " -it s directed by the same guy who did " house " -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of " anaconda . "  paleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake .  discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile ( which shouldn t even be in this hemisphere ) , kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson ) .  they re joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them .  along the way , the merry band meets mrs . delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady who lives out on the lake .  you know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone s dangling legs while " jaws " -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who s obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can t possibly exist .  unlike its slippery cousin " anaconda , " " lake placid " wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating .  the result is neither scary nor funny ; it s just tedious .  while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of " friday the 13th " and " halloween h20 " ) , screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like " ally mcbeal " and " chicago hope " ) doesn t seem to have the stomach for a chomp  em up flick .  the body count is surprisingly low and doesn t include any of the major characters , and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it .   ( " lake placid " manages to have it both ways-i ll let you discover how for yourself ) .  the croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course .  like the snake in " anaconda , " the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn t seem real ; it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural .   " lake placid " also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine .  there is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how " we really don t know much about crocodiles . "  they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers .  a movie like this doesn t have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ?  creature from outer space ? ) , but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on .  pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot .  most of the time , they re probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers .  platt and white , on the other hand , seem to be giving their best efforts , and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script .

negativeC,' capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ?  starship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that .  it is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it s so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed .  it s one of the worst movies i ve seen in a long time .  why am i calling this movie pornography ?  pornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts .  i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as " a near-pornographic eternity " .  i didn t agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout " do  er , man , do  er ! "  that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers .  it s * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk .  it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening .  the film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn t appear to have intelligence .  to counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they re clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles .  this isn t heinlein , it s a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome .   ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too . )  the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic .  they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense .  they don t even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don t care about them .  we hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate .  here , we don t even hate the bugs -- what s there to hate ?  hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine .  if there s anything really hateful there , the movie doesn t know how to give it to us .  the screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be " screen typist " ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other .  one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who s great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again .  once or twice is fine .  by the fifth or sixth time , it s worn out its welcome .  there s never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle .  also , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry .  if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing .  but if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip .  uh-huh .  the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor .  i say " quasi- " because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- the movie doesn t have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject .  the bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison .  like the rest of the movie .  there s more , i suppose , but it s not worth it .  the acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ; the music disposable ; the camerawork turgid .  the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece .

negativeC,' the classic story & the production which ruined it  marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h . g . wells classic , new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel .  of course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title . . ) .  the story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific , who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after his plane crashes into the sea .  douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr . moreau , who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize .  his host s reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau s lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress .  even worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal " people . "  douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast-people community , which considers dr . moreau their maker .  using shock-therapy and the law , dr . moreau has long been able to keep his beast-people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal-men who are just too savage to be controlled .  the island of dr .  moreau questions the ability of men playing god .  dr . moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence . . . but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long .  moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp .  even so , the production has failed to make the most out of it .  there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is , the characters are not " prioritized " so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important , before they know it , he or she or it perishes . . . . rather  ungloriously at times too .  perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau s creations .  the two very important characters , montgomery and dr . moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably .  more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development .  i really would have liked it better if , say , they delved more into dr . moreau s obsession , montgomery s purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast-people had to rebel .  maybe the nature of the screenplay , which incidently , does not incorporate much action sequences in the film , forced the filmmakers to " cut a long story short " and make it more of an action film than anything else ( it s still summer , and movies have to be " marketable " ) .  the special effects too , are really nothing for anyone to shout about .  at most , i would say the beast-men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes .  this h . g . wells classic really has potential to be a good film .  unfortunately , after 2 adaptations , they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story .  as a third outing , the island of dr . moreau  accomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of `the planet of the apes  .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

negativeC,' lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient .  great acting , music and cinematography were nice , but too many dull sub-plots and characters made the film hard to follow .  ralph fiennes ( strange days , schindler s list ) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy , a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy .  the story revolves around his past , in flashback form , making it even more confusing .  anyway , he is taken in by hana ( juliette binoche , the horseman on the roof ) , a boring war-torn nurse .  she was never really made into anything , until she met an indian towards the end , developing yet another sub-plot .  count almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger ( willem dafoe , basquiat ) .  his love ( kirstin scott thomas , mission impossible ) was severely injured in a plane crash , and eventually died in a cave .  he returned to find her dead and was heart-broken .  so he flew her dead body somewhere , but was shot down from the ground .  don t get the wrong idea , it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting , but good is the last thing this film is .  maybe if it were an hour less , it may have been tolerable , but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle .  the only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography .  other than these , the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film .   , '
negativeC,' out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller .  though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it s not nearly good enough .  in an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery .  he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny .  he doesn t know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine .  valentine was jenny s former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive .  he s played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee s gold in 1997 .  seeking valentine s reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson .  he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party .  he winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine s head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it .  what a mess .  i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer .  the limey does exactly that .  the plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose .  there is no method to this movie s madness .  it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably .  the plot isn t particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving .  this is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn t speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude .  i felt like the director wasn t very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck .  ditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant .  sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal .  he s not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here .  peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he s shy , quiet but always effective .  he s adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don t always show on his face by you can always tell what they are .  this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion .  why soderbergh couldn t just parrot down and tell a story , i don t know , but what he does do certainly doesn t work .  the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don t work .  1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it .  shall we go back to basics ?

negativeC,' a pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines , high art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists .  in the only notable part of the movie , ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles , not that lisa cholodenko s script or direction makes you care much about either character .  living in a world of heroin induced highs , they float along until they fall in love with each other .  this uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant .  24-year-old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live-in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine " frame . "  although the receptionist is impressed , syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ( ally sheedy ) .  for her to do photos for " frame , " lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her .  lucy lives with her current lover , a washed up german actress named greta , played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson .  the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope , usually heroin .  this does not happen in a single episode , but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture .  syd , who lives in the apartment below them , joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club .  lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs , which apparently is funded by her mother .  lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being " pigeonholed , " and , since her mother has money , we can only assume that that s how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses .  a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer s work is transcendental or merely classical .  that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny .   " your work has a cultural currency that is important now , " is the artist-speak that the frame s manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine .  when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd , her idea of a romantic line is , " i want to get high with you . "  in lucy s world , sex and drugs come hand-in-hand .  and the movie , except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing , shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene .  this vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions .  in another movie , it might have worked , but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted .  high art runs 1 : 36 .  it is rated r for explicit sex , pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age .

negativeC,'  " party camp , " is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i ve seen in awhile .  a late rip-off of the " meatballs " series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk .  that s really about all that can be said about the " plot " because nothing much happens , except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax .  how fun !  since , " party camp , " has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative .  it s not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex .  even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick .  at least , then , it wouldn t have been such a chore to sit through .  never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat .  the comedy was easy to spot , but it wasn t the least bit funny .  it was groan-inducing .  constantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything .  so what saves , " party camp , " from the dreaded zero star rating ?  well , that s simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch .  although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy .

negativeC,' when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy , i expect negative reviews from critics left and right .  predictable , unoriginal , and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you s and the drive me crazy s released by the dozens these last couple of years .  what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i m sitting in the theater .  am i enjoying myself ?  is this a comfortable break from my week of finals ?  this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks ; i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won t remember next week .  so last week i opened up the new york times - and , no surprise , boys and girls got a negative review .  daily news ?  negative .  reelviews ?  negative .  epinions . com ?  negative .  this was nothing new .  american pie , final destination , road trip didn t get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures .  same goes for she s all that , a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded .  since boys and girls reunites she s all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr . , i predicted d ? j ? vu al over again .  but , still curious , i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it , the reactions were far from positive .  i had made up my mind ; i ll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years .  but , soon after , following a series of unexpected events ( we couldn t get into shaft because it is rated r ) , i found myself watching boys and girls .  whoops .  boys and girls is about a " nerdy , smart " boy named ryan ( prinze jr . ) and a " popular , flirt " girl named jennifer ( claire forlani ) .  briefly meeting as pre-teens and now attending the same college , the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends .  but in the movies , a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other .  with advice from their roommates ( amanda detmer , jason biggs ) , ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship .  the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found .  i could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons .  the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie , mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to .  it is almost offensive .  an example of an insightful conversation :   " you re dumb .  dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb . "   " no . "   ( followed by a mandy moore-esque tune background )   ( well it s not as bad as wing commander i guess )  the supporting cast is also painfully useless .  detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring , pointless subplots .  and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex , prinze jr s ryan dominates the screen while forlani s jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with .  we never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character .  teenager or not : you ll hate this movie , i guarantee it .  maybe i should rent she s all that again .  is it really as good as i think it is ?

negativeC,' all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood .  ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996 s other , underperforming disaster films ( dante s peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year .  but , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank .  no number of name changes can help this picture .  it s not just about a disaster , it is a disaster .  hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute .  the best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises .  the community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies .  from that moment on , it s all downhill .  whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point .  it takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured .  basically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs .  there s a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions .  it s all very routine and uninteresting because there aren t any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense .  the film s conclusion is so preposterous that it s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around .  action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion .  graham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle .  unfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it .  the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition .  we see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again .  the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length .  the storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances .  there s tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash .  he and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv s " lou grant " ) , get stuck on a street that s rapidly turning into a river .  a group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers .  after charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs .  as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg s roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives .  there isn t any real acting in this film .  christian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera .  tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen .  randy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing .  morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script .  freeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time .  following in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn t trust nature s fury as the chief engine of conflict .  as a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had .  titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water .  hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible .  thus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) .  fortunately , there are only two elements left .

negativeC,' instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as " powerful " or " touching " .  i have a name for it myself : " gross " .  this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the " rebel " threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too .  how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren t present day moviegoers beyond being " inspired " by something like that ?  this is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience s intelligence .  instinct s plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa .  he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him .  after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison s " psychotics ward " .  assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) .  caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career .  of course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison .  and then there s the inevitable " heartless meanie " character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder s mentor .  he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell .  let s get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off .  any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way .  not good old theo .  no , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says " we need to talk about this right now . "  this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct s already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it s also the least of its problems .  director jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie s promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs .  it s not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) .  it aims to " inspire " rather than to touch hearts .  as yoda would say , inspire it does not .  it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie s story .  indeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film s plot to another character .  this , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence .  i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation .  i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever .  oscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful .  his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink .  i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling .  i love animals , and instinct s prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with .  however this movie s execution is completely unacceptable .  tone down the violence and this will be a chick flick .   ? 1999 eugene novikov '
negativeC,' sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality .  he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict .  but , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet s reputation .  a stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir s witness , belongs to the latter category .  the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york .  during one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed .  in order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community .  emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder .  concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover .  that isn t easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways .  things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) .  using peter weir s formula isn t the greatest flaw of this film .  even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent .  but the worst insult to viewer s audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith .  the author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles .  role of emily eden , unfortunately , isn t one of them .  first of all , she can t pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn t much better .  screenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) .  but , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community .  also , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture .  that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time .

negativeC,'  " the world on land -- it s just too big for me . "  starring tim roth , pruitt taylor vince , bill nunn , clarence williams iii .  rated r .  the legend of 1900s is the year s most absurd movie , a rambling , nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast .  it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth , looking wistful as ever , as a guy named . . .  1900 .  you heard right .  his name is , in all actuality , 1900 .  he was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 ( uh , hence the name ) , abandoned and adopted by danny , a ship crewman .  1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny s fear that he might be taken away from him because of " visa matters . "  well , when 1900 is about 9 or so , he starts wondering all around the ship .  one day , he discovers a grand piano .  he sits down and starts playing .  miraculously , what comes out is beautiful .  a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age .  when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is " totally against regulations " 1900 replies " f * ck the regulations ! "  ho ho ho .  1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land .  when he s about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody s business , onboard comes another musician .  his name is max ( pruitt taylor vince ) and he plays the trumpet .  after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm , he sits him down on the piano next to him , takes the piano s braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall , taking them with it .  how the chair they re sitting on and the piano don t separate , i don t know , but this apparently isn t the kind of thing we re supposed to ask .  after that , 1900 and max become friends .  max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land , but 1900 has no intention of doing so .  what s more , he doesn t even want his music to go anywhere without him : when a record company hears about his talents , they come on board to make a record of his music , but after finding out that -- gasp !  -- they re going to make millions of copies , he breaks the record .  the conflict of the movie is that after max , unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship , gets off himself , he stumbles upon a record of 1900 s music in a store .  the record shouldn t exist because a ) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b ) the one record that was made on the ship was broken .  ladies and gentlemen , it s a mystery !  the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements .  we re supposed to be roused by a climactic . . .  piano duel ?  there isn t anything in this movie with the potential to compel .  1900 comes off as a whiny , brooding , extremely unlikable man : i can t recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo- meditation on life .  ditto for max , who doesn t seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900 .  tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf ; there s no spirit , no gusto to the character .  he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship , but to us he is dead .  pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable , at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit .  the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant , leering " king of jazz " who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel .  the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore , whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many .  this effort is utterly limp and lifeless .  at once ridiculous , boring , narrow-sighted and pointless , this is one movie that should be -- and will be -- quickly forgotten .

negativeC,' my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free .  as lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book .   ( " without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . " )  languidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending .  since it s rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery .  other than a few nice visuals , there s nothing to recommend the picture .  with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he s more than the world s best oscar host .  he does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year s father s day and this year s my giant .  one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project .  surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there .  perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success .  or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie s somber tone .  the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day .  this one-joke movie s single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible .  sammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) .  after throwing out constant one-liners ( " either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . " ) ,  sammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket .  and although he doesn t like it , he s willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs .   ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . )  after a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie .  we learn that max s condition is terminal , and he will soon die .  to be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers .  let s hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie .  my giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 .  it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up .  my son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it .  matthew pointed out that it " is not as good as it could have been or should have been . "   ( amen . )  he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle .  jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was . '
negativeC,' talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters !  spice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls .  it s intended as a sort of hard day s night , but ends up simply hard to watch .  when watching the spice girls , i m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name .  the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented .  there s ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you re almost certain the post sticks out her throat .  the film itself doesn t really have a plot .  it follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their " first live performance " at albert hall .  the action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas .  the various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even  when they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff .  whew .  for some reason , the film is littered with star cameos .  from elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf .  heck , even roger moore shows up , though he can t decide if he s parodying himself as james bond , or if he s lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld .  richard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band s manager , clifford .  the celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film .  neither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring .  their songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos .  my advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either  option will be more enjoyable than the film .  non-fans should know to stay well away from this one .

negativeC,' this feature is like a double header , two sets of clich ? s for the price of one .  not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts , but the banal rich girl-poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure .  an original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance .  the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins , based on a story by falls , merely lobs its plotline at the audience .  this is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching .  summer catch centers around ryan dunne ( freddie prinze jr . ) , a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league , supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country .  ryan is a blue-collar kind of guy .  he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod s rich and famous .  he also , as we are informed early , his own worst enemy .  he has the potential and the talent , but always seems to self-destruct at the crucial moment .  so , ryan tries to remained focused on baseball .  then he meets tenley parrish ( jessica biel ) , daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures .  tenley , a name only a hack screenwriter could invent , is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan .  if you can t figure out where all this nonsense leads , then you need a remedial course in film viewing .  as always prinze is pretty to look at , but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions : puppy dog love , heartbreak , frustration , self-loathing or determination .  biel cries a lot , while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class-conscious father .  the only beacon is matthew lillard s fun-loving billy brubaker , the team s catcher .  summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies , such as bull durham and the natural .  no curve balls here , no sliders .  every pitch is predictable .  a blind umpire could call this movie .  summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking .  it has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn .

negativeC,' one of the responses those that enjoy " detroit rock city " ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i ve given the film might be something like : " oh , that casey s gone and become a jaded critic on us .  just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n  roll movie like this ? "  i m wondering the same thing .  i feel like i should have had a grand time with " detroit rock city . "  it s the sort of movie i wish i could ve had a lot of fun with , but i didn t .  i just didn t .  surely this film isn t trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ?  no , but i expected something .  a funny joke .  a clever prank .  a plot development .  anything .  the movie never delivers .  you ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing .   " detroit rock city " is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film s existence , and it s not a very satisfying realization .  the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan .  that s it .  there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot .  the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) .  they have a garage band .  they re pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n  roll , so i guess that means we root for them .  they have tickets , they lose them .  they get more tickets , they lose those too .  they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire .  there s not much more to it .  frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys  hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity .  oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency .  she doesn t want them to see kiss , if you hadn t figured that out already .  it s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this .  we ve got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy .  then again , " maximum overdrive " had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time .   " detroit rock city " doesn t quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close .  in fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind .  basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc s " highway to hell " sounds like something my neighbor s cat coughed up ) .  it s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it  s evident that they re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie .  edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they ve got to make a living in hollywood .  people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song .  too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess .  director adam rifkin knows he hasn t got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning .  we get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script .  it s fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting .  i would recommend that those who felt seasick at " the blair witch project " stay far away from " detroit rock city , " because the witch has got nothing on this baby .  i haven t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since " armageddon . "  and what about that script ?  it s written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i ve ever heard .  if it is , i can t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible .  a plotless , pointless rock n  roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny .  the jokes in " detroit rock city " rarely are .  in fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal .  the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it " comedy . "  there is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up .  it s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , " see ?  funny ! "  look , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink .  see ?  funny !  look , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver .  twice .  see ?  funny !  look , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money .  see ?  funny !  a word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren t funny all by themselves .  they must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn  t predicted them five minutes in advance .  that s it , i ve said enough about this movie .  it s a waste of time and money .  i liked the music , but don t bother buying the soundtrack .  i hear it  s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie .  you want to see this concept executed well ?  go rent roger corman s 1979 classic " rock n  roll high school . "  it features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show .  yes , go rent that , and skip " detroit rock city , " which will probably bomb , and deservedly so .

"  was one line , if i remember correctly .  at the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda .  he is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off .  patterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) .  the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy .  they are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature .  give me a break .  the movie hasn t got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us .  even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic .  get this : remington s big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up .  he does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird .  by the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand .  the acting is forgettable .  douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it s nothing he hasn t done before .  kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography .  the camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent .  what did i expect from this movie ?  i dunno .  some real excitement , i suppose .  a sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation .  no such luck .  i dug out my tattered copy of hemingway s " the short happy life of francis macomber " and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind . '
negativeC,' unfortunately it doesn t get much more formulaic than one tough cop .  there s the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain .  the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys , the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film .  bo dietl ( pronounced deedle , baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia .  on top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops aren t immune ? ) .  then , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) .  right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama .  but right in the middle of the film , they throw in a completely un-related plot point .  dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from .  the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death .  once the case is solved , the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue .  whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably .  aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good .  baldwin , though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec , does a fine job as one tough cop .  penn , who also slips into an impression of his brother sean , is even better as a loser tough guy cop .  what one tough cop lacks is originality .  this film offers nothing new .  nothing that you can t get from any cop film .  it screams sidney lumet all over the place , perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman , producers of lumet s dog day afternoon and serpico .  but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film .  too much else is lacking .  i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture , something that i almost never notice .  but once i saw that , i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot .  at times , i was hoping to see it .  one tough cop isn t laughable , nor is it a terrible film , but it just isn t unique .  it is a classic example of a film that didn t need to be made .  but one thing is for sure , it could really use a better title . '
negativeC,' supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898 .  john patterson ( val kilmer ) , the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation , tried to rid his operation of the lions , but fails .  a world renound hunter , remington ( michael douglas ) , is called in and the battle , man against lion , begins .  this film has a great soundtrack , and wonderful scenery .  the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin .  we only see one side of each character .  kilmer is a bridge builder and that s all we see him as .  these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn t even appear to be too upset about it .  and the plot ?  it s jaws , but with lions .  again we re presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should .  it appears to kill men because it just likes too .  why ?  who knows .  i guess there wouldn t be much of a story if it didn t .  the problem is that there isn t much of a story even though it does .

negativeC,' of course i knew this going in .  why is it that whenever a tv-star makes a movie it s always a romantic comedy , and then they say on entertainment tonight or something , that they were " attracted to the characters .  they were really original . "  original ? ! let me give you a run-through of picture perfect : character a ) kate ( jennifer aniston , from tv s friends ) , a smart , beautiful , professional woman wants two things she can t have : a new job-title and the love of her co-worker kevin bacon .  her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar , and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls .  what does she do ?  she invents a fiance !  then when everyone wants to meet him , she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job , since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor , defenceless female .  he , of course , goes along with it .  gee , i wonder if they get together in the end .  i ve seen more original stuff on the wb .  and better stuff too .  picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes , and expecting us to like aniston s character , who comes off as a cold , spoiled bitch .

negativeC,' louie is a trumpeter swan with no voice .  in order to woo his lady love serina , louie makes friends with a young boy , sammy , who persuades teacher mrs . hammerbottom ( carol burnett ) to allow louie to attend class .  louie learns to read and write and returns to his flock , but is laughed at once again when no other swans can understand his message of love for serina .  to make matters worse , louie s father feels he s lost his honor because of the trumpet he stole for his son in this animated version of e . b .  white s " trumpet of the swan . "  as jane austen and henry james have become popular sources for adult filmmakers over the past decade or so , e . b .  white is being returned to for children s films .  the animated " charlotte s web " has become a minor classic since its release in 1973 and 1999 brought us a live action version of " stuart little . "   " trumpet of the swan , " directed by richard rich ( 1999 s animated " the king and i , " the " swan princess " series ) , is unlikely to be remembered along with those two .   " trumpet of the swan " is receiving a regional theatrical release , but is sure to quickly appear on home video .  boston is one of the targetted cities because our hero louie becomes famous playing his trumpet in beantown .  he encounters a gypsy-like con man in the public gardens who pitches louie and his trumpet as an added attraction to boston s swan boats .  louie stays at the ritz carlton before giving a concert at the hatch shell along the banks of the charles river .  at this point , louie s earned enough money so that dad can pay for the trumpet and become musically capable enough to win over serina s father .   " trumpet of the swan " features flat background art , some poor sound syncing and insipid , sugary songs .  this effort would be better suited to saturday morning television than the big screen , but may be ok for the real small set .

negativeC,' one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles .  he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star .  after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film .  unfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for .  we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do .  then the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is .  the plot of men with guns can be summarized " in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas .  dr . fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went .  and he found out again and again and again . "  of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell .  a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians .  but the film talks down to the viewer .  dr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country .  he has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios .  fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service .  then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy .  in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others .  the student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be .  fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general .  the results are little different than one would expect .  dr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive .  even some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains .  but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was .  sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians .  the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences .  federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos .  damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter .  mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer .

"  cool .  so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie .  that s cool , too .  but , ollie , old sage , do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade .  i m just eager to meet you one day , so i can buy you a stoli , look you in the eye and say , " what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with u-turn ? "  and i ll stand there staring  til i get a straight answer .  sean penn stars u-turn , as bobby , a drifter who s had some troubles a while back .  he s heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose , stranding him in superior , arizona , held there by an " ignorant , inbred , turtleneck hick " of a mechanic named darrell .  while darrell puts a new hose on the ride , bobby walks into town to see what s cooking .  is it needless of me to say that superior , arizona , is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely ?  probably not .  bobby meets up with grace ( jennifer lopez ) , who invites him back to her place , for drape-hanging and other domestic issues .  just as those issues are starting up , grace s husband , jake , storms in , looking like check-out day of the elks lodge convention .  just beats bobby silly .  bobby takes to the road , only to meet up with jake again , and jake asks bobby to kill grace .  a little while later , grace asks bobby to kill jake .  them murderous arizonians .  gotta love  em .  if any of this sounds familiar , congratulations .  you win a kewpie doll .  the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west , a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl , maker of the phenomenal the last seduction .  but the contest doesn t end there , guys and gals .  we get steals from russ meyer movies , where everybody in town is horny and sweaty .  we get the town from bad day at black rock , minus the train , plus busty women who can speak .  look at any schwarzenegger film , and you ll see our hero , bobby , as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times , has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times , gets bit by a tarantula , gets shot at , and ends up with vultures circling overhead , all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick .  bobby as terminator ?  stretch it a bit , and we have a five-finger discount from doc hollywood , where the whole story occurs because of car trouble , forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic .  okay , he s working from a book , so maybe ollie s not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas .  i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative .  i just wish he hadn t brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe-stub .  sean penn gives a great performance , and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be , playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters .  the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety-blank is going on .  too bad it s not fun to watch when it s happening to us . . . while  we sit through this mess of a film .  u-turn is not a bad film if you re a fan of technique .  it s the oliver stone you ve always known .  robert richardson is his usual cinematographer , and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick -- great camera angles , shifting viewpoints , wicked colors , nice looking pictures .  but pictures of what ?  i think i d rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt-o-whirl point of this loser film .  plot twists are one thing , repetition is almost unforgivable , and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i ve seen in the past five years .  oliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at .  you ve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie , and films like platoon , jfk , wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on .  your scripts are certainly respectable , your budgets are up there on the screen , and your actors don t dog it .  and i know that , maybe , with u-turn , you were just kicking back , just having fun .  that s fine .  but don t do that with a movie with the potential of this one .  do some police academy sequel ( imagine that . )  do a big comedy , like a remake of it s a mad , mad , mad , mad world .  but do not drop a limp u-turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as " an oliver stone movie , " and not question why it stinks like week-old snook .  there s a right way to have fun , and a wrong way to have fun .  this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail . '
negativeC,' there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs .  one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film .  two is never greenlight a sci-fi film starring john travolta .  to wit , we present the disaster that is battlefield earth .  a science-fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild , battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior .  sci-fi is always a tricky beast : tight script , a good director , an ensemble cast of decent actors , and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs .  battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes .  here s the `plot .    the year is 3000 .  mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) .  a small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons  who dwell in the cities below .  the psychlos are strip-mining the earth for its resources and terel , played by travolta , is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver .  a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler , played with dramatic flair by barry pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons .    he is promptly captured and taken to the alien base .  after several attempts at escape , johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel s , involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end .  jonnie , assumed leader of the mining slave group , then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use .  then the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry , the bill of rights , how to use a machine gun , and how to fly a harrier jet .  the whole mess concludes with a big , loud , obnoxious gun-and-plane battle that had me praying for the end credits .  roger christian , the director of this lumbering beast , must have rented dune , blade runner , planet of the apes , independence day , stargate , beastmaster , the airwolf episodes , the `v  miniseries , the matrix , and the omega man . . .  and decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth .  christian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie !  and every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really .  the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit .  travolta s acting hasn t been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect .  jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight !    then there s the script : the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet  would be a difficult task to achieve .  why ?  because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt -- for no particular reason beside the fact that `humans are stupid .    terel may be right , you know .  humans made this movie .

negativeC,' would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you d be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ?  let me tell you what reality is .  reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot .  that s reality .  america s sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran , presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh ) .  the plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle s release , a film called time over time .  the only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis ) .  gosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage .  veteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven t seen the movie at all .   ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab . )  and did i mention gwen s sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ?  and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ?  oh billy , you re a scamp !  the script you ve co-written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ?  and bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure , but it s not a funny one .  yes , crystal tells us , hollywood is lying to our faces !  if you are surprised by this , you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine .  it s about to expire .  aside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) ,  america s sweethearts  jokes aren t funny , its pace is choppy , and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star julia roberts -- but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself .  i didn t time it ( the movie s not that bad ) , but it s crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film .  bad move , billy -- your jokes suck .  the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie s gags -- and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene , how this movie earned a pg-13 rating is a mystery to me .  julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend s wedding into a winning film , but not even that 90-tooth smile can save her here .  obviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise .  none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he s supposed to be macho .  as for roth , in case you don t know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution , which produced this work .  he s back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years .  it ll probably be another 11 before he s back again .  i could drone on about how america s sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth-breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies , but that would get old .  instead , i ll settle for discussing the movie s worst sin : that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable , not just in its plot but in its sentiment .  every single character in this film ( with the arguable exception of kiki ) is simply hateful , and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains .  when you leave the theater , you ll ask yourself , too : why would i want any of these jerks to be happy ?

negativeC,' rated : r for strong violence , language , drug use , nudity , and some sexuality .  starring : wesley snipes , anne archer , michael chaykin , donald sutherland , marie matiko .  running time : 117 minutes  directed by : christian duguay  i ve never fully understood wesley snipes s career .  he has his ups and downs , but mostly the downs .  his best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled " blade " .  he has had his typical action movies , " boiling point " , " passenger 57 " , but his new movie " the art of war " should just be called " rising sun 2 : the art of war " cause basically it s a semi-remake of the same plot , with a different cast , and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller , that is high on style and low on substance .  wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u . n . after a chinese ambassador is killed , he is on the track of the killer , trying to find out who it is , how it happened , where the killer was , and what to do .  anne archer plays his " boss " type person of the u . n . and she has hired snipes to track down the killer .  well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer , and is now an outlaw , kidnapping a chinese woman with him , and having her help him along the way .  all this leads to a finale that is so dumb , and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb , and the stunts , dialogue and acting all ruin this movie .  wesley snipes isn t one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before .  the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998 s " blade " .  i walked into " the art of war " expecting a good , high octane thriller , and all i got was a pile of mush .  the only real  good  thing the movie has is action , and plenty of it , but i noticed it is badly filmed , the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on .  the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful , that it even tries to mock " the matrix " , laughably funny , it is undeniably stupid .  christian duguay s direction is also not that great .  his camera angles and sense of style are all in place , but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done .  even the whole " matrix " ending wasn t even good .  the stunts and action are badly filmed , and badly choreographed .  his placing of the characters , and the assination of the chinese ambassador , and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable , that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie .  anne archer who is usually good in her roles , turns in a horrible job here .  she is sour , downbeat , and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue , and dumb moves .  even donald sutherland as a co-star can t save this movie from being a bust .  so for an overall opinion : " the art of war " is a total waste of time .  it s not entertaining , nor exciting , or even action packed .  it is a pointless movie , and makes absolutely no sense at all .  if you really want to see a good version of " the art of war " , rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind " rising sun " , it isn t a great film either , but at least it s better than this .

negativeC,' movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable .  i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in  95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics .  we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too .  this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) .  the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno .  so , it does indeed have some plusses . . .  in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff .  and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone .  this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? )  far too annoying far too often .  like in 1998s " bulworth " , when the movie was over i didn t care one little iota about the main character .  at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though .   " showgirls " is too stupid to make a statement .  some people claim that the story is based on the legendary " all about eve " of all things !  if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l . mankiewicz was , he d be . . . well ,  he d be a good screenwriter .  instead , this project may have sunk his career .  he wrote the ( ha ha ! )  script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed .  the same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( " basic instinct " ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones .  the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer .  after the supposed street-smart young " lady " gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the " stardust hotel " .  nomi doesn t take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away .  first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club .  she sells her hot little wares at " the cheetah " for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience .  hey , i never said she wasn t a hot number . . .  maybe it s that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the " stardust hotel " , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn t her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) .  crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) .  he also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show .  crystal gets nomi onto the " stardust " team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi " earns " the role of crystal s understudy .  the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal .  it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she s " not a whore " .  that s a phrase we hear a few different times and it s completely ludicrous .  of course she is !  she sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we re supposed to believe that she s a better person than that .  we re supposed to root for her .  no way !  she s a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the . . . ahem . . . climax .  she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is .  the sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more .  it sure ain t character development !  plummer also appeared in " speed " in  94 in a smaller , yet better role .  this sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control .  kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his standards have dipped since appearing in " blue velvet " .  that picture was weird , but some critics claim it s one of the best movies of the  80s .  now ol  kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the  90s , too .  his sleazy character is important to " showgirls " , but we don t learn anything about him .  he uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie .  is he a villain ?  who cares !  ultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit .  everyone must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool .  what few reviewers take issue with is how mean-spirited this movie is .  everyone s either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge .  it s just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) .  if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn t verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ?  it s hard to care about these people if we can t even appreciate what they re capable of doing on-stage .  berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body .  after all , the world of porn is still an active , dishonourable profession .  perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford .  oops , they re bad actors , too .  well , at least , they re not selfish and contemptable like good ol  slutty nomi malone .  useless trivia--ironically , elizabeth berkley played virtuous and " holier than thou " jessie on the teeny-bopper tv show , " saved by the bell " , before breaking onto the big screen .

negativeC,' mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect .  a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile .  however , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie s best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever .  jackie chan plays , who else , jackie .  this time out , he s a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show .  not that it ever makes a difference in the plot .  there are only two scenes of him cooking .  for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop .  it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ?  a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons .  although she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm ,  shades of broadcast news ? ? ?  anyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape .  here lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn t anyone realize you can copy a tape ?  oh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense .  as luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn t you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape .  this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie .  in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language .  however , that doesn t mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie s recent americanized releases .  strangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too .  whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie s dubbed films .  the plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons .  but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie s films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread .  look , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ?  watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts .  the action is a mixed bag here .  there s really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie s films .  it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan .  the action in the film is neither jackie s best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes .  the film s gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting .  once or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence .  but to slo-mo jackie running ?  either this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down .  if you ve seen all of jackie s films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy .  however , if you re just in the mood for some good action , you d be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop .

negativeC,'  " first rule of fight club is , don t talk about fight club . "  this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it s not even worth mentioning .  director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge .  with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i m surprised i didn t walk out .  this just goes to show that hype kills .  it s very rare that a film so hyped up as " fight club " turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception .  the story goes like this .  edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) .  norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended .  apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain .  why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse .  norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it s on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) .  the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight .  how do they come up with this stuff ?  anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser s attention , and a club is formed .  out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message .  fincher shows us that society is like robots .  we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out .  our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others .  call me crazy , but this is common knowledge .  i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably .  even with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story .  i couldn t help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp .  it just shows how desperate the script is for attention .  i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself .  his bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee .  it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more .  helena bonham carter however really had no purpose .  she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left .  this continues for what seems like 6 hours .  the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while " fight club " nears what i think might be the end .  unfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom .  though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace .  on a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer .  fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson .  concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won t do any good if everything else is in need of support .  also , i m afraid that immature men might respond to the film s violence .  the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult .  when the film ends , i m just glad to get home and take some advil .  you ll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says " this is so f * * * ing stupid .

negativeC,' note to screenwriters and self : when you hit the big time , and the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your bottom drawer , tell ? em all to hit the road .  gilligan wrote the arbitrarily-titled home fries ten years ago ; it was shelved until he found success as one of " the took a second look at gilligan s " comedy " - they read it again wearing rose-tinted glasses .  drew stars as sally , a dim ( but sweet ) , pregnant waitress at a small town burger joint located somewhere in the southern united states .  the father of her child is dead , the victim of a severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons - these flyboys scared him with their low-flying helicopter .  dorian ( wilson ) and angus ( busey ) were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother ( o hara ) .  trouble is , sally picked up some interference on her drive-thru headset , and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior to the accidental killing .  so dorian goes undercover as a burger-flipper ; before you can say " with cheese " he falls for the mother-to-be .  too bad mom and angus have homicidal plans for sally .  does this sound like a movie you want to see ?  without a doubt , the best thing about home fries is barrymore ; at the risk of sounding sexist , she s never looked better than here , as a curly redhead with twinkling eyes .  she is winning in a role that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look apple-cheek cute and gawk at wilson , her real-life boyfriend .  but the plot and the situations are so off-putting that nothing could save it .  this movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers , but home fries  brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel .  it s raising arizona without babies , without charm , without laughs , without human characters , and without intelligence ; worst of all , it s creepy .  what s funny about threatening to gun down a pregnant woman with a machine gun ?   ( unless the woman in question is a spice girl . )  take out the helicopters , the quasi-incestuous relationship between the mother and her sons ( it is absolutely illogical , within the movie s framework , that dorian still lives with his mother and brother ) , and the scenes of murder ( attempted and otherwise ) , and what are you left with ?  the story of a single woman with child who works at a fast food joint ( but dreams of becoming a country singer ) .  that could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made , but it d be better than home fries .

negativeC,' the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from " l . a . confidential " to " palmetto " to " the big lebowski , " has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors .  with this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir .   " wild things " could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol  erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn t qualify for is that of a quality motion picture .  overacted , overwrought and overlong , " wild things " is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too .  with its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness .  in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , " wild things " not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc . there s not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical .  directed by john mcnaughton ( " henry : portrait of a serial killer " ) , " wild things " follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who s the dream of every spruced up female in the community .  particularly one .  kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner .  soon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house .  next thing , she cries rape .  and the so-called " roller-coaster ride " ensues .  a second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin  , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen .  even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo s zany lawyer .  he wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray .  you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role .  as ridiculous as it sounds , he s the most sane character in the movie .  the community is astonished .  reporters flee to the scene .  there s an 8 . 5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly s mother ( theresa russell ) .  there s the ambiguous cop ( kevin bacon , who also executive produced ) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust .  we , the audience , sniff something not so lustful .  like so many thrillers these days , including " the usual suspects " and " the game , " " wild things " eschews character for plot .  mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera , and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease , as if he knows the territory he s covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany " henry , " a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force .  george clinton s score is a delight to behold .  but it s the humans .  the characters are mere devices for the " nasty " twists .  what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving , almost unbearable , if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting , don t feel real or we don t care for them .  not even the unintentionally funny moments work .  the people in " wild things " are not so much people as they are caricatures .  then there s the erotic content , which nearly earned the film an nc-17 , for a sexless , badly edited , poorly lit menage-a-trois .  and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country , kevin bacon s member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go .  ironically , the wildest elements of " wild things " are not wild at all . '
negativeC,' it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film .  they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like .   ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . )  they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user s answer to deep impact .  bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond " zero barrier " and destroys our planet .  why an oil driller ?  they require someone experience with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid .   ( in one unintentionally ( ? )  hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it .  we trust nasa to build space shuttles ? )  harry assembles the obligatory " ragtag " bunch of " cowboys " , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) .  once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes .  whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal .  nor will you care .  i will say this : you know you re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope .  willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck .  their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material .  steve buscemi s character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic .   " rockhound " , as he s called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film .  so why did they bring him up there to begin with ?  rather , why write him into the film ? -give  his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig .  i m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue .  liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father s band s ( " aerosmith " ) songs grace the soundtrack .  director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen .   ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate s brain . )  whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out " we lost ( insert dead person s last name here ) ! "  i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses  faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood .  armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla .  it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework .  it has a vivid soundmix .  but at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story .  the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever .  bollocks !  the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler .  remember a little film called jaws ?  in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark .  they didn t much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another .  one of jaws  great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories .  this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end .  not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before " action " was called .  a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don t bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery .  to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn t build a birdhouse .  and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life .

negativeC,' there s a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact .  i d say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release .  the early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes .  deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking .  the repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there s a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem .  then we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense .  the mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there s a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem .  it goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail .  how do we know this ?  because we ve seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that " the comet is still headed right for us " and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading .  ladies and gentlemen , that is the movie .  successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots .  television is what s wrong with deep impact .  the main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that s the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy .  she thinks it s an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area .  when she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps .   " i know you re just a reporter , but you used to be a human being . "  she figures out what s really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet .  upon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question .  and everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you re a star .  leoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet s collision course with earth .  and i m sure it s comforting for her to know that , even though the world s ending in a matter of months , she s a cable news personality .  so there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up .  such personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process .  but as anyone who s seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail .  they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth .  yeah , thanks , nasa .  that s when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren t picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years .  they even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave .  if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie .  instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town .  the reasoning is , of course , that if a comet is going to strike , they might as well be out in some scenic rural location .  and , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks .  i m sure it s comforting to know that , even though the world s ending in a matter of minutes , the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives .

negativeC,'  " there will be another , " the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ?  true , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994 s the crow , anyway .  the idea of spinning artist james o barr s original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world .  given that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions .  of course , it doesn t .  stubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee s eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death .  i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality .  in flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind .  it s loud and repetitive , true , a sadist s delight -- but it s also horrifying and fascinating .  city of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully .  there s an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won t be much of a success .  in fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings .   ( i ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . )  so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup .  this time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead .  perez might have some screen presence if he s given something to do with himself , but here he s simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face .  at first , he s shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave .  he s befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film .  kirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank .  tattooed with angels  wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress .  the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve .  iggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film .  like all good things here , he s dispatched too soon and without much imagination .  in the meantime , we re subjected to tedious glimpses of judah s compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren t distinctly secondhand .  even the soundtrack is tired .  more than anything i ve seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it s a movie with a lousy script but a great look .  critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn t that bad per se .  he s got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery .  his major stylistic failing is that he can t seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie .  but as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn t , the performers who couldn t , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved .  who bought david s . goyer s anemic script , anyway ?  the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference .

negativeC,' late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an " artificial conversation " with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) .  the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy .  the film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial .  filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster .  prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles  freshman co-ed .  at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how " cute " it can be .  the happy couple " psychoanalyze " each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze s dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love .  then , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart .  why ?  well , because they have to .  otherwise the couple can t make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after .  down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic .  scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead .  a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat .  the supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well .  stiles  best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze s roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can t meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) .  he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film .  you know , the average porn star .  the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he s on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes .  she is a porn star mostly so we know she s slutty , so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted .  attempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up .  these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes .  what happened here ?  the cast is full of likable , promising , young actors ( stiles especially seems to be going places ) .  writer/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off .  in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year s extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences .  the direction is film-school-grad obvious .  it s stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of " cops , " characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion .  plus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera .  this is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she s all that .  if he doesn t start making better choices fast his future films won t be so lucky .

negativeC,' for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated , oversexed , underwritten thrillers .  apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn t change a thing , since body of evidence wasn t written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it .  in other words , it s a ) really dirty and b ) really , really stupid .  madonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job ; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi-naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp .  she s been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover .  already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she s under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men .  what s worse is that the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well .  madonna s character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition .   ( and yes , there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy .  this movie leave no scummy stone unturned . )  anyway . willem dafoe ( very good but completely wasted ) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna s sexuality .  how do we know this ?  because his character is set up with the token wife and kids .  how obvious is it that he s gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up ?  and get kicked out of the house ?  and get welcomed back anyway ?  don t skip to the end yet ; we re just getting warmed up .  dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie .  most of it is about as erotic as open-heart surgery , since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax ( always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don t know the first thing about * really * kinky sex ) and smashed light bulbs .  don t ask .  another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story , it s insanely dull .  what s worse is that body of evidence is dull * everywhere * , not just in the sex scenes .  the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth-hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes .  the thriller business itself is ridiculous -- it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs , and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor .  and the ending -- another homage to eszterhas , maybe ?  -- is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact * frame * where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in .  the director is uli edel , all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f . everyone has to eat , i guess , but this isn t a meal ticket , it s leftovers .

negativeC,' it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable .  the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed .  it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner .  what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 .  what drags braveheart down is its screenplay .  it abounds with high production values : john toll s award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick s 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names .  but this does not save a misguided script .  the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer s only response to his " heroism " is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him .  but wallace s actions paint a different story .  he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance .  though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king .  wallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance .  after kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england .  this is evident of a " spartacus complex " , and this example applies both historically and cinematically .  the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay .  it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film .  horner s score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help .  gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him .  this drags down any emotional connection to the film s plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time .

negativeC,' susan granger s review of " the watcher " ( universal )  just what we need : another lurid , trashy serial killer saga .  this time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking-clock cat-and-mouse game with james spader , a burnt-out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd .  to taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too .  before long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again .  in the midst of this murderous frenzy , there s spader s psychologist , played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in " the cell . "  writers david elliot , clay ayers and darcy meyers , along with first-time director joe charbanic ( helmer of music videos for reeves  band dogstar ) , dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase , revealing , early on , exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop " need each other to give meaning to our lives . "  plus , as reeves explains , " we re all stacked right on top of each other , but we don t notice each other any more . "  after that , it s all sound effects and tricky camera-work , along with a muddled , discordant soundtrack .  james spader s acting technique can be described as  wooden deadpan  while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone  dude  persona which sometimes works , sometimes doesn t .  chris ellis , as spader s self-important colleague , is the only cast member who manages to be convincing .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the watcher " is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 . the real torture is watching it .

negativeC,' ahh yes .  the teenage romance .  an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl .  and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she s all that  last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you  and `drive me crazy  ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity .  along now comes `down to you  .  the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she s all that  craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all .  only `down to you  doesn t have the ? unlikely scenario  mentioned above .  it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we re accustomed to .  this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing .  in strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) .  they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies .  from here , it s the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story .  the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that . . . .  well , only happen in the movies .  fortunately , the cast of `down to you  has a certain appeal .  freddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around .  zak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film s intelligent dialogue .  rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty  ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions  ) and ashton kutcher ( tv s `that 70 s shows  ) .  even the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al s dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray  .  maybe the concept of `down to you  looked good on paper to draw such a crowd .  as a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely .  perhaps worst of all , `down to you  is not funny .  the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired .  the characters on screen , often laughing at each other s goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience .  even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it s course .  the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called `cooks  , a `cops  take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy  families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) .  when this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired .  in order to make a teen comedy work , you ve got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity .  `10 things i hate about you  actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing .  no such luck with `down to you  .  it s just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end .  and at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . .  only in the movies  .

negativeC,'  " virus " is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it .  strangely enough , on the same mid-january weekend last year , another film was released like this , " deep rising , " about an ugly monster on a cruise liner .  prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989 s " leviathan , " 1989 s " deep star six , " and all four " alien " pictures .   " virus , " in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn t include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on .  based on a series of comic books , " virus " concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon .  after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen .  once the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted .  after turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship , and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself .  one survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) , who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out .  if " virus " sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies , you re correct .  although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life , the film itself doesn t appear to have a brain in its head .  the film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the " creature " genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film .  the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past , but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play .  in her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it .  although 1998 s " halloween : h20 " was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here .  donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994 s " the puppet masters , " although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic " invasion of the body snatchers , " where he was fabulous .  the last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do .  basically , " virus " is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one .  it is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ?  as long as some of them keep making money , i suspect the answer is never .

negativeC,' over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind s nuclear testing .  partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo .  a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr .  as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world .  thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 .  now it s 14 years after toho s remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run .  in emmerich s godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms .  when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states .  meanwhile , tatopoulos s college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter .  she d like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break .  of course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor " animal " palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey s trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place .  together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla .  with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation s premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla .  he didn t .  right up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history .  the plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it s up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down .  the script , however , is painfully bad .  it s fraught with lines so corny , they don t even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , " you idiot , " or " you stupid girl . "  i suppose when you ve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well .  why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ?  why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ?  why do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ?  why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ?  okay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll .  broderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he s weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way .  hank azaria does what he can , but don t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage .  like broderick s , azaria s character is quite simply lacking in color .  what really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting .  casting must have been asleep on this one .  the one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we ve seem him do in the past .  although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable .  unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities .  the entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it .  this results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess .  most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously .  although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ?  if we can t take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don t care what happens to them .  godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be .  far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here s a behemoth running through the city !  there s bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i .  joe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm s way just in time .  in a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire .  none of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers .  it s as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie .  consider another punch pulled .  through creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn t just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently .  it made me want to gag .  emmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film .  with an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more .  however , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn t work .  now if they only had raymond burr . . . .

negativeC,' before the remake of psycho appears , we ve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder .  as usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars , and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing .  the film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen )  having fun  in an loft apartment .  the problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) , who is not too happy when he discovers this affair .  if i was paltrow , though , i d definitely go with mortensen .  less wrinkles .  anyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition : he ll pay him to kill his lovely wife .  mortensen agrees , but the murder goes awry , and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses .  unfortunately , the film dosen t progress very fast .  in fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s-l-o-w . )  the plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts .  not too good for a  thriller .    also , the performances , apart from douglas , are below par .  paltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie .  mortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role isn t meaty enough to show all his talent .  which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is does .  however , i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside .  also popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective .  again , it s not a character we re seeing on the screen , it s david suchet .  the director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom-in s , quick cuts , etc . the lighting is also interesting .  however , looks can t save this film from the depths of mediocre , and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway .  the screenplay is o . k , but there s some hackneyed sub-plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched .  the characters also make incredibly dumb moves , especially paltrow , and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel .  with a combination of no tension , drama , or decent characters , a perfect murder is a failure all round , and an incredible disappointment .  there are a few bright moments , but they are far and few between .  the last thing a thriller should be is boring , and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas , you wouldn t be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder .  overall rating=  review by david wilcock ? 1998   " you know , for kids " - norville barnes '
negativeC,' coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels .  relentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , doesn t want to deal with similar line of work .  divorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz s old cases .  to make things even more interesting , it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation .  fans of the british tv films and mini-series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies .  they both feature vicious psychopathic killers , yet also give a lot of , usually depressive , details about chief investigator s private lives .  this one isn t an exception , but similarities with british television are only in content .  the execution and style is different , which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best .  useless , gratuitous erotica also doesn t help either , obviously making this film longer than it should be .  the actors are good , though - leo rossi is fine as usual , and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career .  signy coleman as dietz s love interest , is , on the other hand , quite miscast .  but she won t have to worry about it in the future career , since relentless 3 wasn t supposed to be anybody s finest moment anyway .

negativeC,' edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back , and like his previous two , it is a working-class relationship picture .  however , unlike his previous work , the film dwells on a more personal story , and with a female protagonist .  and in no looking back , he stumbles , making a slow , boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work .  claudia ( lauren holly ) is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life .  she s at a turning point in her life , and feels as if she s going nowhere .  her boyfriend , michael ( jon bon jovi ) , is broke and in a dead end job .  if she were to marry him , she d never get a chance to escape this town .  enter charlie ( edward burns ) , claudia s old flame .  he skipped town several years before , without any explanations . . . even  for claudia .  he has come back to town to see her , and suddenly she is torn .  should she stay with stable michael , and never escape her hometown . . . or  should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again .  part of the answer lies in the character of her mother ( blythe danner ) , who fell for the wrong man . . . and has spent her life pining for claudia s father to return .  now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes .  at only a little past ninety minutes , no looking back is rather short for its genre .  unfortunately , it seems much much longer .  the storyline is simple and uninspired , and there s a lack of energy to the whole proceedings , which makes the entire drama rather tedious .  edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame .  there s no one to restrain his ego , which reigns unchecked .  he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons . . . yeah ,  right .  lauren holly does what she can with her central character .  but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions . . . and  we never really care .  bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie .  his acting talents are much greater than they might seem , but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with .  there s not much to recommend in no looking back .  it s not that the film is bad . . . it s  simply boring .  there s no zest in any aspect of the film , and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it .

negativeC,' i don t expect much from eddie murphy these days .  for the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another .  such films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures .  the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps .  the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places .  sherman has just invented a new " youth drink " that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time .  janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) .  with love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers .  with some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the " buddy love " link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker .  but one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . .  because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy .  then the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes .  and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ?  the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene .  pure and simple , the klumps is a failure .  its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes .  any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process .  it s more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash .  hey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes .  the characterization of sherman s family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema .  everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough .  the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts .  the father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings .  the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone .  the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood .  sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to .  but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy .  the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct .  and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn t act like this all the time .  the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic .  after a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story .  its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line .  even the best effects can t seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days .  now that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make .  people will be lined up around the block for it .  the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 .  eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he ll play every character in the movie .  i just can t wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself .

negativeC,' brian de palma , the director who bought us carrie , dressed to kill and mission : impossible is back , and has bought all his technical expertise with him .  sadly , he forget to bring a good story and believable characters .  nic cage plays rick santaro , a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne ( sinise . )  an assassination takes place , and santaro tries to peace together how it took place , trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy .  the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together .  however , the film doesn t keep the mystery for long , and once the big  secret  is out concerning kevin dunne , the film is at a dead end .  although there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film , halfway through the film drops dead .  the problem is that de palma doesn t have a strong story or characters to work with .  he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques , but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience , and i quickly got bored .  nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters , but it s no use .  they are boring , faceless , and completely unlikeable .  yes , another problem with the film is that there s no-one to root for .  we re supposed to be on cage s side , because his character becomes nicer throughout the film .  however , his change is sadly unbelievable .  poor gary sinise s character is terrible , who completely changes throughout the start , the middle and the end , in an appalling way .  the film s use of flashback quickly gets boring .  while clever and interesting the first few times , it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go .  they certainly don t increase the tension or suspense of the movie .  there is small thread of suspense running through the film , but it certainly doesn t make this film a powerhouse thriller , rather just a slightly below average one .  the script is lousy and contrived , the characters flat and two dimensional .  certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller .  the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential .  there s a good story buried in snake eyes , it s just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks .  it also gives itself away far too quickly , rather than leaving the big twist for the end .  while the performances are intriguing , especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy  number cruncher  wrapped up in the case , there s no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance , and unless you re a big fan of either cage or flash directing , should be avoided .  a david wilcock review ? 1998   " you know , for kids " - norville barnes '
negativeC,' it s now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james  ( jennifer love hewitt ) best friends .  still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all , she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown .  she can t concentrate on her schoolwork , can t get a good night s sleep , and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club .  everywhere she looks , she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand .  in the first movie , `i know what you did last summer  , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway .  to cover their misdeed , they dump the body into the ocean .  however , he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends .  julie and one other , ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) , survived only to make this dismal sequal .  needing some desparate rest and relaxation , she is elated to learn that her college roommate , karla ( brandy ) , has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island .  accompanying these two girls are karla s overbearing boyfriend , tyrell ( mehki phifer ) and a potential beau for julie .  but was this contest too good to be true ?  the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects .  meanwhile , the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin .  this presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island .  eventually , they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms .  as you might have guessed , somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook .  julie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island ( an eerie touch is when she is singing " i will survive " at the karaoke bar and the words scroll " i still know . . . " ) , but her friends chalk it up to paranoia .  but the body count soon starts to rise , and for julie , it s going to be the worst vacation of her life .  the funny ( yes , i used the word  funny  ) thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling ( maybe it was my giggling ) than i heard screaming .  this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness .  there isn t even any suspense that leads up to the deaths .  here s an appropriate example .  knock-knock .   " housekeeping " , says the diminuitive cleaning lady .  the door suddenly opens up .  slash .  next victim !  is there any reason to go and see this movie ?  not unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90 minutes .  but i do want to say one thing about this movie that satisfied me .  i was thoroughly irritated with tyrell , who incessantly ranted and raved about his sexual libido .  i secretly wished for him to get filleted .  did he get  hooked  ?  well , let s just say that if he didn t , i would give this film a grade of " d " .

negativeC,' lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects .  after the familiar  a long time ago . . . .    opening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game .  the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade .  however , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . )  they also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd )  star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters .  the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic .  the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent .  there s no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is .  the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn t help .  there s no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod .  the script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother .  there s no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it s evident that not much is going to happen .  the two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it .  qui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for .  the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time .  maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only  straight  plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . )  anakin is annoying and unlikeable . ,  instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended .  it s probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed  ani  by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible .  the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him .  although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny .  the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a  pod  racer , because i knew he wouldn t be able to talk for a while .  queen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must  serve her people ,   and go goo-goo over anakin .  again , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here .  the actors don t help the movie much either .  liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible .  mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm .  the casting director must have chose him because he s scottish like alec guinness : there s little other explanation for it .  natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance .  and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice .  there s very little talent evident with him , it s hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there .  he s not even very  cute .    the main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay .  there s nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well .  the cgi takes away much of the human element , however .  the battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers .  episode 1 is just disappointing .  it s got high production values , but little else .  the music is meandering , except near the end .  the plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for .  the effects are nice , but dull .  the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should .  there s an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film .  apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film .  disappointing is barely the word .  rating= '
negativeC,' five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake .  the girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha didn t see that one coming ! ) .  hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r . a . m . r . #  1521 ) .  two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here .  orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two ) .  yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too .  i m telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn t harm him at all !  the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability .  thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film .  the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks .  any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line .  the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens .  there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot .  while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress .  the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager s office .  i m sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible ) .  the script for this film is completely pathetic .  the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible .  the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along .  here is an example of the wonderful dialog .  the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun .  the line is " my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . "  this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy .  now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented .  one comment from an actress is " not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . "  i m afraid folks that this is about as good as they get .  now lets talk about the great special effects for this film .  this obviously wasn t a big concern of the film makers .  the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer s intelligence .  a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie .  are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ?  the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film .  in one shot , actress has cloths on , camera angle changes , actress seems to have lost clothing .  very impressive trick !  the one ( half ? )  plus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious .  the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film .  however , this doesn t make it worth the rental fee of over a penny .  in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down .  i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least .  oh well , win some , lose some .

negativeC,' the first film produced by adam sandler s happy madison production company ( clever title eh ? ) is essentially a one joke movie , much like the movies sandler stars in himself .  however the difference here is that this one joke just isn t very funny .  rob schneider stars as the title character , a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a " man-whore " to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client s custom made fish tank , which deuce destroyed while staying in his home .  deuce goes on numerous " dates " , and each woman he goes out with has a " humorous " quirk about herself .  one has narcolepsy , one has tourette s syndrome , one is a man . . .  etc . etc .  my problem is that we see all of these women in the film s trailer , so why do i need to watch the movie ?  seen the trailer . . .  seen the film .  only a quick cameo from norm macdonald ( and a follow up joke during the closing credits ) generates any chuckles .  deuce bigalow : male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video ( a division of di$ney ) .  the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and features the original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for mystery alaska , happy texas , and outside providence ) , an extremely brief production featurette ( which contains footage not used in the film ) , and storyboard-to-scene comparisons .  yep , you read that right . . .  there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd .  two scenes are storyboarded . . .  neither of which are particularly exciting .  there are fight scenes in this movie , so why aren t we seeing storyboards of those segments ( especially the parody moments from the matrix ) ?  i wonder what s funnier : the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di$ney thought fans of this film would want to see them ?  deleted scenes ?  sure .  audio commentary ?  you betcha .  but storyboards ?  come on .

negativeC,' tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie .  the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it s evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster .  enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious .  the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium .  tectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences .  it s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , " look !  art ! " ) ,  although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters .  because we re constantly made aware that we re watching a play or a movie , it s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer s ideas .  they re not real , sympathetic , or believable .  i m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success .  tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) .  one day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself .  while preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision .  meanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host .  with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else .  however , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers .  the tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious .  tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point .  there are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren t bilingual ) .  the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it s different , ( b ) it s not like anything they ve seen before , and ( c ) it s pretentious .  for everyone else , it s not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage .

negativeC,' various films seen at the seattle film festival :  it s all true/three men on a raft ( u . s . a . , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles  a recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle s planned " docu-drama " of amazing stories around the world named it s all true , this short dealt with welle s attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft .  while several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle s attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set .  impressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians .  sadie thompson ( u . s . a . , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play " rain " , based on w . somerset maugham s story " miss thompson " cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent  after the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra s lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago .  this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story " miss thompson " .  this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script .  the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie s soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel .  swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie .  unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script .  the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham s short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we ve been waiting an hour and a half for .  still , it s entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore s incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds .  a c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it .  the pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza  this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids .  it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it .  perhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn t show capitalism in a good light .  nor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter .  as you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over .  not that it wasn t interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done .  all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats .  boy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn t it ?  add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night .  some gore .  don t bring children to this one .  don t bring adults to this one , unless they re fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped .  blech .   . no fun whatsoever .  meier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled  this film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money .  his uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans .  meier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany .  after a round-the-world trip ( his boss think s he s on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew s work--while everyone think s he s still living in east germany .  of course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there .  the humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) .  still , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny .  c -- $2 . 50 .  the right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements  after a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i ve learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to :  1 ) be wary of french comedies .  these people like jerry lewis .  2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait .  3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as " old pouty-lips " is probably not worth watching .  4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out !  australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task .  well , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards .  it s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30 s about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses .  lots and lots of horses .  the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir .  unfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident .  highlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor s daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it s raining--you d think a woman studying medicine would know better ) .  the photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway .  actually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that s life .  grade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you re looking for inadvertent yuks .

negativeC,' capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension .  alien 3 ( the " 3 " should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen .  it continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her .  in fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it s so elegaic and limp .  a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning .  at the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home .  unfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod .  the pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent .  ripley lives through the crash ; the others do not .  the prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it s been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against .  lice are endemic , and so ripley s head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) .  at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it doesn t stay that way .  one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck .  worse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated .  what s weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc . sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack .  the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they re not asked to do anything with it .  in light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie .  it s strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn t have driven the rest of it .

negativeC,'  " from the director of " the nightmare before christmas " it said in the previews , which i m guessing was said to get people to go see the movie , obviously it hasn t worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million .  to each it s own however , since " monkey bone " is not only a bad movie all together , but technically well-made .  a tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects .  stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena " monkey bone " a crude comic strip , that everyone wants to merchandise , they go to great links to get it as well , including dollars that let out fart powder .  when stu and his girlfriend , julie ( bridget fonda ) are in a freak car accident ( you ll see ) stu goes into a coma , and while in his coma stu travels to i m guessing dark town , where all the characters in dreams come to life .  people are stuck in this town , with their nightmares roaming around them .  when stu spots monkey bone ( whom he really can t stand ) he tries to keep him under control .  making a new friend kitty ( rose mcgowan ) he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death , he can go back up and live his life .  when monkey bone and stu steal a pass , monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stu s body .  now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder , so everyone has nightmares . . . or  something like that .  rather complex ( in fact more than it needs to be ) " monkey bone " had potential in the script and even the story .  what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes , and lack of character development .  for instance we really don t get to know who stu or julie are , so why should we even care ?  kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her , but we are not given a chance to know her .  the cast is decent however , brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley , but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body .  bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt , her performance is bad and she seems miscast .  dave foley isn t given enough to do , as well as " will & grace s " megan mullally who can be funny .  the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself , he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust .  the special effects of " monkey bone " is what might really bring in some curious viewers , these special effects are highly effective , and nice to look at with the eyes .  some of them are believable and some unbelievable . . . for  monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little , you really don t realize that he is animated . . . but  on occasion it sneaks up on you .  the direction by henry selick is good , but at times he doesn t know what kind of film he wants to make , and the ending climax falls off the cliff .  it s too bad really , " monkey bone " could have been a real good movie , but with it s heavily done hack job , and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role .  for those curious however , it might be worth the rental , but other than that avoid this one .

negativeC,' numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers .  soldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring .  the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground .  besides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age .  the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography .  russell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad .  besides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience .  this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth .  although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still a long way from anything considered desirable .

negativeC,' a documentary from the twin hughes brothers , allen and albert ( dead presidents , menace ii society ) , about street pimps , all of whom are african-american .  an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession .  it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho s , and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be , is what you get .  i learned that the word " bitch " is their favorite word , as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used .  it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing .  they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen , in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money .  it s also a power trip , accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them , mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place .  this sleazy pic , soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears .  these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face .  the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models , the feather-hatted , fur-coated , diamond ring-wearing , gold chain wearing , flashy cadillac-cruising pimp of the late  70s blaxploitation movies--like the mack and willie dynamite .  also used as reference , was iceberg slim s best-seller pimp , the story of my life .  we meet pimps such as : fillmore slim , c-note , charm , k-red , gorgeous dre , bishop don magic juan , and rosebudd .  they readily discuss their business arrangements : including percentages , lifestyles , knockin ( stealing another pimp s ho ) , and the thrill they get from women giving them money .  these dudes needed no prompting to talk , as they just love to brag about about themselves .   " priests need nuns ,    yaps c-note , a san francisco pimp .   " doctors need nurses .  so ho s need pimps .     as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make ; that the girls need them to show them the ropes , how to make money , to be their security blankets , protectors , and counselors .  the race issue was brought up right from the film s onset , as a number of white interviewees , regular citizens , note that their impression of a pimp , is that he s the lowest form of human .  while , we are told , in the black community , the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur , riding around in fancy cars , flashing wads of money , dressed in a flamboyant style , where his snake-gaiter shoes might cost him a grand , and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community .  we also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt , as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery , of master and slave relations .  the film was all about pimp style and their projected image , as they run a hard-sell riff about the virtues of their work .  there are different styles of pimping , but the film mentions them only as being " macks " and " players " or " real pimps " and " perpetrator pimps , " but no further clarity is attempted .  it is also failed to get the women s side to this story of abuse , primarily taking the pimp at his word .  the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does , as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps , who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing , hungry for their 15-minutes of fame .  the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to .  danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp s wardrobe .  while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd , married his ho and turned square , working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer .

negativeC,' gord brody ( tom green ) is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still lives in parents jim ( rip torn ) and julie s ( julie hagerty , " airplane " ) basement .  as dad declares all out war , gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory in far off la and sets off to make his dreams come true .  gord doesn t make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with fawning mom and outraged dad in " freddy got fingered . "  tom green cowrites ( with " tom green show " scribe derek harvie ) , directs and stars in what is essentially tom green s primal scream .  so , if tom green screams in an empty theater , does he make a sound ?  it s clear that " freddy got fingered " is at least partially autobiographical and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad ( mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks ) .  while this may be of interest to his hard core fans , there s little about green s mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else .  the film starts promisingly enough , with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols   problem  ( green s put together a first rate soundtrack ) and yes , i laughed a few times .  green s flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to draw , make music and eat at the same time ( the  daddy would you like some sausages  scene repeatedly shown in the film s trailer ) are inspired comedy .  but what s funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap ?  a baby delivery bit shows some groan-inducing promise until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs .  younger ( by three years ) brother freddy s internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing but confirm one s worst fears regarding the film s title and green s infamous  handling  of a real horse , while not nearly as shocking as it would seem , doesn t make sense .  by the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film s end , the overall effect is numbness .  while " freddy got fingered " has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a child s self esteem , it s essentially a whole lot of tom green running around being noisy .  rip torn , what were you thinking ?

negativeC,' much ado about nothing .  ah , how sweet the irony !  it s accepted wisdom in some circles - among english literature nuts , mainly - that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance .  he just doesn t " understand " shakespeare , you will hear them say .  the bard s work is apparently beyond criticism .  what a load of old cobblers .  if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh s film of shakespeare s " comedy " much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word , it s time to get a life .  get monty python .  get woody allen .  get john waters .  whatever .  just get a real taste of some clever , witty , risky comedy .  and banish this nonsense to where it belongs .  drama and tragedy was shakespeare s strength .  to my sensibilities - and i m no stick in the mud - much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever .  no kidding : this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going .  the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend , as this was our day out and i hadn t seen her in ages .  but boy , does she owe me one !  i won t spend too much time on the plot .  basically , we follow the trials and tribulations of two would-be couples - one young , the other older .  there s some dark treachery amongst all this , but everyone is so awfully jolly that you d hardly know it .  mind you , there s nothing wrong with the basic story .  good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound .  nothing wrong with most of the cast , either .  branaugh , emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers .  the problem is the script , or more accurately , shakespeare s original text .  light comedy shouldn t be complex .  yet wrapped in elizabethan english , the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend .  for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good , undemanding laugh .  the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves , the actor once again miscast as a jealous half-brother or something .  but when dissected and understood , what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame .  this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold .  ho , ho , ho , boy likes girl !  ho , ho , ho , men are such klutzes !  ho , ho , ho , she s so awfully clumsy !  oh please !  there s wit in here somewhere , i m told .  i call it pretentious .  something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay .  in the end , it s cringeworthy .  watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience .  comedy ?  bah , humbug ! '
negativeC,' another formula  feel good  quirky comedy from the british isles , much like " waking ned devine , " and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line .  it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin .  the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol .  the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas .  but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message .  its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the  war on drugs  is about to be escalated into colombia .  the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america s jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america s drug usage and drug supply .  billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country .  everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war .  the film s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never .  there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether .  the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide .  the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined .  he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage .  the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless .  she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) .  what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her .  even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures .  her gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing .  since she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use .  the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff .  for grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) .  the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace s greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can t control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation .  the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn t want matthew to end up in jail .  it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail .  the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity .  the film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity .  things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood .  there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded .  this  unhip  film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute .  ummm !

negativeC,'  " love to kill " starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes .  at the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who s an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman .  danza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his .  everything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs .  much confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza s begin to emerge , all after one thing or another .  sound confusing ?  it is .  i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity .  in some respects , it works .  but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess .  characters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen .  the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman s sister .  but so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don t really care what happens to them .  well , i didn t , at least .  one thing i will give the movie is that it s a complete departure for tony danza .  here s a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who s ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing .  here , he plays a man who s just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it .  i was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona .  michael madsen is also good as an associate of danza s who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him .  like i said , it s not exactly a linear storyline .   " love to kill " should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre , but it s just too bad that the story doesn t really add up to much .  the stars deserved better , and so did the audience .

negativeC,' warning : spoilers are included in this review . . .  but it doesn t really make much of a difference .  deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 .  remember when dante s peak came out in february ?  a few months later , volcano was released .  the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen .  the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent .  well , it s deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition .  this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july .  of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante s peak .  but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film .  apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me .  to be completely honest , i haven t had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life .  volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch .  deep impact doesn t just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot .  the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters .  deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) .  a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above .  among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) .  leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds .  he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident .  a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again .  we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc .  she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) .  she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie .  after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help .  luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain " ellie " that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . .  that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) .  before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road .  they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) .  beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference .  naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question .  and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive .  they announce a plan called " ark , " which is their only hope for survival .  a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random .  these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won t kill off the entire human race .  after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over .  the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning .  jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom .  the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional .  it s a shame that nothing else is heartfelt .  now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface .  the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it !  by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won t work .  director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show " er . "  her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film .  well , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one .  suggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre .  much of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off .  throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) .  it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it s that boring .  of course , leder isn t all to blame for it .  screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time .  what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) .  chock full of cheesy one liners ( " you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! " )  and stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again .  only one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring .  and the main plot is so outrageous that you can t figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi .  to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation .  that s right , 80% miss , and 20% hit .  scenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic .  but the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening .  the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that s forgiveable .  what isn t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface .  give me a break , will ya ?  and of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth .  well , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant .  the water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous .  cgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks .  in fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days .  just when we think visual effects can t be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be .  one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder s direction , which also influences the actors .  leder loves to show the actors  faces before and during moments of terror .  this reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) .  but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations .  leder likes to flaunt people s fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist .  one moment has an astronaut flying off into space .  this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person s face while drifting into space .  this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled .  on another note , leder s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts .  the pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown .  then again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it s obvious it will be emotional .  it s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into " feeling " for the characters , but it didn t work for me .  but anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given .  t ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv s " the naked truth " ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role .  her character is made stronger by leoni s presence , and we grow to care for her .  robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot .  elijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn t had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama !  you are too talented for this stuff ) .  vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen .  maximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor .  morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) .  leelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character .  a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby .  eldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot .  crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv s " star trek : the next generation . "  seeing her was one of the highlights of the film .  overall , a very talented cast virtually wasted .  deep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language .  this is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever .  luckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful .  it s a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn t worth much .  costing nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience .  well , it s not .  when the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it . '
negativeC,' my first press screening of 1998 and already i ve gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list .  what an auspicious beginning !  welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere .  firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves s academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year s crop of movies .  as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are " smokejumpers . "  we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from " cosmopolitan . "  having the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest .  when , even in the beginning , the director can t get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble .  with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles .  not bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people .  miraculously , they manage to hear her and move away .  in a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building .  as it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl s face .  our show s two heroes , the crew s chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl .  in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames .  the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse .  this mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make .  the chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group .  will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica s two firefighting buddies ?  she has only seconds to decide who will be saved .  yes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway .  not content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth s screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape .   ( " hoods in the woods , " is what the " ground-pounders " yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . )  along the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor .  most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing .  he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck .  arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside .  using a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building s attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust .  when the film isn t using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey .  editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions .  the ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie .  perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , " it s not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . "  firestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 .  it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . '
negativeC,' ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking .  these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous .  if it s not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect .  hackers is guilty of all of these crimes .  to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can t take it anymore .  those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled " goofs " .  this is the section for mistakes in the movies .  well , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : " generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology " .  and truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct .  the plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking .  more specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller .  miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers .  the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems .  he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old .  the film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer .  dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi .  oh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film .  really , i can t think of much more to say about the film s plot aside from what i ve said .  it s just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi .  thanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do .  this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time , and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list .  to sum it up , hackers is a terrible computer film .  if you re looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers .  although at times it too may seem a little far fetched , it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users .  hopefully , this film didn t influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time . '
negativeC,' if there s one thing i just can t stand , it s a film that oozes with sentimentality .  here s a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves .  swelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless .  alas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up .  what reminded me was that i wasn t choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter .  my giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word " cute " but i ve chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a " cute " film here ) .  it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience .  maybe it will work for some people .  it didn t work for me .  billy crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania .  he s in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film .  the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall .  his name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he d be a great movie star because of his size .  subplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he s never around for them , so they move to chicago .  max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins .  sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved .  sam is broke .  max is dying .  pass the kleenex .  my giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny .  it has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself .  in one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn t believe that he s actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) .  crystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he s countered by a slew of jokes that aren t funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes .  muresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can t act very well .  quinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents .  she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff .  here , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent .  all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre .  as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings .  sam s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) .  later , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam s reunion with his family .  and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) .  it s icky .  it drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions .  my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film .  more importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is .  instead , it s a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears .  and since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world . '
negativeC,' this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash .  this is more about a parable of greed , and how money can become the bane of your life .  yes , there are elements of ? fargo  here ( the snow and cold ) , although not as vivid in the blood and gore department .  it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives .  and how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty .  although in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way .  this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there .  the characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk , brothers and friends , who all fall prey to the avarice of money .  they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible , level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance .  commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton , whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful .  bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother , whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife , who indirectly causes the most problems .  fill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars , and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath .  it s not a simple plan , when you shoot everyone you love for money , unless you re the menendez brothers .

negativeC,' based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won t bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) .  can you say . . . the  third times not a charm ?  plot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation s top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week .  critique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture .  when you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that s not a very good sign .  i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes .  when you consider that the other " part " of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign .  and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this " big " summer blockbuster .  it blows .  or as they say in french , " eet blows " .  could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ?  maybe .  could it be that most of the special effects don t show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don t see anything that its trailers hadn t already given away ?  perhaps .  or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ?  naaaaaaah !  a bad movie is a bad movie .  on a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in .  branagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that s pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped .  smith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others .  i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie .  then again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh  yeah , but the rest of the movie sucked .  little known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all-time top grossing films worldwide : 1997 s summer blockbuster men in black ( 7/10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy-winning title song , and 1996 s independence day ( 6/10 ) .  he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career .  kevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama , and has been married to the cute-as-a-button actress phoebe cates since 1989 .  they have two kids together , greta simone and owen .  one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has " kasdan " written on it .  lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss .  salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english .  she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders  mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez s desperado opposite antonio banderas .  since then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez s films .  she stands 5 2 " , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother .  one of the actresses cast as branagh s lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling , a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner ( 7/10 ) .  another is dutch-born frederique van der wal , who is one of the world s most recognized supermodels , having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times , as well as harper s bazaar , vogue and mademoiselle .

negativeC,' in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real-life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa .  the twilight murders , another one from the series , is dealing with the case of gordon kahl ( played by rod steiger ) , old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u . s . government .  after being released , he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest .  when the u . s . marshals come to arrest him , it turns out that kahl isn t alone .  many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti-government beliefs , and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that .  that brings fbi on the scene , and agent mayberly ( michael gross ) is supervising the manhunt .  however , his efforts seem fruitless , since kahl still has many supporters , some of them even in the local law enforcement .  after betrayed , 1988 thriller by costa gavras , hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right-wing extremism in the american northwest , and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing , when media hype brought right-wingers back into spotlight .  until that time , only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon .  unfortunately , the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film , that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script .  sometimes , like many american tv movies , it creates drama where drama shouldn t be .  on the other hand , film is steadily directed by dick lowry , and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl .  on the other hand , michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible .  however , film does deal with potentially thought-provoking social and political issues , so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn t be the total waste of time .

negativeC,'  * * * the following review contains spoilers * * *   " it s just . . .  the way . . .  we are . "  --- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl s ( helen slater ) query as to why she s being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl .  i ll admit it . . .  i love superman iii .  i know it s hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it s a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise .  supergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series  same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn t even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii .  supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time .  as the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in " inner space " , go about their daily lives .  ok . . .  what ?  so these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ?  were they living there before krypton exploded ?  how do you get to " inner space " ?  this whole " inner space " notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world .  how do they know where superman went ?  how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ?  these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me .  argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron .  one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o  toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman s cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art .  kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of " whatever " that protects the city .  in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death . . .  in three days time , or something .  kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world .  the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) .  selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination .  selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she s arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) .  supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives .  ok . . .  huh ?  why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ?  attention movie : explain yourself !  i m sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much .  i can t buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to .  knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically " wills " herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school .  she s given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ?  lois lane s sister , lucy .  ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we re getting really contrived now .  what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . .  complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) .  best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks .  at this point i m rapidly wondering why i m bothering with this nonsense .  there is some credit to give to the film however .  one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an " evil " bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its " prey " is very well done .  also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools .  hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara s love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film s more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some " menacing " bumper cars ) .  then there were numerous little things that bothered me .  the flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . .  it s all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires .  instead of having her look like she s flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be " graceful " , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers .  also , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ?  a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a " wacky " demise .  there is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye s , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) .  finally , just one word : monsters .  faye dunaway and peter o toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o toole overacts he s entertaining and when dunaway does it she s annoying ( her character actually says the line " seize them ! "  at one point ) .  dunaway s henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty s otis character from the first two superman movies .  helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she s written to be , as she s able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable .  believability aside though , it s still annoying .  now despite all this negativity ( and i m not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd !  they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . .  yet i m still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) .  the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters .  the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory .  extras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and " special project consultant " scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries .  the transfer on this international version is incredible . . .  you d think you were watching a new release .  images are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts .  only some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn t much that can be done about that ( unless you re obsessive like george lucas ) .  the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you ll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams  classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films  golan-globus production ) .  the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries .  bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there s no dead air on the track .  bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation .  although , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn t get that response .  we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the " almost " appearance in the film by christopher reeve .  great detail is given about superman s proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out .  as it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission .  for the sake of brevity , i won t even get into that one .  szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy " whimsical fantasy " nonsense .  bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office .  again , for the sake of brevity , i won t even get into that one .  anchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set .  disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release .  disc two features the never before seen director s cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long .  the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don t add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o toole s screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) .  the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won t care .  one question though . . .  shouldn t the director s commentary be on the director s cut of the film ?  i d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd .  i was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it .  so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect .  i knew the film wasn t beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc .  as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong .  come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . .  so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started .  at the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city .  ugh , i give up .  i m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs .  supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie .

negativeC,'  " practical magic , " is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one .  the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens , two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches , spanning back 200 years .  at the start , their parents die when they are still children , and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest ) .  switch to the present day , gillian , who is the stronger , more rebellious sibling , leaves home , and meets up with a dark , abusive guy ( goran visjnic ) , while sally stays in their hometown , meets and falls in love with a sweet , caring man , has two children , and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it , she s not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes ) .  when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic , they accidentally murder him , and in desperation , bury the body in the backyard of their aunts  house .  add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism , not to mention a spattering of " light-hearted whimsy , " and you have a pretty good idea how messy " practical magic " is .  after seeing the film , i reflected that there was not even one scene , or element , that i liked or enjoyed .  it is a comedy , to be sure , but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat , and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching .  it is not charming or entertaining in any way .  and then to top it off , we ve got this dark , but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian s body .  whatever .  the characters are handled terribly , and actually , most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character .  there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film , and in every scene involving them , they are always standing side-by-side .  no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people .  the same goes for aidan quinn , as a handsome police investigator , who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock , even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark , and once again , there is no attempt to develop their relationship , or his character , in any way .  in fact , every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along , rather than getting to know the people saying the lines .  i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits , when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman , who managed to destroy the " batman " series with " batman forever " and " batman and robin . "   " practical magic " is directed by griffin dunne , primarily an actor , who last year made the contrived , clumsy romance , " addicted to love , " with meg ryan and matthew broderick .  i disliked that movie quite a bit , but since " practical magic " is even worse , that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is .  i d tell him to quit while he s ahead , but in these last two years , he s ultimately already buried himself .

negativeC,' nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre -- " frankenweenie , " " beetlejuice , " " batman , " " edward scissorhands , " " ed wood , " " mars attacks ! "  -- yet none of them have been horror films .   " sleepy hollow " is his first attempt to actually scare people .  i greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton s whole career seemed to be leading up to this .  i left disappointed .  andrew kevin walker s screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story " the legend of sleepy hollow . "  in the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors .  ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders .  several of the town s leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman .  although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning .  he also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret .  along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) .  my reaction : ho-hum .  the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting .  that in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages .  however , burton s attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy .  it might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal .  along the same lines , it doesn t help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue-in-cheek tales from the crypt tv series .  a witch s eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit s , a tree spurts blood like it s in a monty python sketch , and the headless horseman .   .   .  well , he s a guy without a head .   .   .  on a horse ( boo ! ) .  the performances are also awful .  although he s impressed me with his work in other films , depp doesn t seem to know what to do with ichabod , and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that s supposed to pass for an 18th century accent .  ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic , which guarantees that we won t sympathize with her character .  the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish .  the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee , martin landau , and christopher walken .  i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola s projected series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only " bram stoker s dracula " and " mary shelley s frankenstein . "  coppola is an executive producer for " sleepy hollow , " and the script reflects his interest in early forms of " moving pictures , " particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion .   ( there s a bird on one side of the card , a cage on the other .  when the card is flipped rapidly , the bird appears to be caged . )  bottom line : the hollow isn t the only thing that s sleepy . '

negativeC,' note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species .  squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley s a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain t ) .  miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they d dare tempt fate and go for another round .  so here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid .  the film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can .  in other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there s a catch -- he s an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who s now infected with alien dna .  patrick s overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring .  and when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick s primary focus turns to her -- " if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable " warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction .  species ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around .  however , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered .  mr . brancato s original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches .  like the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious .  last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- " something bad happened here . "  this time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter " this is awful . "  and she s not even empathic !  and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who s telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , " he s going to rape her . "  while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own .  there s an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn t really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( " he s in aisle 1 ! "  informs eve ) .  if the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion .  much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief .  the implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve s brain ?  why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ?  my favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks .  this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it s being foisted upon the public .  returning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there s realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis .  mykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick s neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film .  mr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) .  ms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that " she s so empowered . "  a lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that s * what i call empowerment . '
negativeC,' the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it s association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks .  tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive .  this time , he s after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he s been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail .  what follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane .  when comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior .  but even on it s own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie .  while the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film s overlong running time .  while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it s trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately .  to be honest , i couldn t care less if snipe s character got captured or not .  snipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i ll explain later .  tommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge .  the sense of deja vu was overwhelming .  i know it s the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film .  there s a few  nudge nudge  references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing .  nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie .  downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who s roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife .  nobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot .  the supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it s face .  it doesn t fare any better plot-wise , either .  the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory .  as said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional .  if this film wasn t the  sequel  to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it s so average .  and because of the film s plot changing it s course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie .  stuart baird , the director , is all right , but there s no particular scene that stands out .  it s director is the usual action movie style .  even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension .  the special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there s a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith .  but in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement .  sure , it s loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain t fun .  bored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie .  overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities '
negativeC,' one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton s 1925 silent film seven chances .  now i ve never seen seven chances , as i m more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this .  o donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company .  he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he s unwilling to marry her .  his reasons ?  well he s a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don t like to be roped or something ( hey , that s the movie s explanation . . .  i d marry renee zellweger in a second ) .  eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it s the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever .  he essentially says to her , " you win " and hands her a ring .  the audience should now hate this character .  i did .  then the meat of the plot presents itself .  jimmie s grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business .  however , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) .  having blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a " business proposition " .  the movie wasn t half bad by this time , surprisingly .  it wasn t boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point .  ustinov s character left a video will , and while he s reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself " what is this , brewster s millions ? " .  as soon as i thought it , hal holbrook s character actually says " what is this , brewster s millions ? "  it was quite surreal .  something happens though during the film s final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive .  up to that point , all of jimmie s prior girlfriends had turned down his " business proposition " which i felt was good .  at least the film wasn t painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers .  when jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story .  at this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride .  these women arrive at jimmie s location and immediately start bullying him about what he s looking for in a woman .  when he s had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there s been a mistake and he won t be marrying any of them .  as a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off .  this goes on for the rest of the film .  it s just chris o donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women .  my groans of disgust could be heard for miles .  the film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day i m still groaning .  the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video .  it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd-rom features .  the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film .  apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o donnell around the city , and at one point o donnell is leaping from the tops of buses .  so that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ?  ugh .

negativeC,' the happy bastard s quick movie review  holy man  more like holy crap .  the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical-ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston ) with a flat tire on their hands .  somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel , a line-up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white , morgan fairchild , and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures .  it s here that he seems to hit his stride , speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales .  at this point in the movie , of course , morality comes into play , particularly on goldblum , who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss ( robert loggia ) .  it doesn t take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush , with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points .  only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild s face seems to have any interest in the movie .  murphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he d rather be someplace else .  some may argue that the movie has a message , but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat .  at least he has something for us to laught at . . .

negativeC,' forget get carter .  instead . . .  get me a cup of coffee .  what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ?  did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ?  when did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980 s -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads .  the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don t mean new york city .  get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80 s action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown .  stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up .  a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey .  that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul .  stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past .  too bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges .  get carter is a simple story .  stallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) .  when frank s brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented " carter s way " .  he talks tough with his brother s wife , lends a helping had to his brother s daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee .  carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough .  carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties .  what a minute !  this sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey .  better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off .  actually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) .  while stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose .  throughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously .  his one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character .  there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words .  the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke .  an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character .  he may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book .  get carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud .  the only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting .  never mind that it should never have been made at all .

negativeC,' a remake of the 1978 warren beatty vehicle " heaven can wait " ( which in turn was a remake of " here comes mr . jordan " ) , " down to earth " tells the tale of lance barton ( chris rock , " lethal weapon iv " ) , a young black standup comic trying to win over the audience at harlem s apollo theater .  when he s taken to heaven prematurely by bumbling angel keyes ( eugene levy , " best in show " ) , his only recourse is to return in another body .  he chooses that of charles wellington , the tenth richest man in the united states .  of course , wellington is not only rich , but white and 53 years old , which makes lance s bid for closing night at the apollo , as well as his desire to woo suntee ( regina taylor , " jerry maguire " ) , a tad tricky .  the original elaine may/warren beatty script has been reworked by chris rock , lance crouther , ali leroi , and louis c . k .  to turn beatty s vehicle as a football player into rock s vehicle as a comic and add some racial humor .  as directed by chris weitz and paul weitz ( codirectors of " american pie " and costars of " chuck & buck " ) , the whole affair comes off as amateur hour .  initial scenes play like filmed line reading rehearsals .  production values are shoddy .  most serious of all is the use of rock when his wellington counterpart would have been more appropriate .  this problem is clearly attributable to the fact that the old white guy is never lip or action synched when he is on screen .  rock does get the chance to do some fun schtick , such as his turnaround on wellington s plans for a poor neighborhood hospital (  bullet in the head ?  you got a bed !   ) , but he s uneven when interacting with the rest of the cast .  regina taylor fares well amidst the mediocrity as the young activist who confusedly ends up falling for the man she believed to be her nemesis .  also good is frankie faison ( " hannibal " ) as whitney , lance s compassionate manager - the only human who s made privy to lance s body body switch .  chaz palminteri and levy are pretty much wasted as heaven s ambassadors .  another " best in show " alumnus , jennifer coolidge , is poorly used as wellington s cheating wife ( and shown several days apart wearing the same outfit ? ! ) and greg germann ( tv s " ally mcbeal , " " sweet november " ) continues display his sitcom roots as her lover and husband s lawyer .  mark addy ( " the full monty " ) is sorely underutilized as cisco , wellington s fake english butler .  stealing the show in every scene she s in is wanda sykes ( " the chris rock show " ) as wellington s disgruntled maid .   " down to earth " is for chris rock fans only .  all others should go rent " heaven can wait " or truly be brought down to earth . '
negativeC,' what would you do if no one could see you ?  well , if you re a super smart bio-molecular research scientist working for the military , you d grope a co-worker and rough-up your neighbor from across the street .  that s right .  of all the non-criminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible , in " hollow man " kevin bacon s character opts to commit sex crimes .  er , it s kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio-molecular research scientist ?  something sounds horribly wrong already .  but this is a paul verhoeven film , and the sleazepin director of such open-crotch classics as " basic instinct " and the infamous " showgirls " never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which , when you come right down to it , is all this film is about .   " hollow man " features a string of hapless , c-list actors ( among them bacon , elisabeth shue , josh brolin , and kim dickens ) in a grade-z plot with a lot of special effects that , frankly , don t look much better than those used in the 1933 version of " the invisible man . "  oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he s attempting reentry but otherwise it s lots of " thermal " shots and inanimate objects ( elisabeth shue included ) bobbing around without any visible signs of support .  since invisibility , once achieved , isn t much of an effect ( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other--it amounts to much of a muchness ) , the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely-buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon s character gets invisible he can head straight for them .  it s as if that fascinating concept--what would you do if no one could see you ? --is  simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin .  as a horror film , " hollow man " is unsophisticated and disturbing ( in its intent , not its achievements ) and not worth your time or your hard-earned dollars .  it s minor verhoeven--and even that s not saying much--and boy is it hollow .

negativeC,' roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . .  ben kingsley ? "  my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it .  they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles .  the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious .  that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast .  gary " gal " dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain .  life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing .  but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch .  the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa .  the second punch comes from gal s past .  back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv s lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal .  he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal .  don will accept any decision gal makes from " yes " to " certainly . "  however , if gal says " no " don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy s ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) .  in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody s skin .  kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness .  there are some serious problems in louis mellis s and david scinto s script that should have been caught before filming .  when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success .  beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him .  any local hood could have done what gal is needed for .  additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault .  no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool .  in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar .  i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade .  the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability .  the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im .  it is not a great plot .  in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards .  perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film .  it is an old plot dressed up to look new .  if the plot is old , at least the style is creative .  this is director jonathan glazer s first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout .  his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences .  cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes .  we see one side of a person s faces .  but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit .  half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden .  us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog .  at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language .  sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film .  the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western .  further respectability comes from ben kingsley s high-powered performance .  i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

negativeC,' apparantly money talks .   .   .  and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so !  i ve always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess , whether in language , violence , sex , or what have you .  i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard , and money talks definitely does !  it s not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly ( and i mean constantly ! ) , but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged .  perhaps if one character were foul mouthed , but in this film , everybody swears nearly every other word .  money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett ( played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker ) .  franklin is your typical con-man and ends up with more than one person out to get him .  when the plot finally gets underway , there s no less than three people ( or groups ) that want him , dead or alive .  the frenchman who s somewhat responsible for franklin s escape from a prisoner-packed bus , a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand , and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder .  franklin s only hope : james russell ( charlie sheen ) , an investigative reporter for the local news who s out to prove himself a worthy journalist .  james offers to help clear franklin s name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week .  both of these elements are completely lost along the way however , and never do reappear .  as expected , the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end , which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way .  there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film , and so many developments are either non-relevant , or just plain forgotten about .  money talks is a paint-by-numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience .  frivilous dialogue , a predictable , flat storyline , and two-dimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money .

negativeC,' starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see .  therefore , it s with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas .  despite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters .  a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the " savages " that live there .  the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust .  only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash .  the ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film s finer moments .  the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth .  governor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses .  captain john smith is a blond hunk who , while " slightly " misguided , is good at heart .  pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time .  she even comes complete with insignificant best friend .  again , against tradition , talking animals aren t used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is .  this is an odd compromise , but it s one of the few elements that really work .  the animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation .  maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes .  the talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch .  the music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , " colors of the wind . "  mel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more .  the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character .  i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time .  even the children in the audience seemed restless .  while there s no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed .  perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history .  it s all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie s entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn t work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer s minds and plot holes that are never filled .  even the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious .  as mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film .  for instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with " savages , " why did he so quickly change his previous " kill as many indians as i can " attitude .  if he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this .  or how about pocahontas  amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ?  i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway .  as it is , i wonder if it doesn t give kids the wrong impression .  in short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set .  while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels .

negativeC,' when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect .  woody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he s my favorite .  even martin scorsese hasn t had a perfect track record .  kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic " clerks " stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful " mallrats . "  i mean , so far the only director who s made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( " slacker , " " dazed and confused , " " before sunrise , " and " suburbia " . . . all  which were great ) .  now , i adore quentin tarantino .  his first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time .  but 1995 just wasn t that good of a year for him .  he made way too many tv appearances .  he mispronounced jackie chan s name on the mtv movie awards .  and he made this film .   ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception ) .  robert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one .  i ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can t comment on them .  but in this crap ensemble director s film , all four give pitiful efforts .  pitiful for any director , too .  now in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out .  i ve never seen all of " new york stories , " but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody s one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par ) . but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film .  exposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who s a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year s eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel .  he s the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! ) .  the old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily .  as the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile .  yea .   ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) :  the missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt  this one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue .  the situation is so terrible that it s physically painful to watch .  the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! )  stuck inside some object in their hotel room .  the witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it .  yeah , that s what i said .  stupid plot , inane characters who aren t interesting at all , etc , etc , etc . the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully .  not even actually funny for a second .  my rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! !  the wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender  another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on .  ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at " coming back " ) who are playing sex games .  ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon .  but at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much .  and david proval has never overacted as much .  and it s " pulp fiction " producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window .  a masterpiece compared to the first one , but still . . .  the misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek  would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek s navel ?  nope .  luckily she s on the tv dancing so we get to see her .  surprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential .  it was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny .  but when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once .  antonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny .  but , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it s more painful than funny .  but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time .  oh !  the plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year s party .  antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . . . it  was okay .  the man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again )  ironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film .  he plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row .  they re drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn t light .  they also pay him a lot of cash .  this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it s campy .  tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves  cause they ve had hits , major or minor .  it took quentin to realize that .  but the thing is , it doesn t seem like he realizes that .  if he did , i d give this a good 3 stars .  but this sucked .  it was anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn t very good .  he starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes .  that makes no sense .  it s cool for a while , then he makes it uneven .  it s long and it s just not very good .  hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one .  conclusion : what s the moral here ?  if you ve made celebrated films , don t do an ensemble piece .  they should have re-watched " new york stories " and then stopped in their tracks .  none of these have any point to them and they re embarrassing to not only the writer/directors , but to the actors  cause they re working with crap .  but i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin s next directing job ( even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool " from dusk till dawn , " which i found exhilerating ) .  i love quentin and i suppose it s good he made " the man from hollywood " because it makes him seem more realistic and not some " god of cinema . "  i seem to respect directors if they aren t " gods " and are actually human beings who make mistakes .   " the man from hollywood " is his big mistake and let s hope he doesn t return her continuously . '
negativeC,' you don t need to have seen the original " species " to appreciate how utterly lousy " species ii " is .  with few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that " species ii " is a follow-up isn t the only reason it s so miserable .  it s the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction .  the plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle .  the slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black .  that should have been the end of the movie right there .  back on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you ll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate .  on a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again " played " by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing .  this , apparently , includes observing eve s reaction to " the dukes of hazzard " tv show , which she appears to enjoy .  eve s bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk " mates , " which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail , but otherwise there doesn t appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let s hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) .  eve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the finale , but the effects are so messy you can t really see what s going on .  peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams " i told  em not to go ! "  at the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle .  michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox ( so that he can enter high security areas , flash a badge and claim to be press , maybe ? ) , as does marg helgenberger as dr . laura baker , the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns .  they re both unbelievably wooden .  what s a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( " the ruling class , " " the krays , " " let him have it " ) doing directing this tripe , i wonder .  it s an unfortunate trend , this : once-talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like " species ii . "  last year peter hyams gave us " the relic " ; no thanks necessary there .  and the first " species " was helmed by roger donaldson who , although certainly no genius behind the camera , had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects .  is it just that there are no better offers out there ?   " species ii " is worthless .  worse than that , it s also exploitative , offensive , and insulting to the intelligence at every turn .  it s not that there isn t anything positive to say about the film .  there is .  after 92 minutes , it ends .

negativeC,'  " something is fishy in the state of universal . "  about ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post-apocalypse nitty-gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies .  we ve always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on .  to date , the most smoothly done were straightforward " haircuts " of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim .  most of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane .   ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget . )  now we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter .   ( well , she s not a widow , and the kid isn t her daughter , but you get the idea . )  the lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn t given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script .  the child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she outshines her material all the way through .  in simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now .  the polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet .  the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies , and survive by trade , theft , or piracy .  somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries , and its inhabitants , called " smokers , " are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials , so the bad guys have outboard engines , and fast-moving boats , airplanes , and jet skis .  enola , found at sea as a young girl , has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back .  we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical " dryland , " the place where trees , crops , and animals grow , and what plot there is hinges on who has enola .  the psycho ruler of the smokers , the " deacon , " is trying to get her and find his way to dryland .  played with typical self-lampooning , rug-chewing histrionics by dennis hopper , " deacon " is the only thing in the movie that s close to amusing .  his performance is * almost * laughable , but there just isn t enough there to be funny .  the star ( and a co-producer ) is kevin costner .  he s playing an un-named lone denizen of the sea , a man called the " mariner , " who turns out to be a gilled , water-breathing mutant with webbed feet .  very little is done with this .  the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism ; it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted , much of the earth s surface would still be above water ; and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown .   ( canned meat does * not * last for centuries ; ammunition does * not * fire after it s more than a few decades old ; and so on , and so on . . . )  i m quite fond of tina majorino s previous work , very impressed by jean tripplehorn s past accomplishments , and still speechless over costner s dances with wolves .  but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it !  this movie cost one hundred and eighty-two million dollars , and there s * nothing * in it we haven t seen before , done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey .  at 125 minutes of material , this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make .  the budget of this movie * could * have given us over thirty movies ; it could have paid for six years of a prime-time sf tv series with expensive fx work , or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx .  in sum , this movie is beneath contempt .  it has nothing new to offer , it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc , and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation .  if you * have * to go see it , see it on a four-dollar matinee .  otherwise you ll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface , for weeks .

negativeC,' this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation .  but lo and behold , here comes " switchback , " and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as " kiss the girls " and " i know what you did last summer . "  but " switchback " is an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting .   " switchback " opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she s watching .  we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while .  he is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn t keep him from offering pursuit .  lacrosse s most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r . lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man .  in a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado .  along the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto ) .  this tangent isn t a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself .  or is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about .  in a sense , that s half of the basic problem with " switchback . "  for its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we re given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we ll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction .  but " switchback " then decides to explicitly reveal the killer s identity at its midpoint , and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense .  some of the acting is a burdensome area as well , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves .  what is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ?  and dennis quaid ?   ( that monotone -- stop it ! )  ermey is solid in a supporting role that s more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes  object of affection in " my so-called life " ) is a scene-stealer tried and true .  >from a material standpoint , " switchback " is pretty empty .  but even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote " the fugitive " and " die hard " ) doesn t know what to do , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals .  the set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor .  still , that s not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond , and more than the movie s look will end up leaving you cold .

negativeC,' some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others , almost as gifted , have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable .  as was amply evident after basic instinct , sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon .  rejecting her natural abilities , she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type .  gloria is her latest disaster .  babe ruth didn t quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity , and neither should stone reject what she does best .  janeane garofalo , for example , is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone s part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn t do garofalo s comedic roles .  gloria , directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes , was not screened in advance for critics , almost always a sign that the studio isn t behind the picture .  after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened , it is clear why they held it from the press .  it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed .  as the story opens , an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement .  she s got a bad attitude and a big mouth .  she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents , a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast .  an annoying child actor named jean-luke figueroa plays a soon-to-be orphan named nicky .  just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria s ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam ) , nicky s dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin s operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice .   " be a man , " his father lectures him sternly .   " don t trust nobody .  not no broads .  nobody . "  most of the film s leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements .  add in the movie s almost non-existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing , and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones .  lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting .  they stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse .   ( " say you re my baby , " kevin coos demandingly .   " i m not gonna , " gloria pouts back . )  the movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites .  the kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared , no matter how many people are after him with guns , trying to kill him .  and in one key scene , the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied .  gloria , who keeps saying how she hates kids , takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys .  think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends ?  if you don t know the answer , you may be just the right viewer for this film .  you have to say this for stone : she can keep a straight face .  when explaining life to a 7-year-old kid , she says with utter seriousness , " you got a lot of love making to make ; you got a lot of boozing to do . "  gloria runs 1 : 48 .  it is rated r for profanity , violence and brief male nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers . '
negativeC,' susan granger s review of " ghosts of mars " ( sony pictures entertainment )  horror auteur john carpenter ( " halloween , " " vampires " ) strikes out with this sci-fi eco-fable that s so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green-lit .  the script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year s " pitch black , " involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood-thirsty , marauding aliens .  in the year 2176 , there are 640 , 000 earthlings on mars , living in a matriarchal society led by a commander , played by pam grier .  grier , pill-poppin  natasha henstridge , and some rookie mars police officers ( clea duvall , jason statham ) travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch " desolation " williams - that s ice cube - to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder .  but when they re besieged by demented , zombie-like , body-snatching miners , they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection .  it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and , soon after , most of the miners went bonkers as long-dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies , lopping off heads as " vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet , " according to a scientist ( joanna cassidy ) .  carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the " night of the living dead " -like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing .  but you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed , along with the order of their elimination .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " ghosts of mars " thuds to a laborious , bottom-of-the-barrel 1 .  perhaps , indeed , there is a curse on mars films , if you recall two other duds : " mission to mars " and " red planet .

negativeC,' plot : based on the wildly popular " jerry springer " tv show , this movie follows the lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on the infamous program .  one posse comes from the trailer parks and are to be featured in the " i slept with my stepfather " segment , and the other is based on some fly-girl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted " dog " boyfriend .  critique : the truth is that if i didn t have a day job , i would probably watch the real " jerry springer " show every day .  i find it quite entertaining , despite its complete lack of redeeming value .  having said that , the show itself is outrageous , funny , and always filled with goofy surprises , as opposed to this film which features no laughs ( is this a comedy or a drama ? ) , uninteresting and completely unbelievable one-dimensional stereotypes , and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way .  i never thought i would utter the word boring in the same sentence as jerry springer , but this film is an absolute yawn-fest , despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs , lesbians , t&a and tv violence ( who would ve guessed that ? ) .  i wish they would have either a ) made this movie much , much funnier , or b ) turned it into a complete drama and given us a real perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment .  unfortunately , it doesn t seem as though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching real " jerry springer " reruns to complete his script , leaving us with a boring film , featuring no laughs , one-dimensional characters , and no fun whatsoever .  little known facts about this film and its stars : jerry springer used to be the mayor of cincinnati , ohio .  for this film , he won the 1999 razzie award for worst new star , tied with joe esterhas from an alan smithee film : burn hollywood burn .

negativeC,' i never understood what the clich ? " hell on earth " truly meant until very recently .  i ve just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying , so horrible , so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as " hell on earth " .  after all , i ve never been to war , i ve never been the victim of any violent crime , i ve never really been broken hearted , and i ve never been audited ; so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was " hell on earth "  then i saw cruel intentions .  in a perfect world , i would be in charge of all the movie studios .  the very first thing i d do in this perfect world , would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20-something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv , and throw them in jail .  but it wouldn t just be your average jail , not even a maximum security installation .  i d have these producers ( and everyone else involved in the production of these films ) put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity .  now you re probably thinking to yourself : " is this really how bad cruel intentions is ? "  the answer is no .  it s actually much worse .  watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble s awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound .  and then pouring acid on the salt .  i don t know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum ( tara reid ) whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet , but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom .  from that opening scene , where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz , to the conclusion which i don t remember because i had practically fallen asleep ; cruel intentions is truly " hell on earth , " right up there with war and tax audits .

negativeC,' about an hour or so into " the jackal , " a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out " i hope she gets killed now ! "  at that point it hit me : i didn t care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn t really like .  when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he s being played by sidney poitier , you know something s rotten in the state of denmark .  every year , a couple films like this are released .  you know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago .  this was the third one of  97 , following the very lackluster " the saint , " which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun " the peacemaker , " featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain .   " the jackal " tries to mix both elements .  and you thought " the saint " was bad .   " the jackal " is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i ve yet to see , " the day of the jackal , " which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule .  well , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or  is he ?  after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he ll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion .  and like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people .  the agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from " romeo + juliet " ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of  97 ) who s in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever .  soon , he s out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him .  there are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on .  the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue .  sure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register .  the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one .  it doesn t help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances .  the script of " the jackal " is a complete mess , mostly because it can t decide what it wants to focus on .  is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ?  is it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who s in everything for the money ?  or is it a combination of both ?   " the jackal " aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character .  the connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast .  the worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then .  the supporting characters are worse .  sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable .  what is poitier doing here ?  he s one of the best living actors !  does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ?  diane venora s russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade .  it s not that anyone s bad here ; it s that they have nothing to do .  the plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time .  the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain .  there are several times where he s in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill .  take a scene where he s being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it .  doesn t killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ?  and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ?  geez !  is there anything good here ?  well . . . a  couple things .  i did like willis s icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle .  richard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have .  and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis .  but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is " the jackal . "  director michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior " rob roy " ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way .  every now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( " clear and present danger , " which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but " the jackal " is an example of when they go completely wrong .

negativeC,'  " showgirls " is the first big-budget , big-studio film to receive an nc-17 rating .  and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence .  but if " showgirls " is any indication of hollywood s future , the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values--bad moviemaking .   " showgirls " is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene , and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter .  director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas , who collaborated on another shock-value project , 1992 s " basic instinct , " follow the plight of a young woman ( teen tv star elizabeth berkley ) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer .  it s a hackneyed premise to begin with , so not surprisingly , all of the stock characters are trucked out .  there s the demanding producer .  the loyal friend .  the bitchy competitor .  lest i forget the scummy club owner .  of course , any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film s main attraction--an endless parade of full-frontal nudity .  unfortunately , " showgirls " doesn t satisfy in this department .  verhoeven s slam-bang , in-your-face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic .  to make matters worse , you ll be forced to sit through the movie s clothed scenes , which don t cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history .  verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground , but if it s adult entertainment you want , stay home and watch the playboy channel .  you ll be the wiser for it .

negativeC,' here s a concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie .  now if that isn t enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie , i don t know what is .  all sarcasm aside , it is certainly a different way to start a movie , of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us , we get to see more of jean-claude .  van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives .  van damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france .  the remaining twin ( the french cop ) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death .  once there , he hooks up with his deceased brother s girlfriend , played by natasha henstridge , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are .  jean-claude s acting abilities don t seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie .  in other words , just in case you missed the sarcasm , his acting is worse than normal .  on the upside , natasha henstridge is in this film , and she does what she did best in species -- she gets naked .  sadly , this is probably the high point in the movie .  she is actually a decent actress , but didn t improve as much as i thought she would after species .  this is the typical van damme movie , with jean-claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents .  nothing new here , and certainly nothing we haven t seen in every other van damme movie .  simply put , there is absolutely nothing new about this movie .  it has a retread plot -- this isn t the first time jean-claude has played twins .  he still can t act .  we all saw natasha s breasts in species ( although this is one repeat performance i m not complaining about ) .  this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in -- sub par .

negativeC,' what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project .  most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films .  john frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60 s , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin .  screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd .  ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes .  even charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn t act , did a decent job in cider house rules .  when all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining .  after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration .  the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining .  the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are .  it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights .  we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar .  the actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun .  reindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don t seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn t look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest .  evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled " boy this movie is horrible ! "  and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments .  the story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) .  nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person .  when nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays .  unfortunately ashley s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship .  thinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard .  now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel .  confused ?  the movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax .  but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour .  the hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley .  some hero .  the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire .  when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times .  the most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason .  the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead .  the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food .  why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me .  why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me .

negativeC,'  ( dreamworks skg ) running time : 2 hours starring robert duvall , tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair .  elijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth .  tea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth .  also featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny s father and mother .  while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one .  the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all .  only the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters .  and because i couldn t care for them , i didn t really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not .  the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements .  mimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in a ho-hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame .  the cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good .  she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist .  robert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money .  elijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is surprisingly average , although his choice of roles lately haven t exactly been brilliant ( i . e .  flipper , 1996 ) .  his role is also vastly underwritten .  morgan freeman , again , is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role .  like duvall , he just seems to be in the film for the money .  the supporting cast are all o . k , none making much of an impression .  ok , so deep impact may have messed up character wise , but surely the special effects are good ?  well , yes and no .  although the special effects should be impressive , with a massive tidal wave destroying new york , the special effects look like , well , special effects .  sadly , the waves looks like it s been drawn on computer , and doesn t look too good at all .  surprising really , when the effects are done by industrial light & magic , who did the effects for the lost world and twister .  in the end , deep impact is a wasted opportunity .  what could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects .  the 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect .  once again , dreamworks has churned out another average movie .  let s hope armageddon is a bit better .  overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities '

" lost in space " is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre .  it s made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for .  audiences  attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has " star wars " written all over it ) , but as the producers  way of showing off their budget through the special effects .  battle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it s impossible to care about anything that happens .  in essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking .  we meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth s behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources .  each member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people .  professor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it s obvious what role this aspect will play ) .  of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are " resolved " at the right moments .  the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it s presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it s laughable .  the first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! ) .  we re provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent .  in fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent .  yes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk .  they say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it s the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) .  it s amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens .  eventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not .  the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage .  what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts .  the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as " alien " -lite .  the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive .  but there s never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly .  plotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario .  the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it s presented in such a ridiculous way it s utterly boring .  by the time the last act rolls around , there is no sense of a payoff building .  the ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) .   " lost in space " is major film production at its worst .  it s frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment . '
negativeC,' the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could ve been effective .  such is the case with _urban legend_ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks .  the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends .  examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house .  the killer wears one of those l . l . bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up , so you can t see the face .  i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days .  anyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric .  it s a very good setup that promises more chills to come .  unfortunately , the film never takes off from there .  the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus .  like most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac ( or in this case an axe wielding maniac ) .  i ve always wondered why these killers don t save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill .  after the fine first scene , the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just- someone-else scares .  these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music .  i guess sudden , sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days .  the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast .  the slasher appears , attacks , the victim is eviscerated , and the tedious cycle appears anew .  false scares should always be used in moderation .  someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren t as scary as they used to be .  this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit--it s not frightening .  remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ ?  this movie still adheres to them .  tons of illogical moments about ; more than i really have the inclination to list .  and i don t mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense .  that type of illogical can be fun .  this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember .  the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you ll be laughing more than you ll be screaming .  actually , you won t be screaming at all .  at its best , the acting can barely be called " adequate " and the script could ve definitely used a rewrite or two .  the film still manages to have some strong points .  the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans .  there are some intentionally funny moments .   ( these were exceeded by the unintentional ones . )  the film is well made from a technical standpoint .  besides the first part , there is also another good scene , a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station .  if there had only been more sequences like this , that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music , _urban legend_ might ve been worth your money . '
negativeC,' my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love .  i love ralph fiennes .  i love uma thurman .  i love sean connery .  hell , i m even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw .  i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since .  a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground .  then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics .  and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs .  and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique .  my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things .  the film i saw today didn t even meet those expectations .  this is a lousy , incoherent mess .  i would slam it harder , if it weren t for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors .  but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired .  that s the main problem with the avengers : for all it s hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired .  it s like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making .  it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots .  this is just plain depressing .  the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show .  frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i ve never watched an episode .  i wasn t alive then .  i don t even watch television now .  i m very sorry that i don t have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i ve already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse .  i didn t know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles .  i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film .  based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits .  they are to work together , under mother s orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) .  it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather .  his name is de wynter ( connery ) .  he is a crazy scottish guy .  our heroes had better stop him , or else .   .   .  the weather will keep getting colder until they " have to go to hell to warm up " ( one of the film s few funny lines ) .  along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense .  for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos .  now , killer bugs don t really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film .  the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established .  they re never even directly connected to de wynter ( they re controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) .  the special effects aren t bad , but they re loud , obnoxious , and intrusive .  like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning .  and i guarantee you , it will wane .  i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn t do any good to think .  the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn t tell us what happens .  there are several scenes in the preview that didn t make the final cut .  in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) .  the scenes that don t feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast .  they aren t .  the action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film .  they aren t , either .  and what about this wasted cast ?  oh , it makes me weep with disappointment .  we re talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * .  i love the guy .  i ve loved all his films , until this one .  he seems like he wants to understand the film , but he s as lost as we are .  and thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can t manage to look at home here .   ( i don t blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . )  connery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter .  who is to blame ?  is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ?  perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right .  is it the actors ?  for god s sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling .  i blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn t have been given the task to begin with .  his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor .  add to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory .  if the avengers has a saving grace , it s the set design .  the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at .  i like the final set-piece , on de wynter s island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense .  i admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere .  i also enjoyed michael kamen s music score , particularly in the opening credits .  but this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there s a lot more that needs to be here .  inspiration , for instance , would have been really nice .  maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story .  or a sense of purpose .  most of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles .  damn this movie for not giving them the chance . '
negativeC,' if snake eyes were a dog , you d put it to sleep .  if it was a couch , you d put it out on the sidewalk , where it would sit for a week .  if it were your child , you d be reading military school catalogs .  if it were a ship -- no , it wouldn t be the titanic , that would imply glamor and tragedy -- it would be the exxon valdez .   ( personal side note : i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip .  for whatever reason , my hotel s cable system wasn t showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup .  this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective . )  snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater .  snake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where s the manager , and how do i get a re-admit pass ?  if i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent-a-car , can i sue brian de palma ?  is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage s oscar ?  will someone please ( i m begging you ) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents ?  and how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ?  the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer .  if you ve seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate .  the trailer is a work of sheer genius .  it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage s performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot .  the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross .   ( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? )  but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie .  the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match .  unfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot .  the trailer gives away much , too much of the story .  the shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy .  the film s secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is .  without an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level .  as much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit .  de palma is maddeningly inconsistent .  he can , on his day , create amazingly well-done movies ( the untouchables , carlito s way ) .  on off-days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain ) .  snake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school degree-of-difficulty value .  the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor .  there is a split-screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it s followed by a god s eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that s imaginitively done .  this is what s called giving the devil his due .  but the technical skill doesn t even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie .  placing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years .  snake eyes is a criminal act , an evil waste of time and talent .  cage , sinise , and yes , even de palma deserve better .  the audience deserves better -- but no refund , no re-admit pass , no free popcorn coupon , can ever restore to us the time we ve spent or wash the awful images from our mind .  however , we are left with one consolation , that we were warned by the movie s title -- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps . '
negativeC,' the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , " i think we need a bigger bat cave , " or something to that note .  that s exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much .  cut batgirl out .  cut one of the villains .  it s too much to handle in one dosage .  it s so much that characters get left behind .  poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form .  and elle deserves better .  this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher .  it s also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel ) .  the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel ) .  this one s not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck .  it s up to joel to make it fun though .   " batman forever " was fun .  this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters .  i mean , this one bit .  i m gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr . freeze ( ah-nold ) , who s wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days .  he s a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ?  joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body .  batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they re growing apart .  meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he s used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had .  she emerges from her chemicals ( don t ask  cause i can t tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who s poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people .  she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo .  meanwhile , alfred s dying of the same disease mr . freeze s wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl .  meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman s alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing .  end of her for all we know .  mr . freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don t ask ! ! ! ) .  the trio must team together " as family " to beat them .  there ya go .  not the whole story but no big context clues .  too much , right ?  right !  the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels .  however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one .  he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that s it .  maybe some stunts .  for all this , i can t even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy !  and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say .  i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode .  george is in between them .  he s not quintessential , he s not horrible , he s good .  but i m sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they ll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we ll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) .  the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher .  last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey .  this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze .  we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ?  arnold isn t very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points .  when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber .  wow .  but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness .  it s like she s almost parodying herself in " pulp fiction " at points .  she s incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better .  as for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in " batman forever , " although i think his work in these is too hokey when he s best at quieter parts in " scent of a woman " or just plain cool parts in " fried green tomotoes . "  alicia - i love the girl but she s not particularly good in this film .  she can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in " clueless , " but her lines kinda sound weird .  and it isn t the mushy-mouth this time .  but in all fairness , she has virtually no part .  joel gets around to her occasionally and when she s on , she does stupid stuff . . . although  i know i m not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . . .  and poor elle .  poor , poor elle .  i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw " sirens " ) .  but she has no part ! ! !  it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product .  there are no " couch " scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) .  now listen to me on this one - in every " batman " flick , there s a couch scene .  in the original , it was with vicki .  in " returns , " it was a good make-out scene with selena .  and in the last one , it was a chat with nicole .  this one , it s nothing .  and batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she s suddenly " part of the family . "  fortunately , we get a lot of alfred .  he s the always reliable butler , in case you didn t know , who has been with bruce all his life .  he s a god .  he s a father figure .  he s also dying .  this got to me .  i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me .  we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . . . but  this is never answered , as this film is too cluttered .  but in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma .  for one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do .  and there are some nice touches .  when they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient s belongings in a room and we see the riddler s costume .  i laughed .  and during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as " droogs " from " a clockwork orange . "  i laughed at all these .  the film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or  did it just feel like that ?  the film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays .  people are fed up with stupid films .  that s why the word of mouth killed " the lost world ! "  that s why last year , indy films grossed more than ever .  that s why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it .  that s why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo s " face/off " and barry sonnenfeld s " men in black , " both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on .  i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste .  i like some of his films ( " flatliners , " " a time to kill " ) but a lot of them suck .  he s a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that s what makes him great .  but his costuming for woody allen s " sleeper " was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) .  i love the " batman " series .  the first two rocked and i did like the last one .  but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three .  hopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time .  and maybe they ll get smart and bring back catwoman .  and michael keaton .  but we can only hope .

negativeC,' writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer )  starring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso  i suppose i m not extremely surprised that " virus " comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it s an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron s early works .  in fact , " virus " is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the " aliens " vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future .  no such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron s wing for years and years , i m beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him .  in fact , " virus " should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like " virus " is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget .  the film seems to not only borrow it s plot from last year s similarly-fated " deep rising , " but also from a clunkish b-movie from the  80s called " leviathan , " an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part " alien , " part john carpenter s twisted remake of " the thing . "   " virus , " again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water .  they get on .  they break up into pairs and investigate .  and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) .  not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters .  of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper .  and it s not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even " aliens " played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don t give a damn .  i almost don t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he s a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed .  like anthony hopkins for " legends of the fall " ( the line " scrooooooo  em " has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) .  or peter o toole in " caligula . "  great actor , horrific performance .  it happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland s career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film .  though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it s laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them .   " virus " mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , " if it s dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable .

"  are not only justifiable , but encouraged . '
negativeC,' deuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) cleans fish tanks .  yeah , i didn t know that was a real job either .  one of his customers is antoine leconte ( oded fehr ) , a successful gigolo .  when antoine has to go to sweden for three weeks , he lets deuce use his house to look after an ailing $800 fish .  fooling around , deuce sets fire to the kitchen and smashes a $6000 fish tank .  after taking a try at one of antoine s clients and earning $10 , deuce decides to prostitute himself to raise the money to replace the fish tank before the fiery-tempered antoine returns .  enter t . j . ( eddie griffin ) , a pimp for " man-whores , " who arranges for deuce to service an assortment of women whose imperfections keep them from dating .  there s an enormous woman ( played by transvestite porn star chi chi la rue ) who hides food in her clothes .  there s claire ( gail o grady ) whose narcolepsy causes her to fall asleep every few minutes .  tina ( torsten voges ) is so tall her face doesn t fit on the screen , and ruth ( amy poehler ) has tourette s syndrome and shouts obscenities without warning .  finally there s kate ( arija bareikis ) whose sorority sisters secretly paid her fare .  she seems perfect , and deuce quickly falls in love with her .   ( she does , we discover later , have an imperfection , but deuce decides it isn t important . )  deuce s life is complicated by a bothersome cop ( william forsythe ) looking for information on antoine and by kate s discovery of his man-whoring .  however , neither threat generates much suspense .  the formula is so familiar that we know how it will end from the start .   " deuce bigalow " is the first project from adam sandler s company happy madison , the formation of which assures that we ll be seeing the sandler style of comedy mass-produced at an increasing rate in years to come .  be afraid .  be very afraid .  the good news is that sandler doesn t actually appear in " deuce " and that rob schneider and eddie griffin are funnier than sandler .  schneider has a sweetness that makes the clueless but good-hearted deuce believable .  griffin s delivery is dead-on , especially in the coining of " technical terms " for t . j .  s profession , as in " don t make me he-bitch man-slap you ! "  there s the expected amount of toilet humor in " deuce . "   ( for one thing , deuce s dad is a men s room attendant ) .  does anyone over the age of eight actually find bowel movements that funny ?  for most of us , i think that childhood fascination with bodily functions disappears when we hit the far-side of puberty and discover how funny sex is .  i , for one , will be glad when the toilet trend is finally flushed .  bottom line : " deuce " doesn t offer anything new but it is intermittently funny .

negativeC,' this is your definitive " hollywood " movie , extremely predictable , following the basic formula ( a horrible ending ) , overzealous writing ( meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting , therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space ) and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise-ass character ( of which we ve seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly , wasn t used enough here ) , i m afraid the film would have been completely unbearable .  in this film , ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend .  while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her .  over money ( how original ) .  while in jail she works out , exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition .  now she has learned about a law titled " double jeopardy " stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her ( although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works ) .  now her po ( parole officer ) , and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims .  skipping over to the acting : the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress ( no offense , she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times , in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better . . .  but she s terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying ) doesn t really add to the movie at all ; just takes away .  as i d said , jones was fine , although he did not have much to work with .  he was much more of a supporting character .  which is fine , and he handled it well ; especially considering the material he had to work with .  i feel this film had alot going for it .  originality not being an issue .  the acting was the only thing ( as i said ) keeping it alive .  the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better .  the action scenes were well made ( however sometimes out of place ) .  i was just left unsatisfied in the long run .  so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over-thought , the plot has certainly been done before ( generally speaking ) , the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot , and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones , who if he had some more screentime , could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating ; in my book , anyway .  keep this in mind , if you re in the mood for a good action film -- rent the fugitive .  d+ '
negativeC,' dead-bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it .  although dead-bang is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one " dead bore . "  in the film , johnson plays . . .  you guessed it . . .  a cop .  the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on " miami vice . "  a la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life .  beck s wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children .  she will not even allow him to wish them " merry christmas " by telephone .  but beck s family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang .  beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop .  his investigation starts in l . a . and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp .  virtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective .  the plot is incoherent and full of holes .  the movie depicts beck s investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions .  the action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense .  i certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii .  in all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction .  dead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting .  according to the movie s production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck .  you would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable .  most of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above .  william forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who s offended by beck s foul language and unorthodox methods .  forsythe s lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable .  dead-bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( " wkrp in cincinnati " and " frank s place " ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains .  the sole function of penelope ann miller s character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less .  i guess the film s title refers to this love scene since it s definitely a dead bang .  the only real virtue of dead-bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie s pitiful script .  johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life .  and i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments .  the funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him .  but when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie s in trouble .  the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen .  but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make . '
negativeC,' it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels , you must suspend disbelief .   however , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies .  it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald s , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by .  even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just dont gel .  firstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement .  he _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman .  as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases .  i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started .  but nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van .  with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesnt take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road .  jim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars .  but of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town .  the local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars .  director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite goodies versus baddies ,  there are numerous twists in its plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience .  but by the time these interesting changes occur , its far too late in the film for them to have much affect .  hard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par .  not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected .  such titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations .  strangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta .  we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character .  if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no .  i now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you dont believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) .  although hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen .  the addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that cant handle anything else .  despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film .  no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesnt really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 . 50 is compare this to other films .

negativeC,'  " some houses are born bad , " goes the haunting s tag line , to which i must add , " some movies , too . "  nothing short of hiring a new cast , a more literate screenwriter , and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson s meritorious novel .  the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy , and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don t frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout " boo . "  fragile nell ( taylor ) , bisexual theo ( zeta-jones ) , and smiley luke ( wilson ) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders , hosted by professor marrow ( neeson ) .  marrow s secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house s bleak history .  he s not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew , nell especially , who has some ancestral connection to the manor s previous inhabitants .  taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead .  for starters , her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes , when we re introduced to the mansion and all its fun-house trappings .  her character is supposed to be depressed , having tended to an unloving mother for too many years , but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame , alternately grouchy , mopey , wiggy and pathetic , and i kept wondering why the other characters didn t just ditch this bitch .  as for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones , she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her .  unfortunately , she s saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer .  theo s assessment of the house ?   " i love it !  sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters . "  who on earth would say that in place of " citizen kane meets the munsters " ?   ( furthermore , would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? )  both actresses fare better than neeson , who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason ) , and his character is the most bland .  as luke puts it , dr . marrow pulls the old " academic bait and switch " on his subjects , but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he s accused .  later , he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it s amusing to hear neeson shout " nell " repeatedly , given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name ) .  why was this nice , helpful , and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ?  the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti .  his sets are obsessively detailed , and even before the cgi kicks in , they seem alive , never quite still .  i do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots , nottinghamshire s harlaxton manor , is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house .  eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically .  thank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke , in that it was actually enjoyable , de bont has served up another ride , sans thrill .  his images , well-lit though they are , have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact , whole sequences , not to mention the cloaked , airy ghoul who owns the climax , feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back , peter jackson s the frighteners .  i don t mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist , i mean to suggest that he s a hack , having found no new ways to give us chills .

negativeC,' play it to the bone is a punch-drunk mess of a movie .  containing a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men can t jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two .  rocky no . 1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word . . .  something that he has not yet successfully achieved .  rocky no . 2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince s ex-girlfriend , grace .  both men are nearing the end of their " almost " careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity .  when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement .  our boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is " promised " a shot at a future title fight .  the film is divided into two sections .  at first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace s " sassy grassy " green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day .  along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by .  once in vegas , the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar .  both mr . harrelson and mr . banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past , not that we d know it from their work here .  mr . harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince .  the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable .  mr . banderas is uncharacteristically non-charismatic as caesar .  weak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance .  the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another .  tom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy liu ( payback ) is a sex-starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who can t make her mind up which boxer she prefers .  because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins .  but even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other .  writer/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well-choreographed , well-edited , and well-performed .  if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film .  as it is , the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable .  the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film .  the phrase , " play it to the bone  is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you ve achieved your desired goal .  that is a biblical principle .   " know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ?  so run , that ye may obtain . "  1 corinthians 9 : 24 [kjv]  achieving anything worthy in life requires " playing it to the bone " .  we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives .  this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives .  as a movie , play it to the bone is hardly worth our time .  but as a principle of life , the phrase " play it to the bone " are words to live by . '
negativeC,' i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie .  using their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget .  this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) .  now , before i continue to ferociously attack what s wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller .  catherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) .  if you ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don t have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes .  the problem we come to is that we ve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn t break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre .  the result is that the entire production feels contrived .  i m going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones .  now while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn t for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are .  just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between " entrapment " and " blackmail " .  with an eighty million dollar budget , you d think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x .  well , you d be wrong .  the action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular .  unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years .  the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what s going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists .  many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing .  one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask .  nothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn t she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ?  i ll tell you why : because it s a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones  posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) .  ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) .  one last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he ll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion .  i can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself " it ll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? "  we know jon , it s called editing . '
negativeC,' when i originally saw the trailer for " analyze this " a few months ago , i must admit , i thought it looked kind of lame .  and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago , i thought it looked outright bad .  but then when " analyze this " finally opened a few days ago , an odd thing happened .  it got great reviews .  critics were proclaiming it " hilarious " and a " dead-on parody of mob movies " .  well , with praise like that , i figured , it must be good and so i headed off to the theater .  you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts ?  well , turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for .   " analyze this " is slow , unfunny , and badly acted .  don t get me wrong , i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century , but he is just out of his league here .  i think the problem is he didn t quite know how to approach this material .  he plays his character , mob boss paull vitti , somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama .  if he had played the character straight , along the lines of leslie nielson in the " naked gun " series , he probably would have been a lot more successful .  as it is , though , he plays the character completely serious at some moments , and for laughs at others .  this doesn t work .  it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold ; you always know it s him .  and the movie is badly paced , too .  it never takes off .  it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum .  i think the blame for this should be placed on the script .  it s obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie , mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist , but once this is established , the movie doesn t really go anywhere .  the formula of the film seems to be this : billy crystal says no to deniro , deniro forces him , and much wackiness ensues .  this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie .  i ve said it before and i ll say it again : the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it s funny .  if " analyze this " had been funny , the pacing and bad acting wouldn t have bothered me .  i would have been too busy laughing to notice .  but as it is , i only chuckled a few times .  the only really funny scene is a dead-on parody of " the godfather " .  sadly , though , i don t think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody , because i was the only one laughing .  but my sense of humour , i have come to realize , is vastly different from the general population .  i loathed " there s something about mary " , yet loved " baseketball " .  now , if you want a movie that * i * think is funny , go out and see " office space " .  it s full of genuine laughs and won t leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes , as " analyze this " did .

negativeC,' jean-claude van damme movies tend to be , if nothing else , a lot of mindless fun .  his latest film , " knock off , " skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is , well , simply mindless .  you can t really blame van damme .  no one , i suspect , has ever expected " the muscles from brussels " to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray .  and even his sidekick co-star , " saturday night live " alumnus rob " makin  copies " schneider , does what s expected of him , although neither appear to want the role of straight man .  no , the problem with the film is its direction .  the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible . . .  and it goes downhill from there !  five hundred characters , it seems , are introduced within the first fifteen minutes .  van damme doesn t land his first kick until after thirty--too late for most action fans--and by the time the hour mark has rolled around , your jaw will be on your cup holder and you ll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess .  director hark tsui , whose previous film was the van damme/dennis rodman teamed " double team , " films at such a frenetic pace that it s hard to know what s going on , who s on whose side , and what the point of all this is .  faster than you can yell " fruit stand ! "  we re watching a crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme .  when schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with a four-foot eel while enthusing " move your beautiful big ass , " the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bizarre .  every now and again " knock off " will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishes--inventive camera shots and angles , wild rides down gun silencers and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below , revealing cut-ins within the frame--but they all happen too quickly , and within such a furious frame of reference , that they re wasted .  if only hark could have slowed things down just for a minute .  if you re interested in the plot , you re better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the on-screen shenanigans : " jean-claude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with " nanobombs " hidden in cabbage patch knock-offs .  maybe .  with paul sorvino . "  a more accurate summary would be " jean-claude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large , blatant coca-cola product placements . "  the fact that the film is staged during hong kong s last days under british rule gets some lip service but doesn t figure in at all .  perhaps " knock off "  s most intriguing credit is that ron and russell mael composed the frenzied music score .  some of you might remember the mael brothers as the  80s synth pop duo sparks ; their contributions here are as confused as the accompanying action-- " kimono my house " indeed !  like the cheap jeans and " pumma " sneakers manufactured in hong kong , van damme s latest is a real phony .

" twilight " wants very much to be a 1940 s film noir with alan ladd or dick powell .  all of the standard tropes are here : a hard-boiled p . i .  among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets , a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero , shadowy figures shooting from doorways , dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn , cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation .  the script offers little originality , and co-authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich ? in 1998 .  elmer bernstein s score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn note-for-note from a vintage noir .  the lead actors try hard-none of the three has every made less than a full effort , even when burdened with a bad script .  they try to invest every line and gesture with meaning , and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters .  harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine .  jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harry s love for catherine .  catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention , but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefully-maintained veneer .   " twilight " wants to be character-driven like " nobody s fool " ( also directed by benton , also starring newman , based on a novel by russo ) was , but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with .   " twilight " also squanders a fine supporting cast : stockard channing ( harry s friend on the police force ) , reese witherspoon ( jack & catherine s bratty kid ) , giancarlo esposito ( the humorous sidekick ) , john spencer ( harry s nemesis on the force ) , liev schreiber and margo martindale ( the blackmailers ) , and james garner ( a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble ) .

negativeC,' there was probably a good reason that the warner bros . studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened .  and , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why .  this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago .  fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god s country , somewhere in eastern kentucky .  it s beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role ) .  it turns out that he s filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit .  seagal plays jack taggert , an aikido-versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa .  no . . . not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa .  it s the environmental protection agency .  i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers !  taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice .  written by someone named jeb , i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships , banjo-picking preachers , and dumb-as-nails rednecks .  but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in .  seagal s idea of a disguise is a long-length $1000 leather jacket .  but to get closer to the kinfolk , he will fix people s porches for free .  that s another great epa asset - teaching agents how to fix porches .  slow and plodding , this project is a total mess .  the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige .  here , his bravado basically turns into bullyness .  townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued .  fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever .  and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes .  the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony , gets behind the pulpit , and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment .  but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping , kristopherson , meets up with seagal .  kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away .  seagal gallantly replies : " i ll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth . "  i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background .  this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal s righteousness and narcissistic arrogance .  seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace , that of the enviro-thriller ( on deadly ground ) .  however , the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this .  still , i believe in preserving mother earth , so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity .

negativeC,' tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers , all searching for deeper meaning .  however , they won t find much meaning in the real blonde , and not enough real humor , either .  joe ( matthew modine ) is a struggling actor , or he claims to be one , even though he has no credits under his belt .  his girlfriend , mary ( catherine keener ) has no pretensions about her career : she s a makeup artist , working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) and supermodel of the month , sahara ( bridgette wilson ) .  sahara , who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid , has an on-again , off-again relationship with joe s best friend , bob ( maxwell caulfield ) .  however , bob has gotten his biggest break yet : a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly ( daryl hannah ) , who may be that illusive woman he s always pursued : a real blonde .  there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde , but not enough .  the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background , such as sahara s perfume ads : " depression - it s not just a state of mind " .  but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel .  and , unfortunately , the film s forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic .  take for example the film s framing device of an old lady and her dog .  the story serves absolutely no purpose , makes little sense , and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie .  matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film , but they re stuck in the most boring plotlines .  modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley , who appears as another struggling actor .  keener s character has a stronger edge , but the insult self-defense class ( taught by denis leary , no less ) she is stuck in makes little sense .  the movie s running time is under two hours , but it seems like it is well over it .  there s just not enough humor to speed things along , and not enough meaning to propel any drama .

negativeC,' the ads for " batman and robin " scream " the event of the summer is here " and that s the problem .  the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it .   " batman and robin " is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance .  it s like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun .  it wasn t always this way .  tim burton s " batman " was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge .  the film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel .  batman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night .  the joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent .  batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city s breathtaking gothic skyline .  those days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck .   " batman and robin " has far more in common with the campy 60 s batman tv show than with tim burton s tale of darkness .  the blame lies with director joel schumacher .  a former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes .  unfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn t the faintest notion of what to do .   " batman and robin " is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it s often difficult to tell who s whacking who .  while the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti .  a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film .   " batman and robin " doesn t merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions .  it s rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one .  ironically , the parts of " batman and robin " that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne .  easily the best batman yet , clooney s expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn t even hint at .  the film s most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne s butler and surrogate father .  as for the other heroes , chris o donnell s robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl .  in a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne s girlfriend is puzzling .  i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight .  of course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that s where " batman and robin " really suffers .  as mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion .  laboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he s having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act .  uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy .  she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it s apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) .  once thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss .  thurman fails to maintain the character s maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film .  the biggest lesson to be learned from " batman and robin " is that more is not better .  joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is .  some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam .  i don t think so .  my prescription ?  fire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist s convention so he ll understand that there s no hard feelings ) .  give alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o donnell and michael gough .  call jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman .  then , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the " event " mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time .

negativeC,'  " gordy " is not a movie , it is a 90-minute-long " sesame street " skit , and a very bad one at that .  this movie is so stupid and dumb that it s depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light , and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie .  i m sure children are the target audience of this movie , but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it .  it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms ) , whose family has been taken away to " up north , " which we know means death .  of course we can hear the animals talk to each other , and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible .  actually , it s almost funny in a way .  the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears , a little girl named jinnie sue macallister ( young ) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him .  jinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it .  what is the point of this ?  maybe she is one of the producer s relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something .  we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce ( roescher ) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating .  he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue , but he accidentally falls in a pool ( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a $200 suit on - nah , didn t see that one coming ! ) ,  starts to drown , and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him .  if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank s grandfather , the original ceo , dies and leaves his fortune to hank . . .  and gordy !  of course there must be a villain , but even this villain ( donadio as sipes ) isn t that evil .  he never raises his voice or becomes angry , and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story .  it s hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film , or if the filmmaker s are just this untalented and stupid .  at times " gordy " is tolerable to watch , thus earning it one star and not the dreaded " z- . "  but it s just so unbelievably boring , cliche , dumb , unfunny , corny , and just plain bad it may scare children , it certainly disturbed me .

negativeC,' senseless ( r ) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian , and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life .  alas , moments are simply that , moments , which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its one-joke premise .  granted , that one joke is initially amusing .  when wayans s darryl witherspoon , an economics major at stratford university , hits some dire financial straits , he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses .  after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses , darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm .  at this point , the film sounds more like senseful than senseless , but through some turns of the plot , darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once , essentially leaving him--yes--senseless .  this sets up some showcase moments for wayans s gift for physical comedy , especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely , hilariously limp .  but these gags , and the gag behind the entire movie , quickly grows stale .  once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses , instead of exploring any new comic territory , director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness .  wayans approaches each go-round with gusto , but by this point he s simply treading water for the rest of the film s unfunny duration .  senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn t strive to be anything more than a comic trifle .  however , the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity .  darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family , and this " serious " angle seems to come from an entirely different movie .  unlike wayans s last starring vehicle , the surprisingly effective ( and serious ) the 6th man , the " emotional " content of senseless is forced and unconvincing .  any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles--darryl s romance with janice ( tamara taylor ) , a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself , does not generate sparks of any kind .  once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros . comes to an end , the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big-screen future ahead of him .  but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless , his film career could go the way of his once-promising older brother , damon , who is now set to make his comeback--on television .

negativeC,' a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent , but one with no edge to it .  it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ? s and stock characters of this genre .  though it s a well-written and well-acted fluff piece , it still does not have too much to say that is surprising .  it s made for the gentle art-house set , those who don t want something too disturbing to think about .  it s about a critically successful writer husband , alec ( pryce ) , who is so self-absorbed that he s threatened by his department store floor-walking model wife , kate ( bouquet ) , who wants to be a writer .  she meets his crass publisher , vanni corso ( walken ) , another self-absorbed man , and a predictable relationship occurs .  the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband s first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet .  she now wants her own identity and her independence .  the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie .  the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax .  it s set in london , and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper , vanni .  she later meets him as her hubby s new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality , and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel .  alec who is an obnoxious grouse , someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with , tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published--which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni .  the publisher is proud that he s a mamma s boy who never married and is a self-made man who has earned millions .  he has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it , as he proudly tells kate : " if my father could sell pizzas in harlem , i could sell culture in europe . "  the only thing that couldn t be sold , is this stiff story and tired plot line .  the mystery to me , is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy .  she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon-to-become-beleaguered vanni .  when she writes a second novel , he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did .  it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one , as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper .  a business affair was loosely based on the real-life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly , in their celebrated 1950s love triangle .

negativeC,' if you re the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn ( butter optional ) , then this is the movie for you !  indeed , this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies , or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them .  it s difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film .  but at least we re warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase , giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show .  what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie ?  first , the movie gives us an introductory premise .  huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor , and in this area , many ships have disappeared .  oooh . . . scary !  secondly , a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery , but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score .  third , the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo ( treat williams ) .  he operates a sophisticated military-style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy .  finally , in the cargo hold , we see those that hired him .  they are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts , talk with accents , and try to show how macho they are .  during their trip across the stormy sea , their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs .  spotting a cruise ship in the distance , they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop , take the parts that they need , and then continue on their merry way .  little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster .  yet , they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds .  this is nothing more than a by-the-book action film .  their realization of the situation that they re in doesn t happen until they are in the bowels of the boat .  those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed .  the corridors on the ship are narrow , misty , and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare-fests must have .  yet , despite the predictable nature of this film , there are some scary " boo " moments .  but most of it is just outright silly .  and this film is unusually gory too .  monsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains .  there is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive .  he screams horribly as the monster s digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away .  additionally , it borrows heavily from speed2 , alien and a bunch of other recent films .  the mercenaries even run into a lone , surviving passenger ( femke jannsen ) who looks amazingly like sandra bullock .  to be honest , when i left the theatre , i just had to laugh at how witless the film was .  it s moronic fun at best .  so , if you re hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness , then this might just hit the spot .

negativeC,' synopsis : when a meteorite crashlands in the arizona desert , community college professors ira kane ( duchovny ) and harry block ( jones ) are first on the scene .  they discover that an alien lifeform has arisen from the rock and is evolving at an amazing rate .  soon the army , advised by dr allison reed ( moore ) , moves in and forces kane and block out .  but when the aliens begin to menace society , it may take the scientists  combined efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another lifeform : humanity .  review : " evolution " certainly has the ingredients for a decent comedy .  it s directed by reitman , clearly trying to parlay his " ghostbusters " success into a twenty-first-century counterpart .  it stars duchovny , and although one might question his judgment in lampooning his " x-files " character so soon after leaving the tv series , it should certainly provide him with plenty of ammunition .  and then there s moore , who may not have much prior experience in comedy , but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress .  a shame , then , that it all deteriorates into such a hopelessly unfunny morass .   " evolution " is a movie more concerned with its special effects ( which are quite good ) than anything resembling a consistently funny script .  it has its moments ( a scene in which jones  body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining ) , but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour .  moore is totally wasted , her clumsy shtick getting very old , very fast .  duchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with .  and the story is so formulaic , it could have been written by monkeys .  part of what made " ghostbusters " so wonderful was a combination of a great script and characters the audience could root for .   " evolution " is so mind-numbingly tedious that it s difficult not to start cheering for the aliens . '
negativeC,' deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie .  this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises , and , being true to its title , being deceptive .  but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit .  braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute ( renee zellweger ) .  their lone suspect is wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker s pocket .  however , a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators , as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables .  braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives .  braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook ( ellen burstyn ) , a local bookie .  kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite ( rosanna arquette ) , believing his wife to be unfaithful .  the plot is twisty and complex , with lots of lengthy flashbacks , and plenty of surprises .  however , there are times when it is needlessly complex , and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost .  take a look at l . a . confidential , or the film s more likely inspiration , the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled .  the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot .  for example , the film tells a few substories ( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender , or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear ) , but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable .  there s never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation .  they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay .  the characters , themselves , are rather pathetic and despicable .  not one of them is an ounce sympathetic , and as a result , the labyrinthine plot is all for naught .  what does it matter who is guilty of what and why ?  writer-directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers  masterwork blood simple , or the wachowski brothers  less worthy bound .  but , while they have got the plot twists down cold , they need to work on characterization and dialogue .

negativeC,' this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney s live- action george of the jungle .  tarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough s legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far .  badly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves .  i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it s not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie .  furthermore , it s even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence .  and , while i m not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production .  of course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film s troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line .  imagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like .  with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse .  anyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect .  the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) .  the film doesn t attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough .  instead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) .  he is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble .  meanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization .  on the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals .  one shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help .  with lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born .  its patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability .  with his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal .  his pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off .  jane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her .  some six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud s steamy the lover .  since then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency .  tarzan continues this trend .  march may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can t act .  meanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy .  instead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance .  the story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies .  the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless .  the romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane s presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance .  the special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) .  and , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals .  over the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material .  the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) .  weismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number .  and , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 .

negativeC,'  " desperate measures " is a generic title for a film that s beyond generic .  it s also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more " before and after " than " reversal of fortune . "  the movie is a big disappointment , and yet it s somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing .  too bad the execution s all wrong , though , because the set-up of " desperate measures " boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use .  san francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission .  even worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society .  connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he s at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital .  when he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy .  one misstep " desperate measures " makes is in its underdevelopment of matt s illness .  what s needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow .  take , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital .  the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ?  he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight .  connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son .  whatever .  to be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie s problems .  first and foremost is how cheaply " desperate measures " trades the potential of it s opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour .  once mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills .  there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away .  also , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia s frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; " desperate measures " appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie s head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this .  there is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department .  cast against type , michael keaton s understated menace is highly effective .  although he s not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord .  joseph cross , as garicia s ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos .  this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost .  it goes without saying that " desperate measures " needs an operation of its very own .

negativeC,' robin williams is a comedic genus .  that is , he is one when he s in a film that allows him space to move .   " flubber " straps him in a straitjacket , covers him with duct tape , stuffs him in a coat closet and piles furniture against the door to make sure that he doesn t get out .  in a re-make of its own 1961 " absent minded professor " , disney offers us proof that more is definitely less .  recycling old films ( " that darned cat " , " 101 dalmatians " ) dressed up as new is the newest money machine from the home of the mouse that roared .  professor phillip brainard ( williams ) is a terminally forgetful scientist teaching at a small college .  his fiancee , sara jean reynolds ( marcia gay harden ) , president of the college is none too happy with him because he s left her waiting at the altar due to his lack of short-term -- and long-term -- memory .  she s giving him one more chance .  he blows that chance when he invents " flubber " ( flying rubber ) and is so excited by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress .  his tardiness is helped along by his jealous flying robotic assistant who wants him all to herself .  it s not all bad news .  flubber is a green jello that can magnify and reflect energy that is applied to it .  brainard realizes the commercial potential within the goo can save the school from bankruptcy and being taken over by the town s evil industrialist charles hoenicker ( raymond barry ) .  while he s busy with his new breakthrough , the slighted sweetheart is being wooed by his sleazy rival wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald ) .  there s a flying car , flubber-enhanced basketball game and an assortment of broken lab equipment : none of which are the least bit interesting or funny .  at one point , my son looked around the audience and asked " why are these people laughing ? "  although williams turns in one of his least inspired roles , he is easily the most lively of the actors .  everyone else comes across as half-asleep .  the re-make is successful in that respect .  it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties .  i remember the original as being charming , but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years .  there have been some updates .  fred macmurray s flying model t has been replaced by a t-bird .  his faithful dog charlie is now " weebo " , the hovering robot .  the biggest change is that , with sophisticated computer animation , we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining .  flubber is anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality .  the gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number .  this has nothing to do with the story .  the only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys .  not that contributing little to the plot is a big problem .  there are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do don t make sense .  the discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford .  anyone with half a brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions .  it s unbelievable that his lover ( well , probably not a lover -- after all this is disney ) starts dating croft after the aborted wedding .  there s not one appealing component of this man .  after the professor discovers that smearing a golf ball with the gunk causes it to bounce uncontrollably around his lab wreaking havoc , i cringed as he picked up a bowling ball .  this guy is beyond forgetful , venturing into the certifiable .  co-writer john hughes used to direct light-weight but thoughtful teen films .  the care behind " pretty in pink " and " the breakfast club " all went out the window after his " home alone " franchise heated up the box offices .  looking much like " home alone 3 1/2 " , " flubber " even features a couple of vapid goons who get banged around and a cute little boy who screams a lot .  in some ways , it s difficult to judge this film .  i have a suspicion that i m not it s target audience .  after all , i measure my age in two digits .

negativeC,' ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his , or her , sophistication ?  it s full of stops and starts and usually , the punch line is ruined .  i felt the same way watching drowning mona .  skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy .  there are some slightly successful attempts at humor , but they only serve as window dressing .  there is a running gag about the town , verplanck , n . y . , being a test town for the then new yugo .  everyone drives a yugo , differentiating their cars with personalized license plates .  even the police chief drives one .  there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets .  there also is a running gag about one of the characters , jeff , missing a hand and how it occurred .  it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends .  it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend .  there are some sight gags that pop up as well , such as mona s tombstone , which reads " demoted " , instead of devoted .  still , the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond .  the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona ( midler ) .  each scene with her is the same : scream at someone , hit someone , then scream some more .  there s no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness .  anyone off the street could have played the role , such as it is .  the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts .  each one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization .  there is a burly , female car mechanic , so of course , there is a forced lesbianism gag .  mona s son , jeff ( marcus thomas ) is a simpleton , hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth .  chief of police rash ( devito ) likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter .  there s nothing more to him .  elle , the chief s daughter ( campbell ) , is bland personified , a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married .  mona s husband phil ( fichtner ) jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch .  bob ( affleck ) , elle s betrothed , and business partner to jeff , is a mumbling , obvious dullard .  there is no contrast to any of the characters .  by having at least one character with some wit , or wits , to serve as counterpoint to the others , perhaps steinfeld s attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better .  ostensibly a murder mystery , drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately , then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer , who could be anyone due to mona s loving manner with everyone on town .  even that aspect of the film fails , throwing in a convenient , ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things .  it s been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood .  what makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it s ineptitude .

negativeC,' what are we going to do with jim carrey ?  viewers of television s " in living color " know this one-man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill .  viewers also know that " in living color " is a skit-show and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way .  unfortunately , this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura : pet detective .  three writers , including carrey , worked on the slapstick story , which sends a self-styled " pet detective " on the trail of a stolen dolphin .  the missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins , who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl .  for plot porpoises , this story works as well as any three stooges short .  carrey gets to do his " official " schtick as he snoops around greater miami .  he leers and sneers , craning his neck to funny effect .  he even does his captain kirk impersonation .  again .  all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers have absolutely no intention of focusing on anyone * other * than carrey .   ( suggested alternate title--jim carrey : will do anything for a laugh . )  export it to france and you may have a hit .  as it stands , ace ventura isn t even good kid s stuff .  the profanity count , alone , is too high .  which is ironic , since children are , probably , carrey s best audience .  the film doesn t even have the goofball charm of chris elliott s recent no-brainer cabin boy .  sure , carrey has his moments .  but what can you say about a film whose high-points include watching carrey slink around to the theme from " mission impossible ? "  ace ventura has one glaring incongruity .  amid the butt-jokes and double-takes , the script takes great pains to set-up an elaborate and rather funny " crying game " gag .  and , for * this * intended audience , that takes ( ahem ) cojones . '
negativeC,' there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space - it s just that none of them happen to be actors .  the stars i m referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie s " outer space " ; the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home .  yes , in terms of acting , the star power is .   .   .  well , more like a falling star .  kinda pretty , short-lived , and pretty much dead .  lost in space , as if you really didn t know , is based on the 60 s sci-fi television series of the same name .  it s the year 2058 , and earth s precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population .  john robinson ( william hurt ) is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet .  earth s entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission , but nobody , whether it be john s family or hired battle pilot don west ( matt leblanc ) , seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years .  john s family consists of his wife maureen ( mimi rogers ) , his atypical teenage daughter penny ( lacey chabert ) , his ingenious son will ( jack johnson ) , and his beautiful scientist daughter judy ( heather graham ) .  despite everyone s reluctance , the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space .  unknown to anyone but the audience , there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission .  dr . smith ( gary oldman ) has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour , and dr . smith has re-programmed a talking robot to " destroy robinson family " !  when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides , the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination , and now the premise of being lost in space is complete .  as for the audience , you will likely be lost in boredom by this point , wondering if the plot , like the jupiter 2 , will ever get off the ground .  it s hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script ?  chabert is basically the only one to overdo it , sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium .  if you , like me , were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens , you re wrong !  that s just her normal voice !  in yet another example of a " friend " faltering on the big screen , leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming ( make sense ? ) , it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod .  graham is a babe - thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film .  hurt , the black hole of excitement , sucks up any energy that might have been left .  if hurt were available in tablet form , he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill .  johnson isn t dull , he s just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody s ass all the time .  want an example of how cool this kid can be ?  how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family ?  hey , don t laugh - the thing actually listened to the mr . rogers-would-be-proud sentiment .  but alas , if you thought a character couldn t be much worse , there was rogers as the epitome of generic ( or , mother as she was known ) .  why hire an actress ?  they could ve had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it .  now that would ve had some pizzazz !  lost in space luckily doesn t suffer in every single category that it could have .  the special effects are crisp , clear , and at least mildly captivating , unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman , who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse .  unfortunately , oldman is locked away for most of the film , giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy .  while the special effects are pleasing to the eye , they are nothing you couldn t find in most modern sci-fi films .  contact , for example , far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination .  lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art , with numerous contradictions ( the time travel aspect was horribly flawed ! ) , wooden and corny acting , worse dialogue , and an ending so disappointing , you d be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens .  then again , with an ending like this film has , it s obvious a sequel is already being considered .  what an awful note to end on , knowing there could be more of this in a year or two .  the attempt to be family oriented is commendable , but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups .  well , danger potential movie goers !  danger !  this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity .

negativeC,' so , it s thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again .  that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn t for the fact that the " odd couple " of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993 s " grumpy old men , " 1995 s " grumpier old men , " and 1997 s " out to sea " ( i . e .   " grumpiest old men " ) .  so , " the odd couple ii " ( i . e .   " the grumpiest old men of all , really " ) seems just another entry in a tired series .  the plot is even similar to that of " grumpy old men " in that lemmon and matthau s mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children .  oscar s son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix s daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car .   .   .  then hilarity ensues .  well , a few chuckles ensue anyway .  neil simon , the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end .  unlike the original play/movie , " odd couple ii " doesn t find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters .  instead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of " cybill " and jean smart of " designing women " ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert .  the original 1968 movie " the odd couple " remains a classic comedy .  it introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since .  it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966 s " the fortune cookie " ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , " the front page " ( 1974 ) and " buddy buddy " ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways .  the reunion of lemmon and matthau in " grumpy old men " six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie .  but " out to sea " and " the odd couple ii " are just beating a grumpy old horse .   ( you can add lemmon s " my fellow americans , " i . e .   " grumpy old presidents , " to that list , too . )  let s hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do .  let s hope also that we see neil simon s name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993 s " lost in yonkers " ) .

negativeC,' except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy , that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through .  bette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan , actress and author , once married , now violently divorced , and back together one last time for their daughter molly s ( paula marshall ) wedding .  lilly and dan hate each other passionately -- so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again .  each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the other .  molly , married now only 24 hours , runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith ( jamie denton ) tries to console the abandoned spouses .  in molly s search for her parents , she somehow falls in love with lilly s paparazzo joey ( danny nucci ) .  meanwhile , the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan s wife rowena ( gail o grady ) in bed .  the audience i saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious .  i m no dan quayle , but i thought it was a bit creepy .  the message seemed to be " ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish . "   " family values " aside , there s something cruel about all this .  perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy , but the movie is a romantic comedy .  we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps .  reiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable .  lilly s husband is a new-age flake who rambles about " emotional valet parking , " so we can write him off as irrelevant .  dan s wife is vain , manipulative , and jealous so we can write her off as a bitch .  molly s husband is a career-conscious , self-centered republican politician who thinks she s too fat ( and just for good measure , he also fucked dan s wife ) , so we can write him off as a prick .  everyone else falls in love .  but still , that somehow doesn t justify the actions of the movie s main characters .   " he s a prick " or " she s a bitch " is no defense .  the movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog -- often during heated arguments -- and by above-average performances by midler and farina ( breaking out of his character-actor mold ) .  other than that , it s a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick .

negativeC,' maybe this mission should have been scrubbed  mission to mars  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  there s a world of difference between artists and technicians .  the artist has a vision to create something new .  he may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it s something you ve never seen before .  a good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it s going to be just a xerox .  obviously successful films need both skills .  brian de palma is a masterful technician .  he s spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock .  he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote .  aside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead .  in de palma s latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick .  to tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called " 2001 " .  i enjoyed it even more when it was titled " close encounters " .  nasa has set its sights for mars .  when the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet .  they don t do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe .  and it s all so boring .  there are so many scenes that just don t work , it s difficult to begin .  when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from " dune " ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching .  error .  the most interesting character ( and that s not saying much ) is killed off .  error .  the alien is laughable .  error .  the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable .  error .  there s some nice eyecandy .  the face on mars , which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head , looks cool .  a three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world .  maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic .  but there s so much more that feels as if we ve been there before .  from " 2001 " , there s the rotating space station , the blinding white room .  >from " close encounters " , they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens .  the list goes on .  the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues .  even gary sinise and tim robbins can t muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing .  no one seems to care about anything that happens .  you won t either .  the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr . pepper , with a 20 foot tall logo , saves the day .  they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film .

negativeC,' mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival .  as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival .  it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time .  in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry .  toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart .  the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it .  something else is what he did .  the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life .  she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep .  meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada .  she wants to build a career as an actress .  betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow .  she does not know who the woman is .  she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is .  they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not .  meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own .  he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) .  these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong .  there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion .  in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits .  a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun .  lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film .  he just chooses not to .  as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason .  there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches .  the film is a little long for the subject matter .  toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot .  unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers .  i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  mulholland drive spoiler warning .  i have rated this film fairly low .  you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film .  david lynch is in large part a dark satirist .  most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside .  in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre .  what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? )  playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on .  the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout .  then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something .  the audience expectation is that they will add up .  but he has given clues that are self-contradictory .  lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories .  in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke .  there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties .  mad magazine called it a poiuyt .  other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar .  look at small portions of it and makes sense .  look at the whole figure and it does not .  this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar .

negativeC,' ingredients : possessed plastic dolls in love , plastic dolls having sex  starring : jennifer tilly , voice of brad dourif , katherine heigl , nick stabile , john ritter  synopsis : this is the fourth film in the chucky series , which debuted in the late 1980s .  basically , chucky is a plastic doll that can walk and talk because it is possessed by the spirit of a slain murderer .  in bride of chucky , chucky s longtime girlfriend tiffany ( jennifer tilly ) dies and her spirit inhabits a female plastic doll through voodoo .  dolls tiffany and chucky get married and embark on a quest to reach a cemetery in new jersey , where a mystical gem might enable them to be humans .  the dolls stow away in the back of a vehicle driven by a newly eloped couple , so in the side plot , the couple suspects each other of being a murderer .  opinion : bride of chucky is an attempt at horror with humor , but doesn t succeed .  somehow , chucky moaning about mid life crisis , and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky .  and tiffany harping about mid life crisis , and how she should have gotten married does not make for a very scary tiffany .  the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tilly s cleavage to keep attention during the first half , and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half .  the best that can be said about bride of chucky is that it is sarcastic .

negativeC,' watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute  n cuddly , computer-generated monkey .  if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star .  alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs .  what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars .  that s pretty generous , considering the movie s camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek .  when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it .  so why such a seemingly high rating ?  there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage .  first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater .  the sound and screen kicked ass .  nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don t necessarily mean that in a good way ) .  also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie s tension .  i even liked the computer-generated settings .  i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i ve seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities .  also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain .  william hurt isn t too bad either .  neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable .  and perhaps i shouldn t admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood .  there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a " real " kiss -- no sex ) .  it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six .  those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven .  that type of moviemaking is a lost art .  now for the bad news .  worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue .  it s squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction .   " you better hold on to your joystick , " is one such line .  and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign .  second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay .  the story s exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what s happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest .  once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived .  when gary oldman easily reprograms will s pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : " he flipped the switch to  evil .   "  then there s the tone of the movie .  the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson .  then it could be an adventure movie .  they re mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn t a good enough actor to carry it off .  still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination .  just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn t mean that we have to bow to a " promise keepers " notion of who s the center of a family .  many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect .  and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie .  in star wars , the rebels were the good guys .  we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system .  in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free .  that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists .  finally , a few specific details deserve criticism .  the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 .  why ?  why bother saying what year this is .  just tell us it s the future .  i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 .  setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won t be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) .  then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole .  this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny s barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven t learned a thing about ergonomics .  one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool .  the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip .  this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie .  but if that s the best part of the movie , i can t in good conscience recommend it .  still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your " bad movie bingo " cards .

negativeC,' i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies .  luckily , my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta !  i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality , but i couldn t help myself . . .  i got it .  well , after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn t dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie .  this movie really sucks .  it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy ! !  for example , how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days ?  jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail .  the songs are bad , the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar s ) , and the direction is the worst of all .  the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up .  i didn t even finish the movie . . .  i couldn t take it anymore .  note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ) , i guess you d like this movie .  it s practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff .  aditya panscholi is the sidekick again .   ( i was going to give it a zero , but i personally like jackie shroff , so i loosened up a little .  he looked fresh , wore good clothes ( as always ) , and his performance , even though it wasn t his best , was the only saving grace of the movie ) '
negativeC,' starship troopers is a bad movie .  i mean , a really , really , bad movie .  not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) .  looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme .  that being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who s logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth .  the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) .  as the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another s hand .  eventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet .  as our faster than light travelling " heroes " arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . .   " what ? "  you say , " laser beam weapons ?  sonic weapons ?  phasers ?  photon cannons ? " .  nope , they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns , pump action rifles , and tactical nuclear weapons !  i guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry .  as the assault begins , our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon .  two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them , and one even sees a streak fly by , but disregards it as nothing .  this of course , leads to more massive carnage , blood shed , and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies .  again , i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons !  in the end , we see neil patrick " doogie howser " harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat , hat , and gloves .  he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug , and then proclaims that the bugs are scared !  this sets the troopers into a frenzy , as they are now one step closer to completing their goal , total genocide of a species ( again , sound familiar ? ? ) .  i have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review , but given it s non-existence , i may have anyway .  i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart , but don t want to bore you too badly .  in short , i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro-nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies , a drivers education accident scene film , and a complete blank screen ( the plot , of course ) .  i wouldn t recommend this movie to anyone , anywhere , under any circumstance .  copyright ( c ) 1997 tim jandt " > '
negativeC,' capsule : one of the ten worst movies ever made .  christopher lambert vs . evil ninjas in modern-day japan . . .  and nobody wins .  the hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain-damaged that i could almost feel affection for it .  i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren t also insanely xenophobic and insulting .  christopher lambert plays a computer-parts salesman who s on business in japan .  he meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) .  apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered .  since lambert is a witness , he s of course the next one to die .  let s stop and think about this for a second .  if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he d have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock .  in this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him .  i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body .  you know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is .  this is , of course , only the beginning of the movie s problems .  lambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun .  they are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows .  the script doesn t know what the hell to do with them .  lone , as the bad guy , is zero-dimensional .  the only bad-guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him .  in the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype .  what s funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there s a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful .  also , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it s been designed to accompany .  there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re-couple the whole thing with the movie s relentlessly stupid plot .  by the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham-handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care .  we re not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies !  someone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way .  this movie bungles two out of three , badly .

( judging by the costuming at the end of the movie , the main accomplishment of this brave new world is in re-inventing polyester . )  when he s not pointing the camera directly at himself , director costner does have a nice visual sense , and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly jingoistic film in the trust-no-one 90 s ; but by the time the second hour rolled around , i was reduced to sitting on my hands to keep from clawing out my own eyes .  mark this one " return to sender " .

negativeC,' starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz  permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this .  the film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity .   ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . )  ultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself .  ben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit .  he eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for " alf " : chompers looks just like alf except he s blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons .  insert proverbial downward spiral here .  permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story .  i ve spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i ve been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive .  as stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there s something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer .  what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy .  watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby !  watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble !  stiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie .  but permanent midnight is mostly soulless .  when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ?  and then answers it in the form of bello s character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ?  in the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn t need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself .  if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it s that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man .   ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs .  is this hollywood . . . california ? )  i learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead .  of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems .  so , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he s apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects .  so much for the moral of that story .  temporary midnight is more like it .  -bill chambers ; september , 1998 '

"  the letter-writer ( a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook ) soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens .  it s now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before it s too late .  while this movie has some nice visually eerie effects , too much of it s impact had to be generated with extreme close-ups , while the level of suspense was choppy at best .  there is so much more that this movie could have been , but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills .  it could have been a clever whodunit , but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders .  it could have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood , but seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film .  it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you re alone and you see shadowy figures moving about , you don t walk towards them yelling " hello " .  once you yell " hello " , you can expect an extreme close-up , a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse .  it s difficult to be in suspense when you know what s about to happen .  the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that i now have a neat idea for a halloween costume , but i m not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks .  the horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it .

negativeC,'  " goodbye , lover " sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may , and one look will tell you why .  it s a mess .  and that s * way * before ellen degeneres shows up .  the film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters .  i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller , one wrote a murder mystery , and one wrote a comedy , then director roland joff ? tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment .  i didn t laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to ) .  degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair .  either degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn t yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist .  every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid .  her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is " at least she died healthy . "  and that s one of her wittier asides .  degeneres  sgt .  rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of . . . wait .  to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple-crosses .  it s best described this way :  sultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake , a " creative yet unfocused " ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep , played by dermot mulroney .  sandra likes to act out her deep-seated sexual fantasies and jake s brother ben ( the suave-as-ever don johnson ) likes to help .  ben is also coming on to his petite , mousy co-worker peggy blaine ( mary-louise parker ) and someone , somewhere , is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his .  the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again .  although there are some genuine surprises , the plot twists get too contrived too quickly .  probably around the time degeneres  gumcracking gumshoe appears .  at least the former " ellen " star is going for something a little different .  arquette turns in yet another of her stiletto-heeled , platinum blonde bombshell roles ( see : " lost highway , " " true romance " ) while quoting embarrassing lines like " i m not wearing any underwear . "  i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this .  here s an example of some of the film s flat-out stupidity .  sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film s duplicitous lovers .  she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite " the sound of music " on her car stereo , intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims .  so what was the point of the wig and the car ?   " the sound of music " stuff might be a reference to " the wizard of oz " allusions in david lynch s " wild at heart , " but if so joff ? must have forgotten that " wild at heart " was a despicable movie .  it s hard to believe that " goodbye , lover " was directed by the same person who made " the killing fields " and " the mission . "  it s not , however , hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long .  it should have stayed there . '
negativeC,' as with any gen-x mtv movie ( like last year s dead man on campus ) , the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points : sex and football .  those two items , wrapped in a guilty-pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons .  first , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre isn t mainstream and it s been retread to death .  second , the sex is just bad .  despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all-night strip-club party , there s nothing even remotely tantalizing .  the acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic jon voight .  cultivating his usual sliminess , voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer .  kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes  twenty-two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans to make it twenty-three .  unfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he s got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) .  moxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football-crazy west canaan .  most regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most .  similarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer .  these elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv s core audience is the high school demographic .  this focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv s " dawson s creek , " is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role .  other stars are similarly young and unmemorable .  there s not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there s not much to like about it , either .  everything herein has already been done , and if it hasn t , the movie manages to botch it one way or another .  this is certainly missable .

negativeC,' nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air .  the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl .  the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met .  if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should .  cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he s going to have to do something to keep himself entertained .  and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona s h . i . mcdonnough .  cage should have known what he was getting himself into .  he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there s one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it s that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production .  the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage s performance .  in the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time .  that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness .  while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage s goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact .  audiences , too , should know what they re getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production .  in fact , the marketing people are counting on it .  no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded .  director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab s soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it s perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) .  what he doesn t deliver is a moment of suspense .  a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock s notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely .  if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air s creepiest set-up .  at a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool .  their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) .  in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts .  it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance .  while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep .  his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies .  it doesn t bode well for cage s appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over .  there s a word for people like you , nicolas .  that word is called recidivist . . . repeat  offender .

negativeC,' it s always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half-asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film .  that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians , a cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans , and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression .  indeed , walt disney is rolling over in his grave again , cursing john hughes  name for making the original live-action 101 dalmatians , one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time , and now its sequel .  the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor , 101 dalmatians .  the original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office , spawned a torrid collection of " collectible " items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal-marts across the country , and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas .  well , it s been about four years since then , and dalmatian fever is coming back , and this time it s digitally enhanced .  here s the story .  cruella de vil ( glenn close ) is released from prison due to the " cure " of her puppy homicide urges by one dr . pavlov .   ( oh , how witty . )  she rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film .  cruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again .  a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula .  at this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater .  how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film s villain ) sunk in the film business ?  it s almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon .  and depardieu . . .  how can a french guy have a bad french accent ?  and never mind the toilet brush haircut .  the only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent ( courtesy of eric idle ) that thinks he s a rottweiler .  now that s funny .

negativeC,'  " the animal " is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling .  it s clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill .  there are certainly better things you can do with your time .  actually , if you ve seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments .  the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer .  but he s afflicted with loser-itis .  dogs attack him , neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co-workers ignore him .  truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we d probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun .  this is actually bad because you can t like a character if you can t develop sympathy for him .  we never do , and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor .  however , marvin is found by an eccentric doctor ( michael caton ) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him , implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs .  as a result , marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed .  he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body , swim with the speed of a dolphin , and can run as fast as a cheetah .  imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation .  with his enhanced abilities , he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him .  however , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn , and instead , marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic , sexual urges .  goats beware !  he also chases cats , urinates to mark his territory , or growls at his enemies .  what he should ve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich .  equally tenuous is its other running joke , which involves one of his friends ( guy torry ) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he s black .   " it s reverse racism , " he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything .  this element doesn t work the first time it s mentioned , and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence .  you don t have to be as wise as an owl to realize that " the animal " is tame .  if there s any reason to see this film , it s to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut .  remember her ?  she was voted off in week 11 of the 13-week program , " survivor . "  here , she plays marvin s sunny love interest .  while her role required very little actual acting , she seemed very comfortable ( even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog . . . yuck ! ) .  with her adorable disposition , radiant smile , and playful innocence , she could be a meg ryan in the making .  it s too bad that she s in such a mediocre offering '
negativeC,' romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant .  with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination .  those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay .  call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don t seem to mix well .  gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife .  his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn t provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character .  jack has become addicted to " feeding the hole " , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money .  when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out .  gary oldman s performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored .  in the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider .  demarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world .  this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2 . i can t remember seeing a character quite like her .  after being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety .  what a woman !  lena olin s performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film .  anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo s wife .  there is little insight into her character .  she s depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house .  juliette lewis , as romeo s girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms . lewis  portrayal certainly didn t improve it .  both women were anything but sexy or attractive .  poorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems .  it is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something .  for example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene .  fine .  jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite .  fine .  what does jack proceed to do ?  he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn t feeling well , then strolls over to the boss .  why ?  the boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack s toes by the gravesite .  i guess they weren t worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral . . . .  or here s another : demarkov set-up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw .  she proceeded to set the place on fire .  wouldn t the flames burn off the fingerprints ?  aren t dental records more important ?  as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , couldn t she come up with a better plot ?   ( and it took her no time at all to get a good-fitting , functional prosthesis . )  lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film .  this film doesn t even add up the large details .  there is little or no consistency in the story-line .  not much makes sense .  the direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable .  the moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one .  so while it certainly isn t reservoir dogs , it certainly isn t diva .  there s plenty more to tear apart in this film .  my advice to someone who hasn t seen it to to wait until it comes on video .  there are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously .  it s not a boring film , just not a good one .  or an intelligent one . '
negativeC,' 54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring .  a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors .  i , however , would rather cut to the chase .  54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring .  there is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight .  there is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots .  and it s underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they re in this year s boogie nights .  they are so wrong .  the picture has been assembled by mark christopher .  based on this film , i don t know how he got a job in the business .  54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s .  i don t know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson s brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography .  what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes .  54 can t even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining .  it s remarkably bad timing , i d say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind .  i have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance .  that character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves .  steve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself .  alas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell s homosexual impulses .  it s here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell ) .  shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life .   ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen . )  but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs .  why his " friends " push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are " friends " is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he s been elevated to bartender status ) .  there isn t a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works .  most of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane .  there s a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they re arm-in-arm without a bit of development .  then , they re kissing in a bowling alley !  this is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn t a long film to begin with ) .  campbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth .  this one doesn t .  and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg s star-making role in boogie nights .  he seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone .  i guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me .  he s all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn t help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters .  by the end of 54 , shane s most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent .  the rest of the performances are wasted .  hayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here .  meyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard .  only myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher s wading-pool of a script .  rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance .  in fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him .  i ve read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail .  frankly , i don t care .  it s easy to recreate something technical like this .  a fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task .  besides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway .  aside from myers  performance , 54 is a complete failure .  it s dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring .  some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they re so obvious to me .  in any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast .  it doesn t even work as mindless entertainment : it s so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it .  so , don t forget those key words : dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring .  everything else i said was just padding .

negativeC,' an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer .  you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage , which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it s hollywood existence .  when i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys .  the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves .  all of the monkeys combine their efforts , hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark s office .  the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark s desk while flailing his arms and shrieking .  the director appears to be deep in thought , until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it ! ! !    the writing behind this project is embarrassing .  for your amusement , i will explain the plot .  dr . kinder ( kathleen turner ) and dr . heep ( christopher lloyd ) are two of the cold-hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute , where peculiar studies are going on .  as the story goes , there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ( ages 2 and under ) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences .  when they move past this phase , they become like any other drooling toddler .  kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies , namely little sylvester ( sly for short ) , who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission : impossible team .  there is so much crap derived from this premise , despite the fact it s virtually identical to the plot in look who s talking !   ( a far superior film in any league ) .  you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene .  sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung-fu tactics .  question : it s obvious the babies are super-smart , but why are they able to fight like jackie chan ? ?  the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers .  it s a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes  familiar home alone formula .  i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90 s knowledge , quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors .  the effects in baby geniuses ( similar to the talking animals in babe ) are pathetic , the editing is a disaster , and the jokes are never funny .  the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute  .  i suppose they are .  i can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute .  other instances , though , i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script .  there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever ; their entire existence is based on punch lines .  peter macnicol and kim cattrall , as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester s twin , are both miscast .  then again , i don t suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid .  meanwhile , dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench ( hahaha ) .  i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs .  instead of watching this , i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling .  or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark-infested waters .  anything to avoid this painful movie .  the final line in the film , spoken by the bratty sylvester , is `if they think i m doing the sequel for less than $20 mill , they re nuts  .  sequel ?  please have mercy .

"  we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 , which seems to be the  logical  place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries .  the chosen woman is christine york ( robin ) .  it is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise-cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd , and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest , thomas aquinas , arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot .  he , nevertheless , can speak and tells arnold an  end of days  is coming as prophesized in revelations .  but satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of  the end of the world  on his body .  it is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman .  he quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her , as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues , people jumping out of windows , satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnold s partner as the piss explodes like gasoline , satan being fired at . . . resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing , as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it .  there is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs -- including the subway , churches , and luxury buildings .  the only trouble with all these high-budget action sequences , was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value .  the story was so terrible and inaccurate , that it did not have an iota of value or credibility .  mercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square , trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 .  why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil s number " 666 ,    well !   . . .  satan s numeral is actually " 999 ,    which is upside down of " 666 .     accordingly , you just put a " 1   in front of it-- and bingo -- you get " 1999 .     with logic like that , this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer s eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult .  this film should become a classic used by film schools in how not to make a horror film .  i highly recommend seeing it for that purpose .

"  in the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom .  i won t give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows . . .  you ll figure it out .  the movie screams to be made with camp , and that could ve been fun .  but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better .  what a mistake .  the brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie s first music video -- go over like lead balloons .  instead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah s most dramatic scenes .  which brings us to the performances , of which there s nothing good that can be said .  mariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face .  she actually looks scared during her one love scene .  but you have to wonder if the writing isn t even worse .  so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey s virginal target audience that it s probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb .  even the characters couldn t have been written more absurdly .  they re all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , " billie , i d love to put you in a movie i m making , " and the big-time record executive who takes billie s demo tape and says , " oh , i ll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . "  everyone in the film is a device , and it s painful to keep watching just to see another one appear .  to say more would be a waste .  there s so much wrong with this film .  and , it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she s likely to get .  but , then again , i had to suffer through her movie .

negativeC,' poster boy for co-dependency needs patching  patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman  mediocrity is a pox on civilization .  in our heavily consumer oriented society , there is an enormous demand to churn out " stuff . "  what would happen to our economy if we didn t feel the need to have more things ?  to make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product .  the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality .  the film industry is like any other .  in order for studios to survive , they have to make money .  the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit .  some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used .  there aren t enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary .  for some reason , it s never crossed anyone s mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit .  often , mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones .  at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies .  i m not suggesting that " patch adams " was tossed out just to rake in the bucks .  my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel .  it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story , but it s as dull as could be .  hunter " patch " adams  ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis .  checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around .  patch could be a poster boy for co-dependency .  he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn t focus on his own problems .  he decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia .  as a med student , patch s antics at the school s hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch-enemy , straight-laced dean walcott ( bob gunton ) .  the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he s one of the top students .  he writes in patch s academic file that he shows " excessive happiness . "  i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing .  there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies .  then it struck me .  it must be based on a true story .  the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute , a free clinic .  robin williams is an amazing actor .  while he is adept at dramatic roles , his forte is over-the-top free spirits .  that s what makes his failure here so remarkable .  patch is exactly the character he should be best at , yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat .  something holds him back .  most of the rest of the cast is two-dimensional .  for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings , it s curious that the ones here are cardboard characters .  peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person .  unfortunately he s in the film for only about two minutes .  the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene .  we re not left to our own emotional decisions : we re hit over the head with them .  shaved-headed children with cancer , an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh , a beautiful woman who can t love because of her abusive history .  when a group of students fix up an old house to use as a clinic in the andy hardy " hey , let s put on a play !  we can use the barn and my mom can make the curtains ! "  mode , they laugh and roll around while painting each other .  there might as well be giant signs flashing : " feel good now ! "   " feel bad now ! "   " patch " is a good title for the film .  it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of .  the full-of-life student fights stodgy establishment types .  there s a touching death .  then there s another .  the film doesn t trust us to get it the first time .  the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again .  worst of all is the final courtroom bit .  scary-looking old men sit in judgment of a man who only wants to help people .  the room is packed with patch s supporters .  williams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all .  it has as much emotion as his earlier statement " humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species " contains truth .  most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk .  shadyac also directed the first " ace ventura " movie .  oedekerk directed the second one .  need i say more ?  the real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases .  the film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care .  the " doctors are not gods " theme will resonate with a number of people , but it s so poorly produced that no one will care .

negativeC,' young einstein is embarrassingly lame , but that didn t stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia , where it became the third largest box office hit of all time .  in the u . s . , warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan , inxs , and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under .  personally , i m hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb .  young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious , who not only wrote , produced , edited , and directed the film , but also starred and did his own stunts .  his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you d expect from someone named yahoo .  the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein s youth .  whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany , the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania , a remote australian island .  in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity , albert invents surfing , bubbles in beer , and the electric guitar .  yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick--a clown with an insatiable curiosity .  although yahoo s performance is at first endearing , the one-dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e=mc2 .  yahoo has created a charming family for albert , and the scenes on tasmania are often clever .  but after the first twenty minutes , the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy .  young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot .  yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack ; unfortunately , the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing .  almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video .  the instrumental score , on the other hand , is generally playful ; yahoo uses such classics as the " 1812 overture " and the theme from the good , the bad and the ugly to great comic effect .  halfway through young einstein , i knew for sure the movie was a stinker .  but it wasn t until the very end that i finally put my finger on why : the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies ( such as young sherlock holmes ) but from cheesy prime-time sitcoms .  in fact , young einstein might have been more at home on network television , where its sophomoric humor wouldn t raise any eyebrows .

negativeC,' this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james .  dick turpin ( sid james ) and his gang which includes harriett/harry ( barbara windsor ) and tom " doc " scholl ( peter butterworth ) , terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies : " stand and deliver ! "  owing to the increased occurrence of turpin s robberies , captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners ( kenneth williams ) and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp ( jack douglas ) visit turpin s area of influence to bring him to justice .  they are under the express orders of sir roger daley ( bernard bresslaw ) .  their intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin ( sid james ) , whom they confided in earlier , they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies .  however , once they catch harriett and put her in jail , and sir roger daley takes complete charge , it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin .  then again , sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable ( kenneth connor ) to keep an eye on their prisoner !  there is no doubt that this is a  sid james  carry on movie .  he excels in double roles ( as in  carry on- don t lose your head  ) and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious .  barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang , and hattie jacques  small but effective role as the rector s housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection .  jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on-screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part .  peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom , and bernard bresslaw s character appears only briefly in the film .  the only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree , who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the  birds of paradise  and sporting a fake french accent .  when her girls and her are robbed by turpin , she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit !  a carry on by the numbers , this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie .  the jokes are bluer , the script is poorer ( it is the last script written by talbot rothwell ) , but the music is a marked improvement .  although nearly all the regulars appear , they seem to be just going through the motions .  none of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here .  just a selection of crude jokes and repititive double-entendres .

negativeC,' one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb s runaway hit dawson s creek .  following in the foot steps of mtv s two other live action films , joe s apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace .  set in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john " mox " moxon ( van der beek ) .  we know he s smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook .  coach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him .  the star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) .  also on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african-american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin .  when lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies .  his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there s a big game at the end .  guess who wins ?  nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love .  there s a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow .  van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes .  also , the role isn t very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character .  he s still a pseudo-intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock .  voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out .  the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don t fare much better .  on the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 ) .  scott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team s wild man .  larter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film s most interesting costumes , including a very eye-opening " whipped cream bikini . "  it s interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r-rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) .  all this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson s creek , presumably the target audience for the picture .  director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger ( from nickelodeon films , a sister company of mtv ) and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression .  the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it .  the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out .  there s an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul , foo fighters , green day and aaliyah but it s not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film .

negativeC,' susan granger s review of " america s sweethearts " ( columbia/sony )  what a waste of a talented cast !  billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it s obvious that they re attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy .  the story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone .  he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film s once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they ll be so distracted that they won t remember they didn t see the movie or it wasn t what they expected .   ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! )  for help , he turns to gwen s personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts ) .  but the laughs are few and far-between .  crystal s glib , cynical flack isn t wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one-liners .  after six months under the care of a depak chopra-like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack s character s too emotionally fragile , lacking the necessary charisma .  zeta-jones s vain , narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one-dimensional .  only hank azaria , as zeta-jones s much-macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth .  basically , we don t like these ego-driven , stereotypical characters , let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements , and joe roth s direction is predictable , formulaic and telegraphic .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " america s sweethearts " is a contrived , shallow 4 . as a screwball satire , it s strictly superficial .

negativeC,' susan granger s review of " jeepers creepers " ( mgm/ua entertainment )  this nasty , little horror film begins as a bickering brother ( justin long ) and sister ( gina philips ) are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped-up bodies down a drainage pipe .  when long decides to investigate , there s nothing but trouble .   " you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it ?  - well , this is it ! "  philips warns .  what he finds in the basement of an old , abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying , jagged-stitched incision from his neck to his navel , plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies , stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry .  long flees but now the monstrous , winged creeper ( jonathan breck ) is after both of them !  eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle , a psychic who explains the evil creature s bizarre feeding habits .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " jeepers creepers " is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion , giving new meaning to the old song " jeepers creepers . "  and now - as paul harvey would say - for the rest of the story .  what s more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer/director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 year-old actor in california .  sentenced to three years in prison , he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992 .  when salva made " powder " ( 1995 ) , the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities , disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile .  and now , once again , in this mgm/ua film , that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio .

negativeC,' this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times .  it is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam .  it is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news .  the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn t mean much , since their relationship remained undeveloped .  the introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray .  ray is the only son of a low-level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield , new jersey , suburban basement .  ray sr . ( vincent ) is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home-repair business .  his son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman , dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his long-time waitress girlfriend joanne ( sybil ) .  the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film . you  should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don t make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them .  desperate to make his dream come through , ray goes to a loanshark , humorously and menacingly played by james e . moriarty , and borrows 10 grand to bet on a " sure thing " at freehold raceway .  the horse loses and now ray has big problems , as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough .  there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray .  he is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid .  so when his best friend mike ( gallagher ) , the narrator of the film , gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend--who cares ?  the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do .  as for ray s gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen .  his buddies , the college student mike and the dependable butchie ( gillan ) , and his old man , who he has this love/hate relationship with , rally to his aid .  and the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity , that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films , as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together .  there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star .  because of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of sean penn .

negativeC,' come on hollywood , surprise me .  stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset .  the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls .  personal , because his niece is one of the victims .  it s a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there s a twist .  freeman notes that each of the young women who ve disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl .  we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to " dominate " these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem .  anyway , one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to . . . well ,  you know the rest .  a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants , may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story .  perhaps , but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue .  so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further , okay ?  and as for comparisons to seven . . . oh  please !  kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass .  maybe the novel was a stinker to start with , but whatever the case , it s the writing that s clearly at fault here .  one , these characters have very little to say that s engaging or interesting .  two , the script has no sense of humour .  three , while the notion of a psycho s victims being smart , successful women is an interesting twist , the execution isn t even half as good as the idea .  thus , ashly judd comes across all out of focus , instead of being the heart of the story .  we can t feel her rage .  some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she s the no-bullshit 90 s type , but these conversations barely register .  and as for freeman , kiss the girls is his second dog in a year : first chain reaction , now this .  for an actor of his calibre , this is most worrying .  young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction-esque things to do in denver when your dead .  but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this ?  not much , and you can hardly blame him .  there s a few well-staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls , dives and jumps , and the effect is startling .  but the script is beyond rescue .  what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe , safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up .  complacency rules : it s been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters , real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue .  the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie , positive proof that the best things in life aren t free . . . .   .

negativeC,' capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence .  visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver s travels and treat it as an action film .  that makes it a film without much center .   , 0 ( -4 to +4 )  pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire .  it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver s travels .  humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift s island of the houyhnhnms .  the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet .  it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that .  when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish .  the final irony of the original version has become film history .  without it there could never have been a " planet of the apes " film series .  i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language .  in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language .  that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking .  serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film .  justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending .  but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear .  few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history .  partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith s best if not his best .  when the film s success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s .  while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases .  the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 .  now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again .  for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton s new version is even less faithful .  first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes .  he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes .  that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes .  as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring .  in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world s most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes .  then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet .   ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . )  he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks .  and the language they talk is earth- english .  apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that .  the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film .  both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english .  in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships .  outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic .  leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter .  ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power .  she is bent on making the world a better place .  perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari .  in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film .  she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward .  it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes .  this is a further abandonment of the source material .  the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each s place in this reversed society , each important in the book .  we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down .  we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them .  burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn .  this is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in .  they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win .  the 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like " i never met an ape i didn t like , " but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character .  most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals .  the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog .  this tends to limit close looks at the makeup .  in general it seems much improved from 1968 .  the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version .  in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper .  it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion .  chambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker .  today audiences have higher expectations ; baker s visualization is really an improvement .  these visuals work nicely .  what does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make .  they look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon .  apes spring incredible distances .  some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost .  one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up .  since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up .  the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti .  it is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes .  but he delivers them very well .  he was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom .  as the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well .  in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen .  he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov s performance in spartacus .  as an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself .  danny elfman s score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic .  that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten .  i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

negativeC,' i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3 .  the best way i can put it is that it s funky .  i know this is an odd question , but remember the opening music of " police academy 4 : citizens on patrol " , when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song " citizens on patrol " during the opening credits ?  it s just like that .  anyway , part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2 ( so technically still 1985 ) .  this time , a group of horny teens ( who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason ) head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed .  it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life ( which must have been between parts 1 and 2 ) so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me .  she s the lone survivor this time .  part 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3-d , and from what i can tell from the video , it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects .  jason had long , wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2 . now , one day later he s completely bald .  also , it being one day later , it can t be friday the 13th now can it ?  oh well .  steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series .

negativeC,' jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today .  from time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances .  on the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis  king kong .  and , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality .  hush is one such example .  lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn t such a prime example of motion picture tedium .  the film opens , as many so-called " psychological thrillers " do , by posing as a light drama .  we are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks  that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love .  jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) .  the moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs .  soon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) .  once that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives .  as long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it s a declaration of war .  hush has three very simple problems : it s incredibly dumb , it s incredibly boring , and it s incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) .  this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow s bare buttocks .  frankly , it s embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange s stature give a performance like this -- it s like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) .  meanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object .  as in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn .  here , it s mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle .  of course , since schaech s character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it s impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation .  maybe someone should ask him if he s familiar with oedipus .  martha is , of course , the evil one .  how do we know she s evil ?  she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work .  on the other hand , helen is a good girl .  the evidence for this is that she s nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents .  that s about it for character development .  beyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists .  however , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying .  i can t imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion .  either there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script .  before the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it .  viewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is .  cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable .  most entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren t especially good .  films like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along .  in general , however , they re directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension .  that s not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care .  indeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid .

negativeC,' synopsis : sonny koufax ( adam sandler ) is a rich , childish , angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa ( kristy swanson ) .  in a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin ( jon stewart ) and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian ( cole and dylan sprouse ) while kevin is on an overseas trip .  under sonny s supervision julian soon learns to lie to women , tell people how he " wipes his ass , " throw tantrums , and scream for his " god damned " treats .  self centered , julian breaks a school classmate s arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong .  meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk , food , toys , and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform .  not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny s incompetent supervision , and this leads to a custody battle .  opinion : it s a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk , and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior .  that s the essence of big daddy .  but there s a bigger issue involved : marketing .  movies that are rated pg and pg-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below .  on tv , film clips advertise these movies as family-friendly hit comedies .  then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard - - or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment .  folks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff , but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation .  to many american mothers there s probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a woman s " ice cold tits .

negativeC,' certainly no one would rent ed wood s glen or glenda ?  expecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn t know was possible .  in fact , wood s infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison .  watching glen or glenda ?  i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious .  the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend s clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) " not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time . "  the camera work is terrible-occasionally the camera lingers on , say , a closed door while the characters talk off-screen , or inexplicably zooms in on someone s ear or nose .  wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage , which leads to voiced-over non-sequiturs like , " yes , our world is a busy and frightening place , with so many people driving their automobiles . "  finally , there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines such as , " people .   .   .  all with their own thoughts .   .   .  their own ideas .   .   .   . "  while lightning crackles quasi-ominously overhead .  had wood continued in this vein , glen or glenda ?  probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror-movie touch .  unfortunately , he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script .   " pull the string !  pull the string ! "  announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears .  there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns , this time warning us , " beware .   .   .  beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door !   .   .   .  it eats little boys .   .   .  and puppy dogs  tails .   .   .  and big fat snails ! "  a bizarre nightmare sequence , which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid , ensues , during which glen/glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree-in the living room .  someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister " green dragon " ( but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series ) appears to be orchestrating all this , though the film is far from clear on this point ( to put it kindly ) .  near the end of this scene-and here i must confess that wood lost me completely-is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music .  after this scene ends ( not a moment too soon ) , glen or glenda ?  returns to its documentary style , but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone .  the film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism , but at that point it didn t matter much what happened .  as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over , glen or glenda ?  had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen .  i honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could , it still might not match glen or glenda ?  for sheer cinematic disaster .  i am giving this movie an f , but i m not sure that quite does it justice .

negativeC,' the second serial-killer thriller of the month is just awful .  oh , it starts deceptively okay , with a handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work .  after a baby-sitter gets gutted in the suit- ably spooky someone s-in-the-house prologue , parallel stories unfold , the first involving a texas sheriff ( r . lee emery ) , a gruesome double murder , and the arrival of a morose fbi agent ( dennis quaid ) on the eve of voting for the local lawman s reelection .  the second pairs a hitch- hiker ( jared leto ) with a friendly former railroad worker ( danny glover ) .  they re headed west , toward the rockies and away from the murder scene .  which one is the killer ?  well , it doesn t really matter ,  cause when writer/first-time director jeb stuart ( die hard ) finally spills the beans , you won t take his choice seriously anyway .  the whole thing goes south about an hour in , with the tale taking hairpin turns that i certainly couldn t follow .  and through the whole thing there s quaid , playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea- gal .  i guess i m glad that i didn t walk out-- there s some nice train stuff at the end and a fun nod to dr .  strangelove .

negativeC,' this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup , and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film .  no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story .  however , even if one thinks of it as fiction , " the prince of egypt " remains shallow .  but i ll begin from the beginning .  the biggest difference between the original , biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible , whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero .  maybe it s just me , but if i knew i had god on my side , i d have a little bit more confidence .  there are other differences as well , such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoah s death like it s nothing but a thing .  most of all , though , the story s focus has shifted .  rather than being a story about father-son , man-ethnicity , man-god , " the prince of egypt " is almost solely about the brother-brother relationship between rameses and moses .  i was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie , where it came off as maudlin .  rameses and moses squabble like children and then , in the interests of peace , moses saves rameses  butt , even though moses was the one who started it . . .   * yawn * i didn t care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer ( which , of course , never happened in the original story - moses was exiled ) .  but enough about the differences .  let s talk about the movie itself .  it features a moses who , in the interests of making the character more human , lacks any divinity whatsoever , which isn t convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is .  it features a cookie-cutter " i-wanna-please-dada " rameses , who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes ( from schindler s list , among other things ) .  the film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the " new-improved " miriam , voiced by the ever-antsy sandra bullock , even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason ( here bullock is replaced by a singing voice ) .  speaking of which , it contains * very * annoying music .  it contains shallow writing .  it features extraordinary animation , which is one good thing i can say about this film .  most of all , it contains an attempt to commercialize , homogenize , and mass-market a story about a manifestation of god .  i am not christian , but i got the impression of blasphemy .  the writers and producers took a butcher knife and chop-chopped into the story . '
negativeC,' for " original sin , " the road to the screen has been rocky .  initially slated for release last november , the film was bumped twice , finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 .  advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics , generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands .  so is " original sin " really all that bad ?  yes it is , but the melodrama does offer some rewards .  the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a ( with angelina jolie providing the " t " and antonio banderas the " a " ) .  more importantly , the movie is entertainingly bad .  veteran readers know that , as a rule , i don t encourage people to patronize lousy films .  most of the time , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides , the " let s go laugh at the failings of others " mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable .  but things are different this summer .  quality films , to put it mildly , have been few and far between , so as far as i m concerned , it s fair to find our kicks where we may .   " original sin " will never join such treasures as " valley of the dolls , " " road house " and " showgirls " in the bad movie hall of fame , but it ll do until something worse comes along .  the film , adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel , " waltz into darkness " ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film , " mississippi mermaid " ) , opens in a turn-of-the-century prison , as jolie s character , slated for a dawn execution , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny .  the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like , " this is not a love story , it is a story about love . "  wary of local gold-diggers , cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas ( banderas ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america , listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers .  a practical man , luis chooses a frumpy looking lady , hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children .  imagine his surprise when his fianc ? e , julia russell ( jolie ) , turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo .  julia explains that she sent a different woman s image because she didn t want to be selected solely for her pretty face .  luis then confesses his deception , leading julie to state , with great significance , " we have something in common , we are both not to trusted . "  after their wedding , luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking , with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible .  jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun , although the filmmakers  insistence on using one of banderas  legs to cover jolie s crotch makes it look like he s trying to climb her .  luis , the stupidest man who ever lived , immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia , despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded .  his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up .  luis must force julia to write to her sister emily , who is frantic over her lack of communication .  shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird , it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck .  finally , when she cleans out his accounts and disappears , luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong .  incidentally , if you re afraid i m giving too much away , rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie , leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists , a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass .  along the way , private detective walter downs ( played by thomas jane , who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie " 61 * " ) turns up , hired by the frumpy woman s sister to find out what happened to the real julia .  luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist , having decided that if he can t have her , he will kill her .  oh , the pathos of it all .  the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story , adjusting their performances accordingly .  banderas is suitably impassioned , while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting ( and with those lips , she can really pout ) .  as for thomas jane , he starts off acting suspicious and cagey , then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness .  his most startling moment comes when , to prove his power to humiliate , he forces luis against a wall , verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full-on kiss .  if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape , show them this chilling scene .  and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler , show them " original sin .

negativeC,' one would think that david duchovny , star of the cult favorite " x-files " would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles .  at least one would hope so .  one would be seriously incorrect .  eugene sands ( duchovny ) is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake and work more .  it turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient and his license while under the influence .  ten months later , in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin , the doctor gets a chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer .  using a plastic water bottle and bar tubing , sands operates and saves his life .  smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom ( timothy hutton ) is impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate .  he kidnaps and then offers down-and-out eugene a position in his organization .  blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at a hospital .  sand s temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine again albeit illegally , big chunks of cash to fuel his habit and close proximity to the gangster s womanfriend claire ( angelina jolie ) , this film s babe factor .  the would-be big time operator is desperately in need of help .  on the run from russian mobsters ( the bad guys that seem to be all the rage in this year s films ) and trying to cut a pirate software deal with the chinese mafia , blossom is surrounded by blood .  after a few medical misadventures , the physician grows disenchanted with his employment .  an encounter with a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten to blow him away unless he " fixes " their dead buddy cements his feeling that he is in the wrong line of work .  when the fbi visits and forces him to become an informant , there is no question that he needs to be somewhere else .  oddly enough , these seem like they could be exciting scenes .  the film disproves that assumption .  then a bunch of other uninteresting things happen .  writing this only two days after seeing the film , its a struggle to remember the events .  you can take that as a solid lack of recommendation .  for all the coolness that duchovny exhibits in " x-files " , it s a surprise that his big screen presence is so lacking in charisma .  the doctor is particularly bland and dull .  even the cold turkey bit which is rife with dramatic possibilities come across as banal .  a little chocolate and minor sweats get him through heroin withdrawal .  like virtually everything else in the film , it s a missed opportunity .  the fox mulder detachment doesn t work here .  oscar-winner hutton s manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle on .  played partially for comedy and partially as crazed killer , blossom almost becomes real , but then sinks into goofiness .  most of the time hutton looks as if he s searching for his character and coming up empty .  jolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a three-dimensional human being before giving up and turning into scenery .  the most interesting aspect of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen .  the rest aren t any better .  michael massee s eccentric fbi agent never revs up .  one of blossom s henchmen steals a few moments of the show as a quirky gunman reminiscent of val kilmer s doc holliday in " tombstone " .  his two-gunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is the high point of the film .  but that 15 seconds isn t worth sitting through the other 90 minutes .  first time film director andy wilson ( known for his work on the british television series " cracker " ) appears to be attempting to jump on the " pulp fiction " bandwagon .  the best of these movies combine a sense of style and flash with significant substance .  the second-rate ones concentrate on just one of these aspects .   " playing god " does neither well .  the basic idea of the film is solid .  and then it goes nowhere .  even worse , it plods back and forth , up and down a long and winding road before it ends up nowhere .  fox fails yet again in his search for intelligent life .

negativeC,'  " i would appreciate it if you didn t do that again . "  starring jet li , bridget fonda , tch ? ky karyo , burt kwouk .  directed by chris nahon .  rated r .  it s no secret that martial arts film often use their plot simply to get from one action sequence to another .  when the fight scenes are enough to justify paying admission , there is no problem with this , as in most jackie chan projects and a lot of the hong kong actioners .  when they aren t , well , we re in bad shape .  kiss of the dragon , jet li s second consecutive american misfire , plays like one big miscalculation , and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment .  now before i start getting e-mails angrily touting the genius of jet li , let me explain myself .  li is as spectacular as ever here , and i don t think anyone would ever dare call his martial-arts-star skills into question .  the problem isn t with him , it s with the movie s tone .  the much touted fight-scenes here are filmed with such unflinching , unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch .  they re joyless , perfuctory ; li s rogue chinese detective is more of a killing machine than a hero , a terminator with a black belt instead of a metal skeleton .  but even the terminator in judgement day had a sympathetic side .  the plot isn t relevant , but if you re curious , it s some nonsense about a chinese law enforcement officer ( li ) sent to paris to investigate a possible drug ring and encounter a corrupt chief of police ( tcheky karyo ) , who kills people and does sinister things with no motivation whatsoever .  oh yeah , and li s character is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain and/or kill at the touch of a needle .   " kiss of the dragon " is the name of an acupuncture maneuver , in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victim s neck , somehow redirecting all of the body s bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately .  there s a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute , whose daughter is being held hostage , for some reason , by the villain .  this is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen , even worse than the one in pearl harbor .  there s no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it ; it s only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boy-meets-girl subplot .  kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson , whose screenplay the messenger : the story of joan of arc , for all of that film s flaws , was at least thoughtful .  i don t know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck , but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic .  i suppose you could call this mainstream , but i ll choose the bizarre any time of the day .  if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling , you need a story to justify watching them .  the filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy .  no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling , but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks .

" starship troopers , " loosely based on the robert heinlein novel , is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects .  in the hands of verhoeven , the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale .  to put it simply , it s a bug bomb .  in " robocop " and " total recall , " verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence , special effects and social satire , and " starship troopers " starts off in similar fashion , with a tongue-in-cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise .  things go downhill fast , though , as we meet our heroes , a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school .  inexplicably , johnny rico , carmen ibenez , dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square-jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial .  it s a veritable " alpha centuri 90210 " as we watch the love-smitten teens squabble in the name of love .  michael ironside plays their teacher , who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities .  eventually , the kids join the military , with dreams of glory in their addled little minds .  one of their classmates , carl jenkins ( " doogie houser s " neil patrick harris , ) snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities .  he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother s leg .  a long , dull boot camp sequence follows , enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the " showgirls " director s camera roams over their buff bodies .  finally , a full hour into the film , the war finally starts and we meet the enemy .  the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space .  they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears .  yes , incredible as it seems , the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts .  a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best .  sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary , but the close-ups are a different matter .  the insects have an odd , artificial look , like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating .  the attack scenes are intensely violent , as one would expect from verhoeven , but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension .  while the action is frantic , the military strategy , wildly illogical even by hollywood standards , grows tiresome quickly .  verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage , but the faux-jingoistic scenes of children " doing their part for the war effort " by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren t enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck .  one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here .  his customary one part satire , two parts ultra-violence formula is way out of whack , and most of the film just flounders .  in " showgirls " fashion , some scenes are almost bad enough to be good .  an intergalactic kegger party , with jake busey playing " dixie " on a green plexiglas fiddle , has a certain bizarre appeal .  a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm , enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug , but tells her hero that she doesn t mind dying .   " it s okay , " she gasps , " i got to have you ! "  and then , of course , there s doogie s mind meld with a bug .  it s possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel .  heinlein s pre- " stranger in a strange land " books were aimed at adolescent males , and " starship troopers " has the antiseptic retro-future look of late 50s/early 60s sci-fi .  the one cityscape shown is a jetsons-like gleaming metropolis , with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting .  the hairstyles are retro too , straight from the frankie avalon , annette funicello school of fashion .  ultimately , verhoeven s motives are irrelevant .  he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire .  it even fails to be an entertaining bad movie .  avoid " starship troopers " at all costs .

negativeC,' tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy .  robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss .  he goes into depression , and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual  ghetto  side of every american city .  there , lawernce attempts to steal his car , but to no avail , and is dragged along with robbin s on a trip to arizona .  there , they hold up a store , are mistaken for two other robbers ( just like in my cousin vinny ) and are chased by the police , and the other robbers .  of course , there s gags along the way , usually from lawernce .  although the film is midly funny , and quite watchable , there s something so horribly familiar about it all .  this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there s lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity , just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop , and pratically the same idea as midnight run .  it s full of all the road movie cliches , and even has a  comedy  car chase , which just seemed so eighties .  even the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin , or chevy chase , eighties comedy .  there also isn t much chemistry between robbins and lawernce .  in planes , trains and automobiles , there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy .  in nothing to lose , there is hardly chemistry at all .  towards the end the chemistry seems to work , but for the bulk of the film , there is hardly any ,  the director directs the film in a workman like fashion , but gets the jokes across .  and although there is no chemistry between the two leads , they give good performances on their own .  lawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance , and robbin s is alright aswell .  however , robbin s performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob s ladder , and the player .  in fact , if you want to see robbin s do comedy much better than in nothing to lose , i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy , where he is much funnier .  nothing to lose does have some funny moments in it , however .  the humour isn t particulary sophisticated , but if you enojyed dumb & dumber , you might enjoy this .  the characters in arizona are funny , and there s also a good scene where robbin s asks a shopkeeper which  threatening approach  was better , lawerences ( which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper s ass , and swearing a lot ) , or himselfs , ( which was speaking in a deep , scary voice ) but the gags are predictable , the lack of chemistry infurating , and the ending too far-fetched and  perfect   nothing to lose then , is robbin s first  bad  movie ( and hopefully his last ) , and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film .  he nearly ruined carrey s career with ace ventura : when nature calls , let s hope he hasn t ruined robbin s ( or even lawerence s ) with nothing to lose .

negativeC,' capsule : not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman & robin , but still horribly putrid , cheesy and ill-conceived .  this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons . . .  extended review : you know , about halfway through this movie , i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes , you d have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy , hong kong style martial arts .  beautifully choreographed by robin shou , who also plays liu kang , the fight scenes are both mind-blowing and graceful , acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep .  this is what made the original so fun , but unfortunately for the sequel , we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson .  instead , they got john r . leonetti , the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat .  not a good choice .  while the fight scenes are brutal and eye-popping , the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare .  the acting is sub-par , which i could endure if it were not for a . ) the director s style , b . ) the special effects , & c . ) the treatment of the story and characters .  a . ) mr . leonetti should go back to lighting , in my opinion .  i could say dozens of bad things about him : he way overuses slow-motion , he has no eye for action , he can t get even mediocre performances out of actors , and so on .  but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping .  apparantly , everybody can now fly .  hell , i m all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot , but not when it happens every few minutes , and is done so poorly .  better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena : warrior princess .  in short , they should have gotten paul anderson back .  or at least let robin shou direct . . .  b . ) unlike the first one , whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic , mk : a s special effects are bland , fake looking , and overall just plain bad .  i counted at least half a dozen times that blue-screening was painfully obvious .  had this movie been made in the 80 s , it would have been ground-breaking .  but in today s industry , it doesn t even look finished .  c . ) now for the _really_ bad parts .  i admit , i m an avid fan of the mortal kombat series .  the games are amusing diversions , an easy way to work off stress and anger .  the first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride .  this could have been a really cool movie .  it isn t .  the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers .  some of the plot elements are just plain stupid .  how stupid ?  take , for instance , how our heroes move around .  they use giants spheres the roll around underground , supposedly at thousands of miles per hour . . . oh  boy . . .  even worse is the treatment of secondary characters .  blink and you ll miss  em .  most characters had more depth in the video games .  if you thought batman & robin was bad about this , you ain t seen nothin  yet .  a good 75% of the characters are introduced , kick somebody around a bit , then either die or are forgotten about .  there s no explanation at all for this .  and for the final blasphemy , the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for , the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie , lasted about 3 minutes and then just sort of . . . ended .  it almost made me weep .  to sum it all up , rent it on video , and fast-forward through everything except the fight scenes .

negativeC,' in " the astronaut s wife , " charlize theron plays a young woman with a nervous demeanor , pixie-hairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly .  if only her name wasn t jillian , the makers of this embarrassing bit of sci-fi shlock could have come up with a far more appropriate title : " rosemary s species . "  what a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron - oscar-worthy in " the devil s advocate " - struggle with the lamest rip-off of a screendom classic in recent memory .  ok , maybe " the astronaut s wife " deviates from " rosemary s baby " turf for its set-up , which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan s minions but her possessed husband ( johnny depp ) , a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him , um , a changed man .  predictably , he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant , his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great " bowfinger " line about " alien love . "  theron s " advocate " character faced a similar dilemma , the horror there resonating strongly .   " astronaut " provides only artificial anxiety .  last year s equally noodle-headed " species ii " spun a similar premise about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth , but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage .   " the astronaut s wife " is grave and humor-free , passing its increasingly silly story off as full-fledged serious , right down to an ambiguous finale that isn t even going to satisfy those who ve stayed with it thus far .  here s a hint : it involves lots of water , electrical equipment , a special effect from " the abyss " and the tots who doubled up as adam sandler s co-star in " big daddy . "  draw your own conclusions .  director/writer rand ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights masterminded by legendary " e . t . "  cinematographer allen daviau , but too often favors the film s visual presentation over the story he s trying to tell .  this bodes horribly for each dramatic development , like the surfacing of a suspicious nasa official ( " speed "  s joe morton ) to instigate jill s slow and stupid comprehension of the truth .  his hyper-erratic behavior is probably supposed to give wife a paranoid edge .  instead , he adds to the phoniness .  theron and depp are certainly beyond this junk and will get other chances to prove themselves this fall - she as part of an imposing ensemble case in the john irving adaptation " cider house rules , " he in the lead of tim burton s eagerly-awaited " sleepy hollow . "  undeserving of such talent , " the astronaut s wife " manages to be derivative , dull and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs .  in space , no one can hear you scream .  but in a movie theatre , everyone can hear you snore .

negativeC,' for a good ten years or so , super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene .  now , he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo , ( who launched chow s super stardom in the acclaimed  a better tomorrow  ) by moving to hollywood .  i had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them .  chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt .  his final job requires him to kill a policeman s seven year old boy .  this he refuses do and runs .  however , he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job .  cue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot- outs which take place in various locations .  some thought had gone into making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring .  the car wash scene , i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked .  tut tut .  the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music , ( i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie ) and not on the content .  mia sorvino ( a passport forger ) is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun .  director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow s excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots .  chow s trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale ( which in fairness is quite good ) and there s not even a toothpick in site .  and as for making chow shoot like a cop , well that s damned unforgiveable .  to round up , the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow .  it would appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video .  this is not what we wanted at all , considering john woo was the exec producer .   ( did he have no say so at all ? )  watch  the killer  again and weep at the difference .  review by chris hill .

negativeC,' libby parsons ( ashley judd ) has the perfect little life -- a rich husband , a cute son , and a house on the ocean -- but when her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her sailing , she awakes to find him gone and her hands covered with blood .  just as she makes it to the deck and picks up the bloody knife lying there , the coast guard arrives in response to a distress call her vanished husband sent .  she s convicted of his murder , of course , and leaves her son matty ( benjamin weir ) with her best friend ( annabeth gish ) .  time passes , and the friend disappears with matty .  during their last phone conversation libby hears matty yell " daddy ! "  and realizes that her husband is still alive .  libby serves six years , growing harder and driven by the desire to kill nick ( based on the theory that because of the " double jeopardy " amendment she can off him with impunity ) .  when she gets parole , she s sent to a halfway house run by travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) , a former law professor who ruined his life with a drunk driving accident .  after a little breaking and entering and some destruction of property , libby jumps parole and lams it across the country looking for nick and matty .  travis pursues , naturally .   " double jeopardy " is a watered-down version of " the fugitive , " with jones sleep-walking through his well-worn pursuer persona .  although libby never leaps from a bus that collides with a train , she manages to get into a few nail-biters -- chased down the beach by a jeep , chained to a car that plunges into the ocean , sealed in a coffin -- that add some much needed thrills to an anemic , slow-moving script .  character development is thin .  travis  intriguing backstory is mentioned a couple times but has no effect on the story .   ( i think they only made him a former law professor so that he could verify the double-jeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick .  it s a long way to go for one line ) .  there s considerable sexual tension between travis and libby ( hey , there s something " the fugitive " didn t have ! ) , but it never goes anywhere .  libby is a tv-movie everywoman , but judd s intense performance draws us in and makes us forget that her character has no distinguishing characteristics .  this is judd s most prominent role to date , and she proves that she can light up the screen .  let s hope hollywood gives her more to work with next time around .  the quality of director bruce beresford s movies seems to depend on luck .  when he has a good script and a strong cast , he turns out oscar-caliber work like "  breaker  morant , " " driving miss daisy , " and " tender mercies . "  when he doesn t .   .   .  we get " double jeopardy . "  screenwriters david weisberg and douglas cook previously collaborated on " the rock , " a script which probably benefited from the numerous uncredited rewrites .  bottom line : ashley judd tries hard but can t save this predictable bore .

negativeC,' the swirling sick feeling hit me just a few minutes into " heartbreakers . "  ray liotta s character was making out with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office .  while scrambling to collect himself , he frantically shouted to her , " just wait a sex ? er , i mean sec ! "  i was struck by a wave of revulsion , thinking , " geez , didn t lines like that die when  three s company  was canceled ? "  over the next few minutes , as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous , i realized that the mindset behind " heartbreakers " predated " three s company . "  suddenly , i had an out-of-body experience as my internal way-back machine swept me to the mid-1960s .  all across america , the counter-culture was growing like wildfire , but there was scant evidence of it on tv .  while young people were challenging traditional values on the streets , frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home , sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special .  women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises and leered at their breasts .  on another channel , dean martin made wisecracks about " booze and broads " and peter lawford , decked out in love beads and a nehru jacket , purred suggestive one-liners as he ogled the go-go dancers .  the adults laughed and laughed .   " heartbreakers " reeks of that stagnant mentality , from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt s vah-vah-voom breasts to its leaden screenplay , which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sex-obsessed to realize they are being manipulated .  in addition to liotta and hewitt , the cast includes sigourney weaver , gene hackman , jason lee , nora dunn and anne bancroft .  i can t imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project .  perhaps they thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the  60s .  if so , they were sadly mistaken .  the story revolves around a mother-daughter con-team .  it opens with the marriage of max ( weaver ) to dean ( liotta ) , a new jersey chop shop operator .  having withheld sex until the honeymoon , max pretends to pass out on their wedding night .  the next morning , she feigns illness , sending a very horny dean off to the office , where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary .  just as the two are about to get overtly physical , max bursts into the room and catches them .  the " horrified " bride dissolves the union , garnering a healthy cash settlement along the way .  of course , the secretary was really her daughter page ( hewitt ) and the whole thing was a set-up .  the women move on , but an irs agent ( bancroft ) catches up with them and demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes .  in desperate need of funds , max and page head for palm beach to replay the scam .  their mark this time is william b . tensy ( hackman , in hideous make-up ) , a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking .  max starts to put the game into action , but page is so repelled by the old man ( and angry with her mom ) that she slips off to enact her own score , targeting jack , a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune .  complications arise when page realizes that good-natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart .  as if that wasn t enough , dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind .  the attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior " a fish called wanda . "  i won t bother to compare the two .  suffice to say that everything done right in " wanda " is done wrong here .   " heartbreakers " is soulless , inept and , at 123 minutes , at least a half-hour too long .  sigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts , but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters .  gene hackman is utterly wasted in a one-note , one-joke part that has him doing nothing but smoking , coughing and waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex .  poor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bland .  ray liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity and humor into his walking clich ? , but only a bit .  the low point in the film has weaver employing a russian accent bad enough to make boris and natasha wince , while doing half-assed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue .  bear in mind , though , that this is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing but low points .  if you remember bob hope specials with fondness , this might be your cup of tea .  as for me , i m going to watch " a fish called wanda " now and try to forget i ever saw " heartbreakers .

negativeC,'  " american pie " alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summer s attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple-ness and zany comedy .  it s about an a+ student ( biggs as " paul " ) who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora ( suvari ) a ditzy heroin-chic goth chick who has no ambition or self-respect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like " hick-boy " paul is .  so we ve got a fish-out-water formula mixed with meet-cute romantic comedy which ideally should make for a good movie .  unfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction by " clueless " auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film .  these characters are totally unrealistic and unbelievable - it s as if everyone under age 30 is a stoned raver .  there s no background or details to anyone or anything , it s just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each other .  not to mention the story itself which is virtually non-existant and contains so many plotholes it s like swiss cheese .  even the basic editing is bad .  if you re looking for a romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny .  i saw this in a packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all .  if you ve seen the commericials you ve seen all the " funny " parts ( which are all from the first five minutes ) .

negativeC,' last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning .  based on the famous 60 s television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west .  but it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again .  and co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects .  i mean , what could possibly go wrong ?  the answer is just about everything .  wild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate .  there are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression .  but the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it .  at square one , we have a bizarre case of casting .  will smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series .  my guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved .  smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him .  he s too much of a joker .  i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible .  what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office .  the plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists .  the trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent .  loveless has taken the country s top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns .  one such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right .  the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings .  unfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film s plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem .  wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works .  most of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival .  if it s one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it s the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered .  kline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot .  salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon .  branagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film .  but even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top .  rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is .  i suppose there s always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint .  wild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 .  but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office .  perhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith s name stamped on a summer movie .  after such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume .

negativeC,' at the outset of swordfish , john travolta s gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today .  basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers .  how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture .  swordfish is loud , violent and amoral .  it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life .  and how does travolta s gabriel plan to do this ?  by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists .  swordfish is a very cynical movie .  it relies on an audience s perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration .  the movie s plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you d actually see how ridiculous it all is .  this is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it s over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions .  the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government s computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign .  talk about whacked-out patriotism .  my objections to swordfish are many .  the body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort .  it s becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits .  another example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife .  stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl .  audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband s adult films .  thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve .  in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed .  then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel s henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley s daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel .  children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films .  there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well .  yea , it s only make believe , but that doesn t mean you have to tolerate it .  travolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel .  his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off .  jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings .  his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database .  his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate .  halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel s assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel .  swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel .  viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain .  and maybe that is the movie s underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive .  and that is not enough .  this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water .

"  as the movie opens , therapist catharine deane ( jennifer lopez ) treats a catatonic boy ( colton james ) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that s never fully explained .  after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert , catharine has no success to report .  meanwhile , killer carl stargher ( vincent d onofrio ) has claimed another victim .  his particular hobby is to kidnap young women , keep them in a glass cell overnight , and drown them .  he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach , then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning .  although carl s been doing this for awhile , he s recently become sloppy , and fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) is closing in fast .  not fast enough , though , to keep carl from sticking another woman ( tara subkoff ) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma .  from the videos in carl s house , peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction .  to save the kidnapped girl , peter has to find the cell before the end of the day , and comatose carl s not talking .  so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl s mind and find out where the cell is in time .  the focus of " the cell " in on the ornate interior of carl s mind , but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer-generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality .  for the most part , it s style without substance .  in his own mind , carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes , ming the merciless , as well as a frightened boy ( jake thomas ) abused by his father .  all in all , the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place , and i kept wishing i could fast-forward to the next development .  singh is best known for directing music videos , particularly rem s " losing my religion , " and " the cell " seems very much like a really long , really slow mtv video with the sound deleted .  singer lopez seems to think she s in a video as well ; she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting .  the premise had great promise .  the computer-generated world within carl s mind could have been a bizarre , surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic .  the first room catharine enters in carl s head shows this promise .  she finds a horse standing in center of the room ; suddenly , sheets of sharp-edged glass fall into the horse , dividing it into segments .  the panes of glass separate , pulling apart the pieces of the still-living horse .  this scene is twisted , disturbing , and thought-provoking , because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder .  another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath .  their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie , and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine s own psyche .  like sidney lumet s " the offence " or michael mann s " manhunter , " " the cell " could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator .  however , catharine s character is hardly developed at all , and lopez has no depth to offer the role .  bottom line : don t get trapped in this one .

negativeC,' synopsis : an aging master art thief , his supplier , and a young , buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be ( or are they ? ) in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium .  comments : this movie was boring .  plain and simple .  entrapment should not have been boring .  it stars sean connery , who can still carry an action film despite his age , catherine zeta-jones , a likeable enough film presence , and ving rhames , ultra-cool star of pulp fiction and mission : impossible .  it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears ( a current " hot topic " in the news ) in its storyline , which is set at the end of 1999 .  it has some genuinely well-staged action sequences .  so , what went wrong ?  plenty , unfortunately .  the major problem with entrapment is its script .  it has a been-there , done-that feel to it .  nothing seems particularly inventive or original , so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags ( it runs nearly two hours ) .  the screenwriters , for example , periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes ( i . e .   " 4 days to the millennium " ) .  this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci-fi film strange days .  the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning , which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth " surprise " revelation is made .  entrapment , in other words , relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character s true motive is , resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion .  the star power here is quite strong , but the viewer can t help but feel the actors are wasted in this production .  sean connery is given such mind-numbing lines as " never trust a naked woman . "  ving rhames  character seems like an afterthought ; he s not developed at all .  the camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zeta-jones s tight wardrobe .  this , in and of itself , is not bad , but , after a while , it has a juvenile feel to it .  at least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they re exploiting the female body .  entrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development ( sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her , in tights , arc and pivot around laser beams ) .  the tagline for this movie reads " the trap is set . "  it sure is , on those who spent money to see this movie .  entrapment really isn t that bad ; it is watchable .  i would suggest , however , one waits until this is on cable or television to see it .

negativeC,' the first image in " final fantasy : the spirits within " is a computer-animated close-up of a human eye .  it s a beautiful piece of work , remarkably detailed and quite convincing .  when the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye , however , things change .  the young woman has mesmerizing hair , although it hangs too artfully ? even by movie standards ? to be believed .  the facial features are more detailed than any computer-animation seen to date , but the result is more reminiscent of a very well-crafted doll than anything human .  she is pretty , but bland , and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a person .  all the characters in " final fantasy " are like that .  of the core group , the younger white men and women are all athletic , attractive and indistinct , like applicants for a tv reality show .  the black man is taller and burlier , and the aging scholar is bald , with wrinkles and a beard .  none of them appear to be based on individuals ; they all look like the products of general descriptions given a police sketch artist .  it gets worse when they talk and move .  why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi , he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth , coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll ?  why , for every fluid physical gesture , do we also see herky-jerky puppet-style motions ?  more to the point , who decided a full-length computer animated movie featuring " hyperreal " ( their term , not mine ) humanoids was a good idea ?   " final fantasy " is based on a phenomenally popular video game i ve never played , with a story straight out of japanese anime , which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed .  if you re a fan of either , please spare me your letters , as i will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials .  with an expression-challenged cast , " final fantasy " mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit .  the result is ugly , confusing and boring .  note : the following reveals the basic plot .  if you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie , i suggest you read it .  earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls .  most of our planet is devastated , with humans living in a few protected cities .  while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies , aki ross ( voiced by ming-na ) and her mentor , dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) , believe in a more organic approach .  they operate on the notion ( quoting straight from the press kit ) " that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained .  aki and dr . sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force .  the waves will , in effect , cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion .  they have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave .  they are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out . "  are you still with me ?  there s only a little more .  aki is infected with the alien force .  dr . sid has developed a method of confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her , but the defense wall won t hold much longer .  already , the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams .  aiding aki and dr . sid are the deep eyes , a group of hard-as-nails types that would have felt at home with the troops in " aliens . "  capt . gray edwards ( alec baldwin ) heads the task force that consists of a wise guy ( buscemi ) , a tough woman ( peri gilpin ) and a gentle giant ( ving rhames ) .  throwing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass : in this case general hein ( james woods ) , who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age , even if it destroys earth as well .  so there you have it .  like most of the anime i ve seen , the plot combines apocalyptic settings , lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality , all wrapped up in a save-the-earth bow .  but i m bored with apocalyptic settings .  i understand why so many live-action films employ them ? they re cheap ? but animated films can show anything , so why wallow in an industrial trash heap ?  the action scenes and shoot-em-ups don t satisfy either .  the humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can t bring them to life ( in fact , their efforts merely emphasize what we re missing ) .  aki is especially disappointing ; with her lack of expression and flat delivery , she looks and sound like a brunet version of weena , the eloi girl from 1960 s " the time machine . "  drab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jell-o molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces .  students of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind " final fantasy : the spirits within , " but i found it sub-par across the board .   " futurama " does more effective battle visuals , the kids in " south park " are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of " the outer limits " does better doom and gloom sci-fi .  so who needs this ?  not me .

negativeC,' plot : token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film " trio " from the studio , after they complete the " final cut " without him .  he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision .  critique : wow .  i really can t remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels !  the " comedy " in this film is pathetic , obvious and dated ( oj simpson jokes galore ) .  the plot is uninteresting , boring and bad .  the structure of the film is annoying , repetitive and pretentious .  the acting is pretty bad , especially jackie chan , who can t act to save his life .  the cameos are lame and seem forced , and the ending blows chunks .  all in all , this movie believes itself to be a clever , humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood , but comes across as a boring , stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite .  i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans , but this one bites the big one .  see it if you like to watch really bad movies , otherwise skip it , because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it .  luckily for us all , this mess only lasts about 80 minutes , and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead-faced detective .  by the way , is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn t have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over ?  who knows , who cares , this " satire " sucks the bag .  little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , the original director of this film , arthur hiller , also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga s alan smithee moniker .  this was after the film s production company , cinergi pictures , preferred the cut made by producer/writer joe eszterhas to his .  the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis .  eszterhas announced through the media during post-production that cinergi pictures didn t have the money to pay for soundtrack .  he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him .  he received 9 , 200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists , listened to all that was sent ( at least a couple of tracks from each record ) and compiled the soundtrack .  this film practically swept the " razzie awards " in 1999 , given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year , with no less than the " worst picture " award , the " worst screenplay " ( joe eszterhas ) , the " worst supporting actor " ( joe eszterhas ) , the " worst new star " ( joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer ) and the " worst original song " ( " i wanna be mike ovitz !

( it s no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year ) this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week , with some nudity stuffed in from time to time , just to wake up the audience .  have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies , one that you just couldn t help but switch back to from time to time , just to make sure that it wasn t part of some sick joke ?  well , this movie is exactly like that , only it isn t a joke , it isn t on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it ! !  i say again . . . what the shite were they thinking ?  okay , so where do i start ?  first of all , the trailer of this film gives away the movie s main plot twist , the betrayal .  so for the first half hour of the film , you re basically just sitting there , watching these two " lovers " go through the motions until the " betrayal " occurs .  whoopee , big surprise .  second of all , angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part .  why ?  well , it s like this : not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman !  i mean , it s like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining , well , the same goes here .  every look in jolie s eyes screams " psycho " !  then of course , you have the case of the " patsy " husband , a man who just can t seem to figure out anything in time .  i mean . . . how  boring is that for the audience ?  you re watching this guy screw up time after time after time , and somehow , we re supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude .  no , thanks !  and if we don t care about him , and we really don t care about her ( she s a beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film ) , who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film ?  well , i ll tell you .  the only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not i d actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled .  no suspense , no chemistry between the leads , no real love or passion , no sense of surprise , plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending .  so why am i even giving this film a rating of three points ?  well , it s actually pretty simple .  i liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score , but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolie s boobies ( that s two points right there ! ) and another one for antonio s ass ( hairless , just for the record ) .  everything else in this movie was pointless , boring and just plain stupid .  try imagining a soft-porn movie . . . but  without the plot !  that s pretty much what you ve got here .  a low point in the careers of both stars .  oops , i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue . . . god  oh mighty . . . make  it stop ! !  where s joblo coming from ?  american psycho ( 9/10 ) - cruel intentions ( 8/10 ) - eyes wide shut ( 6/10 ) - fatal attraction ( 8/10 ) - playing by heart ( 7/10 ) - under suspicion ( 7/10 ) - what lies beneath ( 8/10 ) - what women want ( 4/10 ) - whipped ( 7/10 ) '
negativeC,' not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie .  earlier this year , nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year s least likeable " comedies " called hanging up , featuring a bunch of annoying women ( ironically , lisa kudrow played one in that film as well ) who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves .  ick . . . real  sweet stuff .  but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer , with a film entitled battlefield earth .  i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film , even if it was on a " cheese " factor , as everybody , and i mean everybody else , pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time .  yipes . . . another  beauty .  so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co-starring the ever-versatile lisa kudrow ?  uhhhm , you guessed it . . . not  much .  plot : in order to escape major financial difficulties , a local weatherman hooks up with his ball-picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery .  but as more and more people find out about their scheme , more and more people demand a part of their winnings , and more and more problems arise .  critique : simply stated , i didn t laugh once during this entire picture .  for a comedy , it offered me a few smiles , a bunch of nincompoops as characters , a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow , in what can only described as a " sluttier " version of her character of phoebe on tv s " friends " .  this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be , but it was pretty close .  thankfully , the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits , dancing as the weatherman were left in the film s trailer , and not in this final cut .  and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far , beautiful , this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic , idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast .  foremost was travolta s character , who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie .  and for me , the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong .  he didn t fit the part .  i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role .  a cool , calculating roughneck with a certain hip , suave " je ne sais quoi " .  in this film , he looks like he s trying to be funny , trying to be bad , trying to be good .  we re not supposed to be able to notice that , and when we do , at least in my case , i consider it a wrong choice in casting .  add that to lisa kudrow , boring us with yet another one of her patented " dumb blonde " routines , but this time , dressed in sexier outfits .  michael rapaport , stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn t quite up at the same speed level as everyone else .  and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells , and you ve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize .  the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half-interesting and never really bored me .  i also liked michael moore s perverted cousin character , and i loved , and i say it again , loved the character that bill pullman played .  give this dude his own movie !  he played a lazy cop , a man who tries everything not to do any real work .  he fakes injuries to get off duty , tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won t have to fill out any forms . . . now  there s a base of humor .  sadly , the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film .  and there s not much else i can say about this movie , folks .  on the whole , it was lame , included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines , and very little of interest for any target audience .  but get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and i m there !

negativeC,' the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars .  producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars , sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze .  gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry .  cage is legendary retired car thief , memphis raines ( don t you love cute movie names ) , who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thick-headed brother ( ribisi ) from being killed .  seems a murderous crime boss ( eccleston ) with a fetish for wood ( insert your own joke ) hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive , exotic autos .  fifty cars , to be exact .  poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly .  if the cars aren t delivered in three days , bossman has a casket carved out just for kip .  literally .  if only someone could save him .  hmmmm . . wonder  what memphis is doing ?  in order to give the film some emotional heft , there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of . . . yawn , excuse me , dramatic tension .  shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe ( lindo ) who s looking to send memphis away .  will he catch him ?  there s old flame sway ( jolie ) , who had her heart broken by memphis years ago .  will they get back together ?  shortsighted , thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother , yet resents him for moving away from the family .  will they reconnect ?  raines old mentor ( duvall ) has long since left the life of crime .  will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life , one more time ?  can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first ?  i ll bet you can .  following the opening credits , which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos , we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis .  he s first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go-carts .  in a later scene , as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control , all the while making breakfast , a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions .  just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it , big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it .  looks like everything might turn out alright after all .  you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins .  that s about as strong as the characterization gets , which is a shame .  bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand .  monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis .  or maybe it s just the cars .  duvall trots out his ornery , but sweet old codger outfit .  i m sure he s still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one .  lindo projects a warm hearted , but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material .  the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones , who plays a mute accomplice of memphis .  without saying a word , he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie .  like a blast of nitrous oxide , he attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal .  too bad his minutes onscreen are so few .  somehow , bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept , poorly written movies , gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes .  every time something clever happens it s counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you re watching a movie .  there s a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot .  it s counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a driver s test .  imagine the yuks .  there s a segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick .  it s countered by the lame semi-subplot of a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk .  the ramifications are never explored .  then there s the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars .  not only is it stupid , but it s against the law .  this is a movie made of pretty , but tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction to move the plot along .  gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long it ll take for this marginally entertaining , but empty film to leave your memory .

negativeC,' first and foremost i think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating it s been given .  for those of us who haven t read the james lee burke novel that heaven s prisoners is based on , do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts , feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps , gangsters with louisiana accents , plots , sub-plots , more plots , and well , really just want to see teri hatcher naked , this is one movie you re going to worry the price of admission over .  hopeful still ?  well , let me share my moment of sheer panic , and then the cold enervation of the big let-down when a semi-robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin , " what do you think of my butterfly ? " .  butterfly ? ,  i asked myself , what butterfly ? !  and then it hit me . . .  the scene had been snipped !  damn you , godless pg rating , show us her butterfly ! !  we want to see the goddamn butterfly ! ! !  so . . .  no naked teri hatcher .  forget about that .  okay ?  now . . .  heaven s prisoners is about ex-alchoholic ex-cop dave robicheaux ( alec baldwin ) who s trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and boat hire business with his loving , down-to-earth wife annie ( kelly lynch ) .  everything dull , but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while they re on their boat .  the plane nosedives into the water and sinks , but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixie-faced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt .  what they don t realise is that the plane s pilot was also a drug dealer , and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter s erstwhile colleagues .  when robicheaux discovers this , he predictably , against the advice of his wife , a well-meaning dea agent , and two gangsters who rough him up , begins  poking his nose where it don t belong  , we know that the man deserves all the misery he s going to get .  the question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious , meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide .  as dave robicheaux , alec baldwin is fat . . .  no seriously , this is not the svelte , thinking man s hero of the hunt for red october , it is an out-of-shape guy who doesn t look too good in a roof-top chasing scene .  he s also unconvincing in the movie s dramatic moments , acting with what as far as i can tell is a steven segal-like economy of expression .  three-quarters of the way through the show , while you re probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle , getting drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up , you ll want to beat on him a little yourself .  on the other hand , mary stuart masterson ( some kind of wonderful , fried green tomatoes , benny & joon ) cast as a down-and-out stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air , with just the right mix of cynicism , warmth , insecurity and humour to be the movie s only endearing character .  eric roberts as bubba rocque , always believable as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box ( see final analysis , coincidentally also directed by phil joanou ) is believable here as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box .  and lest we forget teri hatcher s role in all this , this being her rather well-publicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tv s " adventures of lois & clark " . . .  she is totally ridiculous as rocque s manipulative and seductive cajun wife , coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who s trying to get back at an employer who hasn t been giving her enough days off .  it s probably safe to say that her day job beckons .  and at the end of our day , none of this is really worth 2 hrs and 12 minutes of our personal misery .  the flying inkpot s rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

negativeC,' it s amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest stand-up around but completely fall flat in the movies .  take adam sandler .  on the basis of his first two cds ( " they re all gonna laugh at you ! "  and " what the hell happened to me ? " ) ,  he s the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams .  but when you put him in front of a camera , it just isn t the same .  i kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation , but his latest film , the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal .  seriously , i m willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here .  in fact , i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic .  the first half hour generated not one smile in me , with it s scenes of emotional abuse towards adam s character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players , but also by his very disturbed mother ( kathy bates - what is the world coming to ? ) .  granted , after the film gets rolling , there are a few mild chuckles throughout ( i m even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice ) , but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for it s nearly hour and a half running time .  you re all familiar with the plot because you ve seen it at least a million times before ; everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions , in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves .  and believe me , i m not giving anything away by saying that sandler s team wins .  if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie , then god be with you .  the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobby s love interest .  i mean , they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose , but they do extremely well with what they are given here .  kudos to both of them .  my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin , who made a very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen .  rely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh .  or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have , like jim carrey did with the recent truman show .  with the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses , he just can t keep going on like this .

negativeC,' according to popular film opinion , a film s greatness is determined by time .  take for example " casablanca . "  great film , even today .  it s still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic .  another example would be " star wars , " which had a very , very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before .  but as i rewatched " independence day " when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wasn t as cool as when i had first seen it .  i had liked it when i saw it the first time ( * * * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good " escape film . "  but when i rewatched it , i felt cheated .  thus , the curse of the " event film . "   " independence day " is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once ( except for a couple kids - the critics , in this situation ) .  but after a while , this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one .  well , this kid is the " event film " in my little analogy .  and when i rewatched " independence day , " not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen , but i felt insulted the whole time .  there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren t sure if it s comedy or hokey drama .  one scene , you ll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch ; the next you ll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around , saying corny lines .  the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of " glen or glenda ? "  now this annoying kid s problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once , he shows he has no balls .  and " independence day " has no balls .  it plays it safe everywhere .  it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films .  the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of " star wars . "  i mean , isn t that devil s den ?  and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore s breasts in " striptease . "  they re these octopus men , boring freaking octopus men .  i mean , come on .  the aliens in " 2001 " were more interesting and you didn t even see them !  basically the plot is straight from a b-movie from the 50s : aliens come to earth and we wonder if they re hostile or peaceful .  okay , it s an interesting topic , but it s not handled greatly .  now they aren t and somehow a computer geek , jeff goldblum , figure out they re using our satellites as a countdown to destruction .  yep .  these aliens are not only heavily armed , they re stupid too .  they also use the same kind of computer as we do , but that comes about later .  the president ( bill pullman ) , who s under attack for being a wimp , decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent , and he decides he ll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered .  i don t care if it s bob freaking dole in the white house , get him out of there .  i don t care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol , just get him out of there .  later on , he s stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship .  i think it s time for impeachment for this guy .  he s more senile than reagan on pot .  then there s a cocky pilot ( will smith ) who is the only person to survive the counter-attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 ( the film s only sign of being brave ) .  his girlfriend s a stripper sharing a subplot with " striptease " in that she has to do it for her son .  come on , she has a fighter pilot boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance .  i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers .  she s also the few , the proud , the lucky to survive the igniting of l . a . ( as well as her dog , who narrowly survives ) .  there are some bright spots .  they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing .  the best one is when jeff goldblum ( nicely named david ) turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says , " good morning , dave . "  and they even played r . e . m .  s   " it s the end of the world as we know it ( and i feel fine ) at the beginning .  and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great ( he s a stereotype , but i just loved the man anyway ) .  but there are no real subtle comic moments .  will gets way too many one-liners and he has no one to play off of ( execept jeff towards the end , and the two do great ) .  as i said , this film has no balls .  it is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and that s what it is .  but after a couple months , we all move on to the next " event " film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure .  but at least the indy ones last for a lifetime .  this one s short on batteries .

negativeC,' by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer , it s possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one .  action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup .  audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film s sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out .  somewhere out there , maybe there s a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere s dubious charms , but i m not among them .  i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it s hard to understand why the rights were optioned .  sphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create .  with expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) ,  something this bad can t help but look even worse .  the last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year s batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received .  sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron s the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon .  science and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere s first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences .  attempts at characterization fall apart .  intelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel .  special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness .  but all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful .  this is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect .  i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film .  there is some promise , but it s all in the setup .  we re introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered .  when one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee .  on the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission .  together , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact .  for a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation .  the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities .  then , right around the one-hour mark ( that s the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever s left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous .  this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things " exciting . "  additionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who s more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don t develop much of a rooting interest .  it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience .  what about that a-list cast ?  not surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn t a person ; he s a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue .  dustin hoffman isn t lively or particularly good -- it s ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) .  sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat .  their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective .  then there s queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count .  i like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere s lengthy pre-production phase ) .  if that s the case , forgiveness is granted .  i m less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) .  even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton s credit as a producer disallows him absolution .  he was a willing participant in a creative travesty .  no wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year s cinematic wasteland .  it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap .

negativeC,' shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen .  it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies .  that is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort .  shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work .  the finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books .  philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london .  it is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan .  however , to directly quote the film , he has " cash flow problems . "  through a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts .  so , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production .  however , the young writer has a severe case of writer s block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well .  he has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate s daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can t seem to put words to paper .  then , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer s block .  there are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing .  the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it s author .  ironically , that couldn t be truer here .  the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors .  one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love .  so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character s name in the credits .  the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth s theatres .  joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though .  he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad .  gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well .  however , the supporting cast does almost save the day .  geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking .  they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links .  you will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn t qualify as real acting . ) .  and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well .  but not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances .  when all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained .  however , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn t necessarily quality .  and this certainly isn t quality .  perhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work .  simply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining .

negativeC,' at times , you d think edtv would be an entertaining film .  i mean , who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day ?  but this average joe , ed perkuny , ( matthew mcconaughay ) , is a sappy , lifeless creation that wanders around , trying to solve everyone s problems and settle his own .  mcconaughay is awful , especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans .  frankly , he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys .  he overacts in every way : his overexaggerant body language , obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance , and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life , and drops to his knee and cries .  the rest of the cast is very good ; especially martin landau ( as ed s step-father ) , who plays a cute role as the close-to-death old guy that makes all the witty comments .  jenna elfman is good , ( but a little overemotional ) ; her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films , i . e .  can t hardly wait , and krippendorf s tribe .  woody harrelson , as ed s brother ray , does his usual egg-headed role , with his comic wit as well ( he wrote a book entitled , " my brother pissed on me . " )  elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut , and dennis hopper , in a quick cameo as ed s biological father , is a nice choice ( ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show ) .  ellen degeneres stood out as the executive who , after awhile , decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec , rob reiner s opinion .  i hate to compare this film to the truman show , but the fact is , i was ashamed to see this movie .  it felt that i had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed .  edtv had no real wit or genius ; it was typical hollywood .  extracting the tv part of the movie , you have the simple plotline : man steals brother s girlfriend , girlfriend leaves town , man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on , slut breaks up with him , real girlfriend comes back , and voila , you have a romance .  i got so restless during this movie , i almost walked out .  the only reason it doesn t drop below a " c " grade is because of the fine supporting performances .  ad2am " i almost lost my nose . . . and  i like it .  i like breathing through it .

negativeC,' five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king s writings called the shawshank redemption ( 9/10 ) , writer/director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king .  unlike the latter film , this one is a big , long , laborious bore .  plot : a seven-foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers .  critique : this film is slow , drawn-out , boring , uninteresting , unexciting , predictable and topped with a couple of one-dimensional " evil " characters .  its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles .  the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward , unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about .  of course , much like all other death row cell blocks , this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be " misunderstood " , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guy who is evil personified .  and let s not forget all the guards on death row , who also happen to be angels from the heaven above , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified ( and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates ? ? ? ) .  am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film ?  or even more importantly , am i supposed to give a rat s ass about anyone in this film ?  well , if i was , i sure missed that boat , because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin .  furthermore , there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone s life to present this story .  in fact , the story is empty within itself .  i truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal , and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not .  wow .  how interesting .  the plot s utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film ( we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie ) .  whip out those thinking caps , kids !  hmmm , and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie-cutter " evil " guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity .  hmmmm , now think hard here , boys and girls .  what a crock !  i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three-hour exercise in spirituality , but unfortunately for me , it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging .  in fact , it was one big bore .  i didn t see the point of the movie , i didn t see the point of the story and i certainly didn t see the point in tom hanks  big double-chin .  all in all , a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work , especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour , john coffey .  give that man an award or something !

negativeC,' synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend , who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night .  while this is going on , the thug , the father , the boyfriend , and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter .  comments : to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement .  i m not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter .  suspense ?  family drama ?  humor ?  erotica ?  elements of each of these genres exist in the film , yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them .  instead , the babysitter is a dull , lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers .  i suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren t for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing .  alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer , the babysitter .  her character has absolutely no depth at all , and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters  fantasies .  everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends .  the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds .  the father ( played by j . t .  walsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband s best friend .  none of these fantasy sequences , trust me , are things that need to be seen , but we see them anyway , complete with cheesy , make-out saxophone music .  the thug , in the meantime , proves that he s evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason .  the most absurd character , however , is the babysitter s boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead .  the thug , in a manipulative , iago-like manner ( though he doesn t really need to try hard ) , manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking , smoking grass , running away from cops , and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes .  incredible !   ( of course , the boyfriend s original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger . )  if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful , then it fails .  there are surprisingly few tense moments in this film , and nearly all of them come at the final minute .  by that time , however , the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them .  no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception .  if the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous , then it also fails .  i found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed , at times , to be played for laughs .  if the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic , then , once again , it fails .  the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting .  finally , if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating ( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning ) , then it fails as well .  the dream sequences aren t erotic ; they are too brief and , outside of one very short scene , contain no nudity .  i can t completely trash this movie .  the first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film , and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight .  the other 79 minutes , though , are a drag .  silverstone s character , at the end of the movie , turns to her boyfriend and asks " what were you thinking ? "  i asked myself the same question , having spent 99 cents renting this turkey . '
negativeC,' working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith .  despite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) .  the problem is , of course , that there aren t many good roles available for black women .  take away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve s bayou , and all that s left is a chance to be someone s girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim .  as a result , for pinkett smith s first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo .  actually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s .  mayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is .  the film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith s woo and tommy davidson s tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren t forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags .  unfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i . q .  the situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of " free lobotomy " lab experiment .  woo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places .  her latest relationship , with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper .  now , her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she s about to meet mr . right , and that he ll be a virgo .  later that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo .  it s not love at first sight , however .  things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a " quiet " dinner .  in the one-hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad " white " movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it s only fair that we get a " black " effort of the same low caliber .  as in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together .  the question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ?  in a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no matter how familiar it is .  in woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project .  for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there s a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) .  sadly , that s one of the film s most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional .  despite exuding charm from every pore , there s little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson s script .  since it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops .

negativeC,' there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been .  the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 , where a one-time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets , fists stuffed into coat pockets .  to one side of him , residents scavenge for food in the street ; to the other side , german troops beat a group of jews .  jakob , however , never stops moving .  it s an efficient , effective set-up for the character , who is clearly nobody s idea of a hero at the outset .  he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision .  the set-up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior .  after a visit to a german commandant s office and a moment alone with a turned-on radio , jakob learns that russian troops are quite near .  when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews , they become convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the ghetto .  the good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes .  a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive .  this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the " ordinary person " in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams .  i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his " serious " roles with every passing year .  compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams , and see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much less sensible at choosing material ) .  jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he s struggling _not_ to craft them .  when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10-year-old orphan lina ( hannah taylor gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky .  oh yes , and then there s that little girl .  some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero s fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes aren t problematic because they re familiar .  they re problematic because they re jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn t have been about cutesy relationships .  jakob s character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina .  every scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people .  it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood-ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways .  director peter kassovitz , working from jurek becker s novel , crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from armin mueller-stahl ( as a once-revered doctor ) and bob balaban ( as a barber drifting into depression ) .  there are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it s the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams  incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl .  jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste .  and after one wonderful early scene , you can see the film wasted and fumbled away .

negativeC,' first troy beyer wrote the critically panned " b . a . p . s . "  now she makes her directorial debut , writing , directing , and starring in this sub-par film about women talking about sex .  though not without redeeming qualities , this film is bad .  the basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) , lena ( randi ingerman ) , and michelle ( paget brewster ) -- in their search for love .  jazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating .  she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami .  the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout , both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters .  the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film .  there are several moments of bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension .  in a low-budget independent film from a first-time director , these faults can sometimes be forgiven , if the screenplay is fresh and solid .  that is not the case here .  the script suffers from random plot developments .  there are four or five of these turns in the plot , each one raising the question " where did that come from ? "  at one point , a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother .  we are supposed to be moved , but since the scene is completely un-led-up to , we really don t care if she and her mother get along .  we ve never seen her mother before .  we never see her again .  who cares ?  what s worse , these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy .  at another point , a character announces that she can t have children .  apparently , this is devastating .  we wouldn t know this because she never talked about having kids before , but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her .  the scene feels like an afterthought , its emotion manipulative and shallow .  these scenes grow worse and worse , culminating in an absurd climax .  two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing .  one scene is a lover s spat between two minor characters .  the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax .  thinking on these scenes , it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities .  but it does .  first , it is original .  we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups , and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea .  it s something i don t think has been the subject of a film .  second , the interviews of the miami women are sincere .  taken together , they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners .  the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes , but each tile is some woman s real experience .  neither the picture of women , nor their picture of men , is truly representative , but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way .  at some level , the stereotypes that emerge can be called true .  i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their " likes , dislikes , skills , and thrills , " but on the whole , it s pretty bad .  and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension .  i ll give beyer one more strike , and then she s out .  rated r ( almost got an nc-17 ) for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity .

negativeC,' susan granger s review of " mulholland drive " ( universal focus )  whatever david lynch is selling , i m not buying .  from the writer/director of " blue velvet " and " twin peaks " comes another dark , mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive , the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills .  dazed , a beautiful brunette ( laura elena harring ) emerges and stumbles down a hill , slipping unobserved into a  30s-style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip .  the next morning , a dewy blonde ( naomi watts ) from deep river , ontario , arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase .  her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet .  the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust .  meanwhile , a hotshot director ( justin theroux ) , whose wife is in bed with the poolman , is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there s an assassin ( mark pellegrino ) roaming the city .  the tortuous paths of these various characters - and others named cookie , coco and cowboy - intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because , midway through the story , lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality , leaving a huge wad of cash , a blue metallic key , a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered .  elena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses , effectively making the subtle switch .  the same cannot be said for former m . g . m .  dancer ann miller who s stiff and self-conscious , speaking - like most lynch players - in staccato tones .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " mulholland drive " is a frenzied , frustrating 4 . originally designed as an episodic tv pilot , this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out .

"  the faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion .  there s not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing .  drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall .  making use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day-style but rather " through the back door . "  parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day .  the lack of gusto is the movie s major stumbling block .  even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they ve been saved by an energetic approach .  this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson s ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven-directed scream but couldn t pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer .  although he designs the faculty with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive .  on that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns .  only the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers .  perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they d all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la " dawson s creek . "  needless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be .  there is a moment or two of genuine horror , but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it .  in sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off . '
negativeC,' the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending .  watching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise .  when the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification .  this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more .  good surprises make movies fun to watch .  then there are the bad twists .  you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i m talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid .  screwed perfectly suits the latter description .  what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on .  by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs .  larry flynt , scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing .  whoops .  screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments .  norm macdonald stars as willard filmore , a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich , old , insidious boss , miss crock ( elaine stritch ) .  when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day , willard is convinced by his best friend rusty ( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock s beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars .  too excited to pay any attention , the hapless losers  plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home .  now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends , realizing they can make even more money , decide to stage the fake kidnapping .  of course , everything that could go wrong does .  the first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad .  but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear .  the more idiotic these characters get , the more reckless the script becomes .  at one point , i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters : " no , you idiot ! "  i m not just talking about willard and rusty , who were extremely annoying , i m also talking about the cops in this film .  a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys ( headed by murder one s daniel benzali ) were just too clueless to forgive .  they give real cops bad names .  also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days .  looking almost identical to his penguin in batman : returns , every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief .  he just didn t belong in this movie .  macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was , gross out humor is certainly not his forte .  if you re a fan of norm macdonald s other chaotic comedy , dirty work , you might actually love this near-sequel .  otherwise , don t get screwed out of your hard-earned money . '
negativeC,'  " spice world " is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls .  sure there s a hint of humor in there every once in a while .  actually , there s a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls .  but overall , who cares ?  not me .  if you don t know by now , the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power , yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood .  in " spice world " they ride around in their big tour bus , whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews .  amazingly , all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things , things they want to do , not things they are required to do to keep earning money .  and they keep babbling about " girl power " when they should really be talking about " cleavage power " .  i mean , if all it takes is girl power , then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits ?  the film is pg , but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions , you d have yourself one raunchy adult film .  by the way , there s something in the opening credits which says " based on an idea by the spice girls " .  wow , they got idea credit !  i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood . . .  giving credit for simply having the thought " say girls , let s make a movie ! "  the supporting cast fares well .  roger moore ( the real james bond ) mockingly plays the cliche-spewing " chief " of the spice girls , and darn it all , he s fun to watch .  mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band s manager ( richard e . grant ) .  one question though : george wendt ?  you d think that " spice world " would envoke one of two reactions in people .  if you like the spice girls , you ll like them even more afterwards .  and if you can t stand them ( like me ) , then " spice world " will really make you sick .  oddly , the audience i saw the film with , roughly 50 twelve year-old girls , sat in silence for the entire film .  well , not the two who sat directly behind me .  they kept muttering " this is stupid " over and over again .  maybe there is hope for humanity after all .

negativeC,' i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident .  they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail .  it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of .  frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know .  often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject .  film is a different medium .  it is a visual medium .  that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize .  i frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space .  the magazine article and the film script are two very different media .  the insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article " the man who knew too much " by marie brenner .  it is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film .  it really verges on being tedious at least at times .  for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects .  but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it .  the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco .  the tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking .  the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs .  who were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ?  that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider .  this all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well .  and in the end , he failed .  to make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short .  the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist .  we get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand .  they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) .  there the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it .  this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world .  terrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power .  incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home .  we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly .  he had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family .  rather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income .  meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand .  they offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data .  wigand s severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms .  he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman .  in spite of the secrecy , wigand s former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role .  and so the game begins .  wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer .  meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family .  the film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants .  wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out .  he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight .  al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider .  the story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail .  the film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience .  the musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory .  it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling .  also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace .  plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well-known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly .  this film might have been a really engaging experience under another director s control .  michael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style .  i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

negativeC,' i should have known , damn it , i should have known .  ewan mcgregor - codename : " eye " - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat , bald business-oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street .  we get the requisite electro-green through-the-sight view .  we the audience , seeing a high tech rifle-ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low-quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e-mail to everyone in his target s office .  all right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle/camera , but i was still open minded . . .  maybe there s a really good reason for it .  i ve got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor s previous work . . .  and he s obi wan ke- friggin-nobi for god s sake .  and director stephan elliot s last movie priscilla , queen of the desert was a quirky little delight .  there s some genuine talent involved here .  i think at the twenty minute mark , there was still a spark of hope in my heart .  eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization s son ( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ?  national spy ring ?  private investigation ? ) , who is apparently stealing from his trust fund .  he has received his assignment from k . d .  lang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase .  when eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard .  ok , that s odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting .  then she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims " merry christmas , dad ! "  for the first time .  so begins our tale of obsession . . .  or . . . something .  the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor s eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar .  throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras .  fine , that s a lovely premise , i suppose .  but gosh darn it , if you re going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation .  and that s precisely where this film fails .  this is the kind of movie that pisses me off .  it s an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end .  it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller .  here , the filmmakers have confused " surreal " and " deep " with " vaguely unclear " and " crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors . "  i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in " love " with this woman who changes wigs and kills people .  the movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense .  explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye s imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn t leave ms . judd .  explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : " beauty is in the eye of the beholder . "  whoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed .  that s as deep as it gets , folks .  there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib .  there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was .  my personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers  frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms . judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley s awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot .  each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last .  the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space .  any time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed .  bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass .  ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell .  jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally . . .  cut to random guy with eye patch . . .  iguana out of focus . . .  iguana comes into focus .  wow , man .  when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me .  there are plenty of elements here that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story .  and i wouldn t be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director s cut . . .  not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing .  the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition .  some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i didn t particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap ; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking .  someone near cell-phone-guy did eventually yell , " shut the hell up ! " , but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen . '
negativeC,' as bad as " mimic " was , it definitly scared me .   " mimic " continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style , and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie .  director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film " cronos . "  that movie worked because it took an unconventional story , unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie .  in " mimic " , del toro doesn t bother to give us anything original .  the plot is a stupid combination of " aliens " meets " species " meets " jurassic park . "  the characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies .  there s nothing new in " mimic " .  it s just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work .  at the end of the movie , you re stuck wanting your money back .  maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies : he forgot to turn the lights on .  i don t understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the " seven " trend and be set in dark , dank areas .  watching " mimic " i was tempted several times to yell at the screen " turn the lights on !  the switch is to your right !  use common sense !  just do it !  you ll be able to see the monster in the corner ! "  there s a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off .  it looked like the light operator was having a seizure , and sorvino didn t even notice - she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts .   " hmmm . . . .  i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight . "   " mimic " has a lot of incidental shock tactics ( boo !  just kidding ! ) and follows them up with the real scare , but nothing in this movie scares you .  the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments ; i think they were bored , too .  i shouldn t blame del toro .  he isn t the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie .  hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time , " the killer " and " hard boiled " then came to america to make the stupid " broken arrow . "  french directors luc besson ( " la femme nikita " ) and george sluizer ( " the vanishing " ) followed woo s lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies .  robert rodriguez , who directed the terrific low budget " el mariachi " came to hollywood and directed the horrible , high-budget " desperado . "  i don t know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country can t make a good american movie .  woo finally broke through and made " face/off " , but it still isn t up to par with his earlier films .  i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office , chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director , " welcome to america !  i bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long .  do you speak english ?  now , i know you think you ve made good movies in the past , but now you re in america , so things are a little different here .  just remember what the american audience always wants , and you ll be fine .  they want to see at least one big breasted woman , characters that they ve seen a thousand times before ( because change scares americans ) , and you always need a cheesy feel-good ending to wrap things up .  if you don t make that kind of movie , you ll be shining my shoes in no time .

"   " silverman " has its heart in the right place , but the story , by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul , is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren s soul .  based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake , the story is centered on the three , life long amigos .  when wayne introduces darren to judith , he doesn t realize that he has opened a pandora s box of disaster for himself and j . d . judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match .  since then , she has sought a new mate - someone she can boss around and mold into her own vision .  enter darren silverman .  once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement , wayne and j . d . try everything they can , including threats and bribery , to get judith to free darren .  nothing works until the duo come up with a plan - kidnap judith and get darren back together with the girl he called his one and only , pretty sandy perkus ( amanda detmer ) .  the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become a nun .  things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne and j . d . play cupid .  the boys even bring their idol , neil diamond , into the picture to help resolve things .  thinking about it , this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black .  the pair is able to elicit the film s only laughs with their goofy antics and child-like behavior .  they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task .  steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne , the " brains " of the gang .  jack black has the big-guy moves of a chris farley , giving j . d . an amusing physical presence .  the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material .  the rest of the cast doesn t fare as well , though .  jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do ; though having watched his previous films ( " american pie " and " loser " ) i m not sure what attraction biggs actually has .  amanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith .  there is no humanity at all to her character as she single-mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind s image .  she s a monster that wayne and j . d . must defeat to save their friend .  unfortunately , there is no dimension to her character .  amanda detmer brings nothing ( or gets nothing ) as darren s one and only .  r . lee ermey , as the psychotic coach , made a bad decision taking this role .  tune-meister neil diamond gives a good-natured cameo perf as the boys  idol and savior .  production values are on par with the rest of the film - lackluster and non-involving .  director dennis dugan has a track record for broad comedy with films like " big daddy " and " beverly hills ninja , " but falls flat with " saving silverman . "  the 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with a " good " film to sink our teeth into .  at least , with " saving silverman , " we get a couple of funny perfs from zahn and black .  too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor .  kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings of a good comedy .  i give it a c- .

negativeC,'  " an intimate , character-driven drama about a troubled youth at a crossroads in his life , " read the press notes for _reach_the_rock_ .  i m not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words bear little resemblance to the slow , completely uninvolving bore i saw--at least , it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film .  alessandro nivola plays robin fleming , a troubled , directionless 21-year-old who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small town .  police sergeant phil quinn ( william sadler ) takes him in , and what ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of sneak-outs and sneak-ins where robin slips out of his jail cell , breaks a window , then returns , all without quinn ever noticing .  also added to the pointless proceedings is some would-be humorous shenanigans involving quinn s dimwitted deputy ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend donna ( karen sillas ) .  with a half hour ( if even that long ) remaining , director william ryan and writer john hughes ( yes , john hughes of  80s youth films and _home_alone_ ) finally approach something close to a point .  turns out robin still pines for his high school sweetheart lise ( brooke langton ) , who has long gone on with her life , and hughes s main concern at long last reveals itself as a tired " live in the present and for the future " message .  most moviegoers , however , will likely be asleep by that time .  wide awake , however , is the cast , who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy and skill--thus revealing the _real_ purpose behind this listless enterprise : to serve as a series of acting exercises .  such a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors , but it leaves audiences with a booby prize .

negativeC,' synopsis : blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs .  in the meantime , someone sends sarah rotting flowers , puts her name in the newspaper s obituary column , and kills her cat .  comments : never talk to strangers , a colossal waste of time , moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film .  one wouldn t think that two genuine movie stars , antonio banderas ( evita ) and rebecca de mornay ( hand that rocks the cradle ) , and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller ( " saturday night live " ) would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey .  not only are they in it , however , but de mornay executive produced it .  what was she thinking ?  never talk to strangers centers upon sarah , a psychologist examining the ill-tempered max , a murderer soon to stand trial .  she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood .  two men woo her ; tony the " security consultant " wins her over ( so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music ) .  a lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder , but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah , and instead offers several male characters as red herrings .  86 minutes , the running time of this cinematic mess , thus , seem like 86 hours .  a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony .  why would the career-minded , professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony ?  that s one of the film s mysteries which are never answered .  regardless of motive , de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism .  they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally -- in one of the stupidest scenes of the film , tony takes sarah to a carnival that s * right outside * his dingy apartment ( that way , they can hurry back and have sex quickly ) .  also , apparently , the weather changes quickly in their locale : they re at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex ; the next day , they re out playing in the snow before having sex .  the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah s " character development . "  someone is out to get poor sarah ( though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts ) .  rotting flowers , a writeup in the obituary , and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her .  suspense cliche number one also occurs : whenever someone is stalked in thrillers , by any means , if the stalked has a pet , that pet will die .  oftentimes , to even further the cliche , the murdered pet is a cat ( suspense filmmakers , for some reason , just don t like cats ) .  sarah , in never talk to strangers , receives a package and , lo and behold , discovers her mutilated cat within .  suspense at its very derivative !  as stated before , never talk to strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornay s bodies as often as possible .  comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here ( he s not given lines that are suitable for his persona ) and doesn t even appear all that much .  maybe , in a way , he s lucky for that .  early on in the movie , sarah tells tony , after meeting him in a supermarket , that she had been advised to never talk to strangers .  allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker .

negativeC,' a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom .  there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i ve seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny .  the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can t get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story .  pen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var s " all about my mother , " but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face .  the best you can say about her , is that she s not to blame for this picture being so off .  this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will .  the story is all about the love , motion sickness , and cooking ability of isabella ( cruz ) , who is born in bahia , brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents  cook .  to cure her motion sickness , her parents tried every remedy , until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure .  she is able to control it now as long as she doesn t drive a car , ride elevators , follow in dancing , and is the woman on top when making love .  in other words , she has to be in control of things .  in her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter , toninho oliveira ( murilo ben ? cio ) and marries him .  they open up a successful restaurant , where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it , even though he s a loafer .  one night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco .  we don t see her in flight , so i can t tell how she handled her motion sickness problem -- unless she flew the plane .  she visits her friend s apartment monica ( harold perrineau jr . ) , who is a cross-dresser , blending right into the san francisco scene .  to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho , she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell , freeing her from ever loving him again .  her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff ( mark feurerstein ) gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show .  you can really write the script from here on by yourself . . . as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had , but things continue to go bad for him : there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village , there is no chef to replace his wife , as the restaurant is about to close for good .  so he comes to san francisco , figuring he can charm her again .  he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians , the ones he used when courting her , when he serenaded her under her window .  he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick , the yuppie tv producer chasing after her , and sees that she is no longer charmed by him .  when he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her , the ratings go up and he s hired as a regular on the show .  the show gets so big , that the network honchos come onboard , taking it national .  but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show , get rid of monica because he s a freak , have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses , and they change her ethnic dresses to low-cut vanna white type of sexy dresses .  cliff , her would-be boyfriend , acts creepy and sides with the network big-shots , even though he loved everything she did .  these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos , they were revolting .  it was an insult to one s intelligence .  i m sure that i m not spoiling the ending for anyone , when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again .  if the film wasn t terrible enough , monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers .  it was so awkwardly done , that it had no sense of truth or humor to it .  this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film , because it doesn t look or feel like an almod ? var film , the type of film it aspired to be , but more like a film that was interferred with from above .  its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic , as it searches for box office heaven .

negativeC,' let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years .  i am not too fond of ted turner s world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight .  the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show .  when they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt .  i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back .  when they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king s real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv .  king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king .  after convincing king that they don t care that his persona isn t real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw s pay-per-view .  gee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don t know where to begin .  yes , i do . . .  1 . the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans .  he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously .  he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously .  i got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 !  i know he ll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn t meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that s how big an ego bischoff has .  2 . there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon s screwing bret " the hitman " hart out of the title .  this movie s storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man s wayne and garth thrown in .  eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart .  3 .  the movie s main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him .  no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today !  4 . why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ?  i know wrestling isn t a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end .  5 .  in the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan .  what she sees in that freak marilyn manson i ll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king s trainer for sinclair .  wouldn t it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ?  i hate that .  6 .  last , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either .  the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons :  1 . they re the better promotion .  2 . they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers .  3 .  they give their fans what they want and don t treat them like idiots .  4 . they re winning the ratings and they re the promotion everybody cares about .  5 . simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way .  the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end .  and if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars .

negativeC,' battlefield long , boring and just plain stupid  battlefield earth  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  in my mid-teen years , i had a horrendous re-occurring nightmare .  behind the wheel of a car , i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert .  no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway .  no matter what i did , the view didn t change : travelling but not getting anywhere .  each time i awoke in a sweat , terrified .  you don t have to be carl jung to understand that dream .  powerless to make changes , trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue , this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake .  this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after " battlefield earth " begins .  for all of its flash and style , l . ron hubbard s science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000 .  dull " and " stupid .  in the year 3000 , the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1 , 000 years .  humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians .  there s no hope .  the future is bleak .  then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl ( john travolta ) and the alien race .  it s an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise .  considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen , it s difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably .  but it does .  the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits .  are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold , the psychlo never discovered fort knox ?  or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ?  or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ?  or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don t notice that their slaves are missing for days ?  travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he s worth and is almost entertaining .  almost .  the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person -- " man-animal " or not -- would ever utter .  some of the film _looks_ good , but it also looks so familiar .  a race of large hulking ape-like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin .  sound like something charlton heston might be in ?  the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from " dune " .  the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high-tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with .  it s too loud .  it s too oppressive .  it s too slow .  it s too long . . . far  too long .  and on it goes .  the list of the problems with " battlefield earth " is endless .  it s difficult to find anything in the film that does work .  oh yeah .  the color scheme is nice .  the real question is how this movie ever got made .  could it have something to do with the fact that l . ron hubbard was the founder of scientology ?  and that john travolta is a member of the church .  that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago .  but it doesn t give us a clue as to why first-time screenwriter corey mandell s atrocious script was used .  or why the high-profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film .  or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems .  the one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costner s " the postman " ( which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure ) be " the " big budget science fiction failure .   " battlefield earth " has the honor sewed up .  often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video .  that s not the case here .  you can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one .  don t hesitate .  strike now while the iron is cold .

negativeC,' hey , i ve got a great idea for a movie !  ok , here it is : we ll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so !  what s that ?  sounds too boring ?  ok , how about this then : we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours , but half of them are angry looks and half of them are " i m in pain ! "  looks !  what s that ?  that still doesn t sound funny to you ?  how about if we through in some " ewwwww ! "  looks ?  still not funny ?  if you answered " no , that doesn t sound funny " , then ( ding ding ding ! )  you re absolutely correct !  for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple ( played by tim allen and kirstie alley ) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant ( wayne knight , best know as newman on tv s " seinfeld " ) gets them in trouble for tax evasion .  what ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell .  what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs .   .   .  namely , talent !  backing up , the married couple is brad and caroline sexton ( allen and alley ) , a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else , but in reality are on the brink of divorce .  just as their marriage seems to be hanging from it s final thread , brad discovers that his accountant , bob lachman ( knight ) , has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton s names .  the irs catches on , but since everything points back to the sexton s and not lachman , there is nothing much to do .   .   .  except run away and join an amish community .  first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle-out-loud moments , and even some decent laughs here and * way * over there , but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you ll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn .  alley is absolutely unwatchable , and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade ( which , i inform you , was total b . s . ) .  allen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons , nor are they very convincing as an amish couple !  this entire movie is one bad ill-conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning !  the amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing .  it s such a trite , stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast ( noticing that they re all predominantly tv figures ) were probably the only ones they could get !  bryan spicer s directing doesn t help one bit , either .  in fact , listing spicer s filmography ( which includes the first " power rangers " movie and the big screen adaption of mchale s navy ) is more of an insult than a r ? sum ? !  now that i ve pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground , i will let you in on the best thing about it .  it bumped seven films up a notch on my " worst of " 1997 movie list .  that s right , thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the year s worst , six films are now not seemingly as bad , and a smile like yours , previously inhabiting the number ten spot , now doesn t have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list .  if you look at it in that respect , for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all ! '
negativeC,' even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material , as this subpar submarine comedy proves .  down periscope stars kelsey " frasier " grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer s ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy .  like any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who doesn t belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on .  then comes the transparent plotline .  first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard .  after the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who can t connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone .  finally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise .  and he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability .  first they re singing " louie louie " like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they re making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off .  the whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) .  it s all predictable without any original humor to redeem it .  the jokes are right out of " mchale s navy " and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past .  there s one scene where schneider looks through the ship s pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , " this expired in 1966 ! "  i yelled back at the screen , " so did these jokes . "  i watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it .  my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour , i started writing my will .  the blame can t really be placed on the stars , though .  kelsey grammer is good in this , he just doesn t have anything to work with .  his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had " welcome aboard " tatooed on his penis .  grammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about .  same for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she s so gorgeous .  as for schneider ( whose character is downright annoying ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although he s still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the " snl " ship .  my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy ( " okay , it s police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber . " ) and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster .  judging from the video box , most other movie critics agree with me .  the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel s jim ferguson .  i guess even jeff craig from " 60 second preview " ( who said tank girl " kicks butt ! "  without ever seeing it ) didn t like this . '
negativeC,' movies don t come much more ridiculously titled than " i still know what you did last summer , " but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous , the title sort of works as a warning .  more than a silly-sounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor , this horror sequel s moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot : what " you " did _last_ summer " you " actually did the summer _before_ last summer , and since " i " knew about it _this_ summer as well as _last_ summer , it s really illogical to say that " i " _still_ know what " you " did _last_ summer .  the filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter " i still know , " the longer " i still know what you did two summers ago " or the appropriate " stupid people getting hacked to bits . "  that last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart .  for example , if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago , would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet , even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress ?  probably not , but that s precisely what college student karla ( pop diva brandy ) does to best friend julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights .  julie , you ll recall , was one of the sole survivors at the end of 1997 s surprise hit " i know what you did last summer , " after a slasher with a grudge to bear - it s a _long_ story - began trying to pick off her , her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village .  in this installment , the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas , and julie , yet racked by guilt , decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind .  yeah , right .  their island paradise has room , of course , for one more in the form of the still-alive killer ( muse watson ) from the first film .  he sports the same gorton s fisherman get-up , a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity , but why he s still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves . . .  though i suppose his hook-hand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit .  in a sense , that s the movie s glaring flaw - everybody knows who the bad guy is , thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel .  the murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary , but trey callaway s derivative " i still know " screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims .  when julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed , giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all , what does he do ?  he twist-ties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays - you d think he d want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later .  even prequel " summer " lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neat-o shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh .  the innovative gallows humor that scribe ( and " scream " wunderkind ) kevin williamson injected into " i know "  s unfolding story is sorely missed , replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like " yo " ; you ll cheer - not shriek - when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest .  if " i know what you did last summer , " however effective , was just the kind of movie that those subversive " scream " flicks poked fun at , then the deadly " i still know what you did last summer " deserves a full-blown roasting on " mystery science theatre 3000 .

negativeC,' synopsis : a humorless police officer s life changes when he befriends a super-smart , super-adorable golden retriever named einstein and a cute , young blond scientist .  unfortunately , einstein shares a psychic link with a bigfoot-sized ape-creature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine , and this rogaine-nightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl .  meanwhile , a group of white , chain-smoking , gun-toting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie .  comments : watchers reborn , a cheaply made direct-to-video turkey , is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz s bestselling novel watchers .  technically , this should have been called watchers v , but it seems that this cycle of horror movies , much like many other sequel-crazy film series , has decided to drop the numbers from the titles .   ( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi . )  the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago .  this really isn t a good movie .  have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ?  well , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he s seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn .  they re awful .  these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an " action " movie called detonator starring scott baio .  scott baio !  what idiot dreamed this movie up ?  after surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn .   " maybe it won t be * that * bad " he may say to himself .   " perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading .  watchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago .  it stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy .  lou rawls is even in the mix ! "  unfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book .  the latter is really too bad .  koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer .  koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful .  people who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices .  it s definately not a koontz book if there isn t ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people s eyeballs .  watchers has all three devices , which may explain why it s arguably the most popular of koontz s books .  the idea behind koontz s novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting .  basically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target s position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat .  silly but kind of neat too .  i m sorry .  i don t mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie .  i suppose i just don t want to talk about the movie itself .  this turkey is really cheesy .  no one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it s difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero .  the cheese factor is only increased when he s involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she s-supposed-to-be whom he befriends .  mercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity .  to be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein .  you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts .  i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie .  and the creature !  yes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling .  this creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it s okay .  the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing .  oh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around .  cheesy gore .  that s another main element of watchers reborn .  it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film s campiness rather than its suspense .  ultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film s silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it s an 83 minute film , but it feels like four hours ) .  also , i hate to admit , i have survived far worse than this .  anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin : fear the rush will know what i mean .  finally , i couldn t help but think that watchers reborn would work well as " bot fodder " for the creative folks behind one of my all-time favorite shows , " mystery science theater 3000 . "  this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face .  rated r , watchers reborn contains dozens of blood-spattered bodies and unconvincing gore .  it also has violence , obviously .  i wouldn t recommend it for the little kids , but i m sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay .  instead of watching this film , however , i recommend reading koontz s book .  trust me , it ll be time much , much better spent .

negativeC,' you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the " odd couple ii " sneak preview .  they were as happy a group of men as i ve ever encountered .   " what a great movie , " exclaimed one gent at the urinal , " everything was so true ! "   " yeah , " laughed a man standing next to him , " i drive as slow as that one guy did .  my kids give me holy hell for it ! "   " and peeing is a big part of my day , just like with felix , " chuckled another fellow , as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared to rejoin his wife .  if you re over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit , " neil simon s the odd couple ii " may be just the film for you .  others will likely be less charitable .  while " the odd couple ii " is amiable enough , neil simon s shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped-together tv reunion show , suffering from wheezing situation comedy set-ups and jokes straight out of the borscht-belt .  simon , once the toast of broadway , has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson , missouri .  the contrived story , involving the marriage of their kids , provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison and felix unger , who haven t seen each other in 17 years .  the former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and , quite literally , run into one another at the airport .  they take off in a rental car for the ceremony in san molina , get lost and have a series of " wacky " adventures on the road .  jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob .  while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair , the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that they ve headlined three films together since 1993 : " grumpy old men , " " grumpier old men " and " out to sea . "  still , the two veteran actors are fun to watch .  matthau , whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes , has a field day as oscar , the crown prince of the curmudgeons .  lemmon , looking pastier than usual , is fine as the ever- annoying felix , who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of " phnah !  phnah ! "  despite their bickering , the characters have real affection for each other , providing a welcome respite from the non-stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together .  unfortunately , matthau and lemmon s charm isn t enough to compensate for simon s hack script , which wouldn t pass muster even on a upn sitcom .  one contrived situation follows another , lathered with enough stale one- liners to supply a dozen would-be comics on open-mike night at the local comedy club .  if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was , try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements .  burger king gets one , as does the el pollo loco taco joint , but budget rent-a- car really hits the jackpot .  between script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name , i couldn t keep count of all the plugs .  i did , however , keep track of some of the swearing .  i came up with four " god-damns , " three " shitheads " and two " fucks . "  the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience , but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them , howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word .  it s sad that a writer of neil simon s stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs , but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise .  one running gag involves oscar and felix s inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held .  at one point , the men actually spend 30 seconds just free-associating , riffing off variants of the word " san . "  the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing .  one of the oldest maxims of film-going is " beware of movies that use the author s name in the title . "   " neil simon s the odd couple ii " is no exception to the rule .  while the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon , it has no business playing in a movie theater .  of course , there s a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word i ve written , and would probably whip my " young-whippersnapper " ass to boot .  one thing s for sure , though .  they ll never catch me in a car chase .

negativeC,' the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don t count neil simon s biloxi blues ) .  year after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt .  bilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last .  i thought stripes would be different .  with ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army .  instead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army .  murray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him .  so he does , and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences , more mind-numbingly stale here than ever .  the characters are even less original , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette .  all the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette ) fall victim to the lame , rehashed material and are never really likeable , murray in particular .  he only gets a few decent lines in , although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters .  he was even better in caddyshack , for crying out loud .  as with a lot of the late 70 s / early 80 s comedies , stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it .  i m sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women , but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition " dear god ! "  every few seconds .  stripes isn t the playful kind of sex comedy , either .  most of the time it seems downright misogynistic , as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women s showers or murray lifts a female m . p .  onto the stove and , with an i-know-what-you-like look on his face , says he s going to give her the " aunt jemima treatment , " which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly .  you don t want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region .   " i m not enjoying this , " the woman protests .  my sentiments exactly . '
negativeC,'  " mercury rising " has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary .  that s right .  the major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better .  this central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic .  his name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it .  simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him .  the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of " mercury rising . "  i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon s character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost .  miko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he s touched , and has a hard time looking at other people .  it s a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn t playing like he s autistic .  unlike dustin hoffman s performance in " rain man " or leonardo dicaprio s in " what s eating gilbert grape , " we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting .  however , unlike " rain man " which used its character s autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , " mercury rising " could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid .  hell , he doesn t even have to be shy .  in fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis  arm .  willis  character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything .  he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon s house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide .  of course , we know that isn t the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents .  simon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked .  jeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon .  this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon s parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes .  late in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop .  of all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst .  i can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey s character is far too accommodating .  not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent .  the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point .  the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here " mercury rising " doesn t rise to the challenge .  the movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including " sea of love " ( 1989 ) and " malice " ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion .  there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were .  the grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it s more suspenseful that way .  taken as a whole , " mercury rising " is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor .  usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious .  this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts .  maybe the book was better , but the way it s handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore .

negativeC,' i have never been a " star trek " fan , and , to tell the truth , out of the five films in the series that i have seen ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 ) , i have disliked all of them .  i do , however , always go into one of these with an open mind , and the ninth film in the series , " star trek : insurrection , " is no exception .  dropping almost completely the hard-core sci-fi element of the previous one in the series , " first contact , " " insurrection , " tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people , known as the ba ku , as well as the fountain of youth .  at the start of the picture , the villagers go under attack by a second alien species , known as the son a , who want to push all of the ba ku out so that their own race will not die out .  also attacking the ba ku is data ( brent spiner ) , a robot from the star trek enterprise .  after returning to jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the gang on their space ship , no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force .  so several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba ku , where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants , a sultry , kind alien woman ( donna murphy ) , who is over six-hundred-years-old , but looks to only be in her thirties .   " star trek : insurrection , " is a completely unoriginal and cheap-looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996 s " first contact , " which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different .  in , " insurrection , " however , it plays like a low-rent episode of the television show , due to the small-scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one-liners rather than excitement .  the film was filled with nearly non-stop comedy , and worse yet , most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff .  meanwhile , when there were action sequences , they were not at all interesting or inventive , relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very , very slowly .  this plot device , which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays , is getting old fast .  are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax ?  another element of , " star trek , " films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest , but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later .  although donna murphy , who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here , is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103-minute running time , alfre woodard was far superior in , " first contact . "  she should have returned for this one , but i don t blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie s disappointing and often lifeless screenplay , by michael piller .   " star trek : insurrection , " is perhaps the weakest film in the " star trek , " series , although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst , " star trek v : the final frontier . "   " insurrection , " is the type of " safe " sequel that will bewilder non-fans , since it is so low-tech compared to most of today s blockbuster action films ( although most of these are honestly not very good , either ) , and should disappoint the loyal trekkies , since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts .  on second thought , they probably should have completely thrown the script out .  that way , they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness . '
negativeC,' while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks .  and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year .  the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it s a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you ve seen the animated series on hbo you ll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he s been sent to hell .  todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else .  not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while .  every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student .  the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life .  al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him .  the next element in the film is the part when things go awry .  and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al .  as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene .  inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away .  hence , jason s mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world " is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil s army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again .  so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol  partner terry forms a relationship with his wife .  time passes .  and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . .  this character is merely a poor man s obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla .  now the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil  vs evil .  and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly .  john leguizamo s deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film s relief point .  all this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners .  and then there s martin sheen .  whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years .  his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent .  as the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot .  this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street .  i d never thought i d be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen s career is in better shape .  spawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable .  for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better .  it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie .  continually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made .  perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry .  the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible .  the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting .  it is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton s batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act .  but bruce wayne had human elements to him .  he was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human .  the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he s fatigued about being normal .  and as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary .  none of this is present in spawn .  the fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner s .  as an example of this film s vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic .  admittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that s when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum .  it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature .  besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn .  movies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to .  and kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one .  children are not muppets .  and spawn unapologetically targets children . '
negativeC,' it s not a bad thing to update old stories .  it s done all the time in the oral tradition .  the difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed , it s that it s dry .  the new cinderella , danielle ( drew barrymore ) is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come .  she s a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france .  when her father dies , she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla ( anjelica huston ) .  she works by day , but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night .  although the story is updated , you know the plot .  danielle meets prince henry ( dougray scott ) , goes to a ball disguised , is later found out and they live happily ever after .  the movie is often like watching a filmed play .  theater in real life is engrossing .  theater on the screen is usually lifeless .  there doesn t seem to be much going on .  the camera can be a star of films .  here it s a co-conspirator .  danielle s convictions are compromised .  a socialist and a feminist , she pretends to be royalty to get her man .  a kind woman , her last act in the movie is one of revenge .  the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish .  the fairy godmother stand-in , leonardo da vinci ( patrick godfrey ) is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle .  huston is enjoyable in her over-the-top wickedness .  in all fairness , my companion loved the film .  maybe it s one of those " chick flicks " that men don t like .  it is certainly a date film .  nearly the entire audience was couples .  oh well , maybe it s good for something . '
negativeC,' i suppose it s unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it s 1991 release .  michael lehmann s action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time  , or close thereof .  the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who s just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way ,   he explains , `i never saw et  ) .  greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes .  these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences .  it appears as if director lehmann didn t know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line .  if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn t get goofier , you ll soon be eating your words .  but , i m inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it s box office numbers suggest .  it s fast-paced and entertaining , if you ve got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor .  for the first portion of this review , i m going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk .  wish me luck .  first and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport .  while i m not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke .  he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions .  another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character .  they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there .  it s unfortunate that mcdowell s one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis .  but now i m rambling on again about the negative things , aren t i ?  enough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience .  it s stupid , pointless and repetitive .  i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn t have the potential to please anyone .  action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited .  and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks .  don t get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs .  it s too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced .  the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed .  it s understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i m not entirely sure .  coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie .  especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film .  things get more bizarre when we re introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat .  if that s not enough for you , there s richard e . grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover .  their crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here .  wait , maybe the only big laughs . . .  i m not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk .  i can t even begin to start about the film s absurd plot ; but let s not get into that .  i suppose there s some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate .  but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it s going from minute one , and from there it s 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck . '
negativeC,' if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell s infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era s heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat .  so when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) .  my , how easily does the worm turn .  hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics .  at the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers s last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included .  and with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . .  boring .  although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_ s lifelessness .  _54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender .  these characters are about as generic as those descriptions .  in focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat .  with the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers  but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club s famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow s feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she s a peripheral character at best ) .  as such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ .  what is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ?  even whit stillman s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene .  dancing isn t the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher s fault .  from what i ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54 s legend .  but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film .  aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored .  shane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold .  this tacked-on " romance " would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience .  they fail on both counts .  ultimately , _54_ s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n .  as in , there isn t any to be had for the audience .  too much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place .  anyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively .  when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film s conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) .  strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying .  there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them .  they re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 .  these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there s still a great disco movie to be made .  the problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course .

negativeC,' a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted , and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city .  the lawyer , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is not offered a job yet , he is asked to simply pick a jury .  he accepts .  the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm .  making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money , but a gorgeous apartment .  he convinces his wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) to make the move to new york .  the first case given to him is a big test ; a " winless " case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement .  the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal .  his new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life .  kevin s next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law .  although kevin s career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well .  mary ann is starting to have numerous problems .  she is experiencing severe depression over kevin s long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured .  kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife .  he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife .  not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm .  mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home .  kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father .  he also starts to lose control of his case .  kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man .  that man is his boss , mr . milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself .  kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store .  but how do you defeat the devil ?  why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ?  do filmmakers really believe that " normal " courtroom drama doesn t fit the bill and they have to juice them up ?  the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which wouldn t have been too bad if it weren t keanu reeves trying to pull it off .  i give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short .  charlize theron defines the term " over-the-top " in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in " 2 days in the valley " .  the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ?  maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him .  it s pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom .  please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest .  in 1986 i remember watching a movie called " wisdom " with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do .  what i like to call " guess what , it was all a dream " scenario .  in " wisdom " the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters " wake up " from an apparent and say " gosh , i m glad that didn t really happen ! " .  i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with .  well , the same thing happens in " the devils advocate " , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn t happen .  i know it s a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that .  of course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one .  as i recall , " wisdom " was a decent film .   " the devil s advocate " is not .  the devils advocate  directed by taylor hackford john milton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . al pacino kevin lomax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . keanu  reeves mary ann lomax . . . . . . . . . . . charlize  theron mrs . lomax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . judith  ivey eddie barzoon . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . jeffrey jones christabella . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . connie  nielson  written by randy turgeon , march 18 , 1998 .

negativeC,' the spy game is up .  you can thank charlie s angels -- the movie -- for that .  when did banality and pandering become okay ?  just steal from hong kong , the matrix , and a kitschy tv show from the mid-1970s and that s a movie ?  charlie s angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film i ve seen in ages .  charlie s angels is dumb .  just plain dumb .  as we all know , three of the hottest females on the planet -- drew barrymore , cameron diaz , and lucy liu -- are three super-agents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie .  they all drive fast cars , look oh-so-fabulous even in the morning , and don t seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men , having buildings explode ten feet in front of them , or flying through the air in matrix slow-motion .  and while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage-busting wetsuits , cleavage-busting waitress uniforms , and cleavage-busting wet t-shirts , they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying , drunk sorority girls , the kind who hit on everybody at a party .  the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer -- the great sam rockwell -- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company .  of course , the rival wants control of his new personal identification system , which involves such latter-day buzzwords as gps , cellular tracking , and even mainframe .  the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels -- like battling each of them in many round-robin matrix rip-off ( again ) fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to sliced-off locks of the angels  hair .  the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley , serving as charlie s manservant , or , more to the point , the angels  pimp .  the rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc , enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables , carbon-copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft , and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke s long-lost brother .  charlie s angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight .  nothing is difficult , plausible , or believable in any of the angels  actions .  it feels like the matrix , mission : impossible 2 , and cleopatra jones and the casino of gold all rolled into one .  diaz is a knucklehead .  barrymore is the " dangerous one , " mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role .  liu is just . . .  lucy liu , looking good in a skin-tight black leather suit .  the list of movies from which charlie s angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing .  the writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon , lethal weapon ii , all of jackie chan s movies , the great escape , saturday night fever , revenge of the nerds , payback , darkman , dr . no , the matrix ( as mentioned ) , and even tv s friends .  it s a shame , too , because one of the many screenwriters , john august , was at the helm of last year s favorite , go .  then again , what can you expect from a director known solely as " mcg . "  there is no camp value in the film , no interesting main characters , no invigorating action scenes , no reason at all to waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of a few supporting players .  note to hollywood : next time , let s leave the tv shows on the tv .

negativeC,' i have always been a fan of director neil jordan , from his early work , such as 1984 s " the company of wolves , " to 1992 s " the crying game , " and 1994 s " interview with a vampire . "  his latest film , " the butcher boy , " is a return to his roots in ireland , but unfortunately , it is not a successful homecoming .  told through the eyes of a 12-year-old irish boy , francis ( newcomer eomann owens ) , this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life .  his father ( stephen rea ) is an indifferent alcoholic , his mother ( fiona shaw ) is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals , and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore .  francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say , but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty , and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic , even capable of brutal murder .  the premise of , " the butcher boy , " is one that could have very well been turned into a thought-provoking , disturbing motion picture , but somehow nothing works .  francis is in almost every scene , but we learn very little about him , as if the film was distancing itself away from him when , i suspect , we were actually supposed to sympathize with him .  this is definately not young owens fault , however , because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance , and is able to also seem menacing as well .  the fact that we don t get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay .  the supporting characters are no help , though .  rea is wasted , and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son , or to anyone else for that matter .  he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout .  shaw has a little bit more to work with , since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair , but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her .  and singer sinead o connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice .  the pacing is all off in , " the butcher boy . "  although the story could have been dynamite , it moves at a deadeningly slow rate , and i found my mind wandering every once in a while .  it is also very episodic , because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs .  at one point , francis is sent away to a juvenile prison , and an odd , possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself , but nothing comes of it .  i d rather think of , " the butcher boy , " as a brief diversion for director jordan , rather than a total misfire .  he has already proven to be a strong director , but he lucked out with this latest film .  what could have been a courageous , unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy , only manages to be an ineffective , uninvolivng bore . '
negativeC,' as you should know , this summer has been less than memorable .  with a total of 4 decent films , it s not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing .  with that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on " the 13th warrior " will be .  the film is based on the michael crichton " eaters of the dead " , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king .  after tarveling for many months , he comes across a gang of norsemen , who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog .  so , they start picking men , and are left without 1 , thus ahmed is choosen .  so far it sounds interesting right ?  not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes .  after that , they basically run around killing .  that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film , because once your story is introduced , you have the rest of the film to start developing it .  obviously that s not the case here .  even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure , you will be disappointed .  since all the action takes place in fog , it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances , and to poor camera work .  can t the camera men sit still ?  i d like to actually watch a film in focus , but again , they failed to deliver that as well .  the film moves on and on until the point , where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you re eating .  with corny dialogue , that the characters laugh at for some odd reason , a script that goes nowhere , dull action sequences , a predictable ending , and worst of all weak characters , there s basically nothing to like here , except for maybe the set designs .  that s the only thing that honestly caught my interest .  when i heard that john mctiernan , the director , wanted his name kept out of the project , that made me wonder why ?  well now i know .  crichton s greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product , which led to a big arguement .  what s there to argue about anyway ?  the film couldn t be saved , no matter how much they spent or casted .  seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money , i wouldn t be surprised to see " the 13th warrior " become a hit .  please do me a favor and save your money at all costs , or else you will be lost in the fog , like the film itself .

negativeC,' if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don t look particularly good because i m doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it .  if that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : " shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don t have to . "  but i know that s bunk-you re going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say .  so i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie .  you know the feeling , when you re sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly .  sometimes i think that s why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever .  admit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies .  so do i .  so i saw " supernova . "  truth be told , " supernova " wasn t quite as bad as i thought it might be .  maybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn t started tinkering with the director s ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed .  maybe i m becoming a softy .  in any case , i didn t find " supernova " as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe .  but it s still bad .  the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel " nightingale . "  the crew includes captain a . j .  marley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) .  there are some attempts at " characterization , " but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) .  don t expect any more explanation , because you won t get it .  anyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent .  during the dimension jump ( i think that s what it s called , but don t hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board .  he calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with .  then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening .  have you seen " alien ? "  have you seen " event horizon " ( a lame movie in its own right ) ?  good .  then you ve seen " supernova . "  post-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either .  after all , no one s going to think for a second that troy won t turn out to be a villain .  but the bigger problem with " supernova " is that it can  t just stick to the simple plot it s afforded .  numerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it s a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped .  was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ?  did the ship s computer learn something about humanity ?  what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ?  and just what does the film s title signify , if anything ?  as far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn t developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements .  character relationships in this film also make very little sense .  for some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex .  we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes .  bassett and spader s characters start off hating each other .  fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they re engaging in some hanky-panky .  when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him .  every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut .  the most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits !  furthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits .  maybe that s why the film s title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster .  right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you re seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations .  the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby .  point b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing .  doesn t make sense .  since i didn t understand anything about these characters  motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ?  not a whit .  it s a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do .  they don t find it .  bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces .  sexual tension ?  more like constipation .  maybe they re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as " this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . "  not that we ever find out who that is , mind you .  the climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film s biggest forehead-slapper .  as troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected .  he  s awfully one-note , but it s not as if he s given any more notes to work with .  the rest of the cast does even less .  tunney stands around looking cute , then scared .  phillips broods .  cruz flirts with the computer .  then they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn t paying much attention by then .   " supernova " is pretty awful , but i m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got .  that s it .  if you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you ll probably hate it more than i will .  even the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven  t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn t going to save the film .  honestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ?  it usually results in a bad movie , and that s what " supernova " is . '
negativeC,' for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters , we recently went to a multiplex and saw undercover blues .  i would give it one half of a star for guts .  anyone in a movie this bad would have to have guts .  i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show .  the script was the worst part .  they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh .  they had lots of " great " sight gags like two people trying to go in a door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door .  turner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a game show .  the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left .  buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies .  tell them the show is great and smile a lot .   * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year .  a must see film .   * * * = excellent show .  look for it .   * * = average movie .  kind of enjoyable .   * = poor show .  don t waste your money .  0 = one of the worst films of this or any year .  totally unbearable .  review written on : september 29 , 1993  opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer s . '
negativeC,' the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits .  the rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that s exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is .  last year s speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year s species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory .  in some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer .  whatever uniqueness the original might ve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller .  julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion .  julie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) .  will and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics .  unfortunately , things aren t so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook .  it s another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending .  there s not much that s original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it s unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel .  for die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer .  the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing .  the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments .  much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point .  the whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem .  and , whereas the killer s identity might ve been a question in the first movie , it s almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically .  three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as " the killer . "  they re almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show .  and so , in the end , it s left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast .  god help us . '
negativeC,' i m a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson s work .  he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain .  with teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope .  what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here .  the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to .  but where are the thrills ?  the laughs ?  both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge .  and what a shame that is .  i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty .  kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office .  teaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign .  or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties .  i still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past .  the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren .  mrs . tingle is basically every student s worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils .  the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members .  i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way .  mirren s performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink .  in other words , it s a poor substitute for williamson s best work .  the plot is a big problem here .  material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director .  the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship .  but typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable .  later on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle s final exam .  leigh ann s best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it .  alas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning .  in the morning . . .  how convenient !  the three students head to mrs . tingle s house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann s name .  things get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle .  the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her .  of course , not everything goes entirely to plan .  besides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress .  there is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved .  the humor is completely inconsistent .  after many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze .  you continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace .  a moment like that never arises .  williamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders  vet tambor .  and the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely .  on the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher .  while everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable .  there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script .  mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching .  she is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can t save individual scenes that flounder in boredom .  if there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be `disappointing  .  basically , kevin williamson is his worst enemy here .  his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) .  we will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real . '
negativeC,' a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama .  it s jeroen krabb ?  s melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can t forget their bitter past .  the heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) .  her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst .  her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin .  he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can t locate them now due to all the changes in the city .  out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents  apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about .  the hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don t go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws .  chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn t talk .  the stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses .  to hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn t gone away there s a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator .  the film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman s book " the shovel and the loom , " goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality .  it starts off telling chaja s story of how she s a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can t be forgotten .  the effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters .  the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja s parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted .  the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith .  topol s reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense .  the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can t love : it starts out by showing how under chaja s loving care he s taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying  quack , quack  and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder .  but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy s sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done .  i felt i didn t just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story .  it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received .  in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past .  that seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about .  unless i was mistaken and the film s real aim was to make us cry over simcha .

negativeC,' the tagline for this film is : " some houses are just born bad " .  so i didn t expect too much from this .  but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre .  i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont .  i thought , mabe it will be fun ?  and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing .  but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? .  these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality .  here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation .  among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) .  actually , the doctor is researching the " primordial fear reaction " and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens .  but he gets unexpected help from the house itself .  it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights .  portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs .  a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth .  filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains .  but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen .  the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture .  is that exciting or what ?  the worst thing about it is that it didn t have to be bad .  it s based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house ,    by shirley jackson .  a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent .  it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience .   " the blair witch project " , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses .  and with a $70 mill .  budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror .  de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening .  he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush .  but why give him a more serious material ?  in the end " haunting " will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont s career as a director .  yet it wouldn t be fair to say that everything is bad .  the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky .  but this is where the good things end .  the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life .  it s nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn t engage .  at first you do not know what s going on .  is this part of the experiment ?  are these hallucinations ?  projections of the subconscience ?  paranoia ?  but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening .  the house is actually possessed .  it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window .  for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that s what i got ?  i believe hichock once said that " it s better to wait for a climax , than to see one " .  this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid .  they are impossible to take seriously .  any paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick s " the shining " , are absolutely baseless .   " shining " had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality .   " haunting " has only special effects and art direction to boast of .  and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film .  casting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse .  but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : " some films are just born stupid " .

negativeC,' porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie ( diane keaton ) for twenty-five years .  they and best friends mona ( goldie hawn ) and griffin ( garry shandling ) are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen , " town and country . "   " town and country " has a pedigree befitting it s title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry ( " the graduate " ) under the direction of peter chelsom ( " funny bones " ) .  after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates , the media has been prepped for beatty s next " ishtar . "  so , is it that bad ?  the answer is no .  but it s not very good either .  the major problem with " town and country " is that it s unstructured and random .  stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski ) .  next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin .  then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples  divorce lawyer ) .  ellie thinks she s overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family s mississippi manse .  the two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they d never become a couple to begin with .  back home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter s cheating on her .  porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he s gay .  the four friends , along with every woman porter s dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after .  although the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere .  the stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , " the virgin suicides " and tricia vessey , " kiss the girls " ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who s just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home .  after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out-of-nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son .  porter s romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled .  once the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm .  while beatty gets off a few tart observations , his character is mostly passive and bemused .  maybe we re supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn t initiate his own sex romps ?  keaton s ellie has a trusting nature that s a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character .  hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of " the out of towners " and " the first wives  club " while shandling s relegated to true second banana status .  kinski is bland and unmotivated .  andie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay s most bizarre subplot , which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting , billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic , wheelchair-bound , foul-mouthed mother .  heston and seldes are fun , as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party .  oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look , but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like " hear my song " and " funny bones . "  the script is this film s weakest link - it s telling that most of the ( few ) laughs come from old-fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit .  while " town and country " isn t exactly painful to sit through , it mostly just lays there .

negativeC,'  * * the following review contains spoilers * *   " please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie . "  -- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal  i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997 s batman and robin .  apparently , no one heard my words .  oh , how i wish you had heard them .  oh how i wish someone had stopped him . . .  because he s done it again .  the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale .  in fact , it was everything that 8mm is not .  in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . s . government .  keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves .  he returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it s important as well ) .  he s hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery .  after her husband s death she comes across a film in his private safe .  it appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera .  the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film .  so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film .  the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless .  welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman s lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) .  when you first see him , your first instinct is that he s behind the whole thing .  the choice of casting does the film in .  then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him .  the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet .  so your first instinct has now been confirmed .  then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous " since we re going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing " moments ) .  but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he s told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended .  huh ?  also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back .  so why did he give it up in the first place ? !  the lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? !  it s totally absurd . . .  and this is the screenwriter of seven ?  late in the film there s a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character s guns ends up underneath a car .  cage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table .  james gandolfini s character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of " suspense " .  you see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he s trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching .  go around to the other side of the car ! !  this goes on for minutes .  then , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car .  boy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves .  i think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he s seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn !  we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard .  other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that .  whenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it .  awful decision there joel .  another is cage s performance .  at this point he s capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad .  for 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he s interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) .  you re capable of much better mr . cage .  now as for you mr . schumacher . . .  i m starting to doubt if you re capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema .

negativeC,' there have been bad films in recent years :  mr .  magoo  was by far the worst ever made , the spectacularly bad  blue in the face  , the horrible  baby genuises  and now  i woke up early the day i died  .  it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie .  the film s acting ( if that s what you want to call it ) is well mediocre to me .  loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit , boy was i wrong .  after escaping from a mental institution  the thief  played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty .  he turns to burglary to survive , robs a loan back , kills the loan officer and runs with thousands .  a country-wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down .  he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later , comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere .  now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back , ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying .  a film which was based on a  long-lost  script by ed wood , i have only one question : no dialogue , only music and movement where exactly is the point ?  the film moves along at a rather slow pace , but does have one advantage : the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some .  it opens with a fun , innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that .  some of the low points are when  the thief  steals a woman s purse , and then she faints , sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom  the thief  kills to the music of  psycho  .  come on people get some new ideas already !  what s even worse is that the film has no plot at all .  well to a certain extent it does , but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we re bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen .   i woke up early the day i died  is a perfectly bad film .  it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie .  even with the huge cast talent , the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours . '
negativeC,' it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller .  some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may .  both those films were tense exercises in chills .  the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer .  but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively .  for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed .  each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot .  they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay .  the thrills all came from the plot .  ronin is like a film made by another man .  somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it .  we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik s screenplay is a bit obscure .  the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai .  when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west .  if you miss the opening , do not worry .  this film will explain again what a ronin is .  sam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin .  he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer .  he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france .  sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case .  dierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case .  sam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv s richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting ) .  also along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) .  the group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise .  their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team .  the story is not very easy to follow .  it is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom .  somehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case .  some very good actors are involved in this film .  one wonders what they saw in the script .  the characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers .  they know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed .  by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody .  maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create .  in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) .  as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy .  unfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it .  i rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  non-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin .  also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet .  this is the first blow of the 47 ronin . '
negativeC,' the main problem with martin lawrence s pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it doesn t seem to do anything except justify the woman s actions .  that is especially the case in lawrence s darnell wright .  he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long .  now don t think i condone this just because i m male .  my philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her .  darnell doesn t think like this .  he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them .  and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , " i m supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? "  after all , it is largely darnell s fault .  if he is lining up all these women , you d think he d have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does .  but he doesn t , so you get the sense that he s not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb .  you especially get this sense that he s dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her .   ( i d put my pants on in two seconds after that ! )  now , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it s hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage .  one final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with .  brandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell s " immature play " as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life .  but all of a sudden she says yes .  but when you listen to darnell s four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him !  lawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies .  look at this movie .  four writers , as a result it s too long ( two hours , when it could ve easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers didn t get along ) , all of which isn t necessary .  there are some bright spots , though .  whitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot .  and there are some funny parts ( like , for example , the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property ) , but they re just not enough to sustain the film . '
negativeC,' capsule : lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness .  potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring .  claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze , just to break the ice .  it s a perfect example of what my wife calls an s . f . e .  movie , where s . f . e .  means so f * * * ing earnest .  movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing .  claire is one strained speech after another , written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of a dmv clerk .  claire takes two women , claire and noel , both writers , and throws them together in the same cabin at a women-only writer s retreat .  claire wrights light comedy , while noel is a scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior .  obviously , the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about , and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie , that s all they do : talk .  the movie sets up its ( microscopic ) plot with beat-a-dead-horse-into-glue obviousness .  the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie , a self-professed lesbian , and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian , claire looks like she s been hit with a sockful of wet sand .  the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance , and claire looks out over the water reflectively .   ( ugh ! )  the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads .  all of this , of course , leads up to a scene of complete inevitability : claire and noel , in a scene that should have come an hour earlier , because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what s just happened .  we never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone , only how they felt about things that didn t even happen yet .  the problem with claire . . .  is not lesbianism as such , but the leaden way it s handled .  why is it that any " serious " ( a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful ) examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie that s unwatchably boring ?  the way this movie deals with lesbianism , we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids .  many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better -- more engaging , more creative , more intellectually and artistically interesting .  look at john sayles  lianna , or the interesting and little-seen desert bloom ; both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire .  what this movie needed was a good swift kick in the pants . '
negativeC,' the great actor james woods once said ( and i m paraphrasing ) , " if sex isn t messy , then you re not doing it right " .  a truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace " sex " with " your mad slasher film " ) .  for those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween .  urban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special .  for film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) " if you can t scare your audience , gross em  out , if you can t do that , make em  laugh " .  alas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention .  i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it .  it seems that audiences  tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt .  the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them .  unfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don t need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering .  if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla .  but forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced ) .  allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation .  these flicks aren t harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ?  sadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while .  and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three .  despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes .  as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend s setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer .  you see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface .  all those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected .  all the better for that elusive crazed killer .  coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task .  but alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it s way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity .  this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise .  it s the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques .  it s the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack .  i really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing .  yes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened , but wouldn t anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room .  i lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer .  apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers .  in scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man s rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his/her identity .  for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume .  though i must admit , urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film .  the film s killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they re coming from inside the house ) .  i won t spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2 : 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough .  sad to say , it doesn t include my favorite urban legend : a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil .  now that would be scary .  before i leave you , i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the second the lack of exploitation ) -- its characters , all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i ve ever spent an evening with .  only jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness .  the most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death , and i am not a cruel person ) .  ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining .  after all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can t stand getting slaughtered , which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can t stand not getting slaughtered .

negativeC,' the premise of turbulence is i m sure very familiar to us all .  we ve seen it before in passenger 57 , executive decision , and countless other flicks that are good in there own way .  you know , terrorists take over a plane , ask the police on the ground for what they what and so on .  turbulence starts out with a " convict " ray liotta being accused of a crime .  you think there is no way he could have done it , he s so open and kind .  he is taken in and is subsequently transported on a commerical plane to la .  this is already a problem .  there is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on .  anyway , it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting to get to la and spend christmas eve there .  well , convict one manages to stop the flight in its proverbial " tracks " and liotta , still as calm as ever , takes the other convict out .  he also has eyes for lauren holly , a flight attendent , and seems to grow closer to her .   " the plot stops here "  i didn t like this movie because it seemed to be a rip off of every other airplane movie i ve ever seen .  at one point , mr . liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining ( i m serious ! ) .  it was like they stole for every other movie down to a " t " .  the only reason i did not give this 0 stars is because it had some okay stunts .  don t even bother !

negativeC,' a movie laced with a good blend of action , comedy , and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet , but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way , creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product .  eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters , blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed , minus half of its original duo ( the late john belushi ) and nearly all of its original charm .  dan aykroyd reprises his role ( as well as his co-writing credit ) as elwood blues , the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self-proclaimed " mission from god " along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago .  as we begin , elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother s death in prison years ago .  completely on his own , elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood , only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away .  but elwood isn t completely without family .  it seems he has a half-brother of sorts - not a real brother mind you , just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo-father curtis ( cab calloway from the first film ) , who has also passed on .  despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) to do otherwise , elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band .  working as a police commander , cabel chamberlain ( joe morton ) , has an immediate disliking for elwood , who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother s affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet .  following elwood around is the lonely orphan buster ( j .  evan bonifant ) , who quickly learns to become a mini-elwood .  when bartender mighty mack mcteer ( john goodman ) joins the group , the blues brothers band is complete , and once again , the group travels the country , crashing cars , blowing things up , and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock .  meanwhile , cab s personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next-to-next-of-kin .  >from this point , the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between .  those hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story .  only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours .  for those people , it may be worth it , for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting , but when the story does intrude upon the festivities , the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes , musicians turned stiff actors , and the pointless 10-year- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing .  appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin , james brown , eric clapton , and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film , but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors .  blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really , really love this kind of music , you might kind of , sort of like this movie .  many , many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny , and if you don t have a passion for very deep blues/rock , you ll be bored out of your skull .  much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd s self-serving vanity project , but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this , none of the excitement is passed on to the audience .  and seeing three guys in three-piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long .  unfortunately , those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film .

negativeC,' if only austin powers : the spy who shagged me had been just half as original , zany , silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor , it would have easily been one of this summer s biggest pleasures .  if only .  in fact , the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original ; instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another , the filmmakers bombard us with used-up , tired jokes taken directly from the first one .  take the scene where austin powers ( again played by mike myers , but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously ) confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff .  after being pushed off the ravine , the bad guy is of course assumed dead .  but suddenly , we hear a pleading voice coming from down below ; he s only injured .  a similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery , but here i was insulted by it .  did the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a rip-off ?  apparently i overestimated the intelligence of the average movie-goer , considering that the film has pulled in over $200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone .  do i hear the sound of a franchise heading our way ?  having said that , though , i still cannot deny the film its merits .  the basic plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat ; dr . evil ( mike myers , in the second of his three roles ) , having constructed a time machine , goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch austin power s " mojo " ( don t you just love that word ? )  whilst he is cryogenically frozen .  when austin gets wind of this ( after a great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurley s vanessa kensington ) , he too travels back in time to re-claim his sexual drive , accompanied by the hot-to-trot felicity shagwell , played by heather graham .  this sounds stupid , i know , but in the movie it starts to make some kind of weird , off-the-wall sense , and it worked for me .  then there s mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a . . .  petite clone of myer s dr . evil , exactly 1/8 in size .  troyer s persona alone gains the film an extra half-star , contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble on his own mini-mr .  bigglesworth .  just try to ignore the fact that , at 2 8   , he would make dr . evil s height rise to just over 21 feet .  no matter .  however , there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour and a half ( the most notable being the now infamous tent scene ) , and that just isn t enough to warrant even a minor recommendation .  if there is in fact an " austin powers 3 " , they should just kill off secret agent powers and put the emphasis on dr . evil and mini-me .  unconventional , yes , but there s no denying that it d make for a better movie .

negativeC,' in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french-canadian co-production by max fischer .  the movie is set in paris where its hero , struggling american author david mirkine ( judd nelson , at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity ) suffers a terrible writers bloc .  he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle ( laurence treill ) .  unfortunately , she hangs out in jet set circles , which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous .  her connection with powerful david caravan ( pierce brosnan ) would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events .  although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller , drama would probably be more appropriate genre label .  pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers , and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments .  low budget also becomes painfully visible , and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film .  unfortunately , this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes , so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed .  instead , they would have to settle with pointless , slow scenes involving nelson , brosnan and laurence treill s attempts of serious acting .  all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone s precious time .

negativeC,' tv s buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in " simply irresistible . "  sarah michelle gellar , that never-ceasing crusader against never-ending evil every tuesday night on the wb network , here plays a down-on-her-luck chef suspected of dabbling in witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of magically scrumptious meals .  taste test results : some vampire slaying , though out of place , would have really livened this excruciating movie up .   " simply irresistible " is actually quite easy to deny , a disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on .  gellar s amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom ( sean patrick flannery of powder ) around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking , a secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the public s in her tiny tribeca eatery .  all this love and sorcery have a lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story , a tale that at times plays like an american spin on 1993 s mexican classic " like water for chocolate . "  several differences : one , " like water " didn t have a telekinetic crab , and two , " like water " was a good film .   " simply irresistible , " on the other hand , is about as challenging as an easy-bake oven .  amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness , from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger - though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish .  the intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals , but it s not like you re were going to miss much .  in fact , take away the few instances of salty language and this has made-for-disney channel written all over it .  but a majority of " simply irresistible "  s resistibility factor has less to do with the afore-mentioned overkill than the bland leads - tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that there s just no fun rooting for their inevitable " happily ever after . "  nor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense , so we re left with a ho-hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs ; it s not going to last long , people .  perhaps sensing this , the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley , dylan baker and patricia clarkson , but they don t go anywhere either .  in fact , nothing in " simply irresistible " goes anywhere save for gellar , and she doesn t go somewhere so much as you wish she d go _somewhere_ - like to a better movie .  already proving major talent with relatively few big- and small-screen roles , she s the sole reason this overcooked souffle isn t completely fit for the garbage disposal , looking smashing in her todd oldham-designed duds and investing much more in her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return .  it s certainly a dish best not served in it s current condition , but one can only guess that , without gellar , " simply irresistible " would be strictly unwatchable .

negativeC,' the 13th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canine s least appetizing residue .  the best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector .  my vote goes for the ending credits , where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you .  ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another man s wife .  he encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men .  fahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter .  the movie proves to be a new low point for banderas , who s acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying gay man in 1993 s philadelphia , than that of a warrior .  in the film s supposed pay off scene , he exclaims " i was wrong , these are not men ! " ,  a line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production .  unfortunately , banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chase s career look like oscar material .  the film , based on michael crichton s best selling novel , eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three years ago , and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony , but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow .  at the same time , the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions .  questions like " why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark ? " ,   " why does no one ever have blood cover both sides of their face , but rather just one side ? "  and finally , " will the manager give me a refund ? "  90 minutes into the 103 minute film , a man invites of the warriors " come with me , there is a woman who can help . "  unfortunately , there is nothing that could help this film .  the most appropriate ending would have been for the 13 men to join hands , form a chorus line , and break into a rendition of " springtime for hitler .

negativeC,' i ve heard it called " jaws with claws " and that s a fair summation of the plot , though that tag line does little to quantify quality .  director stephen hopkins ( blown away , predator 2 ) and screenwriter william goldman ( maverick , misery ) would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature , based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century .  they ve stacked the deck with two big stars ( val kilmer , michael douglas ) , a bigger production design , beautiful photography ( by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond ) , and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music .  the movie doesn t make a lick of sense , though , either as an epic or as your basic boo-fest .  in fact , some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think you ve stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000 : the movie .  how about the three guys with rifles , who trap a lion and then can t even hit the damned thing ?  or the ham-on-wry acting of michael douglas , who chews more scenery than the animals ever do ? ?  or , my favorite , lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops ? ! ?

" ,  and that can only go so far , no matter how hard the talent tries .  still , its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments .  the film s best moment ( and that s not saying much ) is a bit part by steven seagal , playing himself .  between executive decision and this , all of seagal s best roles have been cameos .  maybe he should consider a change of work : steven seagal , the character actor !  gheorghe muresan isn t a natural actor at all , and his thick cotton-mouthed accent certainly doesn t help .  in fact the only thing he adds to the role is his immense stature .  originally , the concept was designed several years ago for andre the giant .  andre also had a hefty accent , but he displayed a knack for comedy in the princess bride . . . something  muresan should have studied for some pointers .  why does billy crystal continually get caught in these pathetic comedies ?  he s proven that he can be much funnier than these formulaic films allow him to be , and yet , like a glutton for punishment , he keeps coming back .  that doesn t mean we have to .

negativeC,' alexander dumas  the three musketeers is one of the most often-adapted literary works , and for good reason : the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story .  perhaps the musketeer , a new film that " reimagines " the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix , is one adaptation too many .  it s just awful : spiritless , silly and unforgivably boring , transforming the timeless classic into a mish-mash of old-as-time clich ? s and incoherent , repetitive action sequences .  this time , d artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers , who can t even pronounce his character s name .  as a boy , he watched his father get killed by febre ( tim roth ) , a lackey of power-hungry cardinal richelieu .  he vowed to have vengeance .  after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman , he goes looking for his enemy .  on his quest , he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government .  the royal musketeers have lost their gusto , what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal s own guards .  only a few loyal swashbuckers remain , among them athos and portos ( who are only figureheads in this movie ) .  together with d artagnan , they fight to extricate the queen ( catherine deneuve ) from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant .  oh , and as an afterthought , d artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn ( mena suvari ) .  just thought i d mention that .  now , look : i don t know whose idea this was , but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue-lashing .  i have nothing against " modernizing " classic works of literature - at the very least , they can inspire viewers to actually read the book - but films as dull as this have no positive side effects .  director peter hyams , known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days , has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas  masterwork : the sense of excitement , cause , and camaraderie .  instead , we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous , uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing .  when the musketeers finally get to holler " all for one , and one for all , " i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt .  maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams s tone , which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader s digest condensed version of the story that he gives us .  it s as though anything that may have been construed as " fun " was purposely expunged from the production .  the joylessness of the proceedings , from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes , can be felt in every frame .  chambers can t act ; suvari , roth and deneuve can , but aren t given the chance .  and when push comes to shove , the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious , though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit .  some movies seem sloppy and careless , clearly made for a quick buck .  with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful .  the film is intricate , stylish and precise , hitting the wrong note every single time .

negativeC,' when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , " dangerous liaisons for kids ! "  it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears  1988 masterpiece .  imagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits .  and i was impressed .  in fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie .  it s kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs .  i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they re smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined .  cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do .  i also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be .  phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont .  wow .  isn t that a memorable name ?  i could just say it over and over again .  sebastian valmont .  it kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich .  sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can t have , no material object out of his reach .  he has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips .  and , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don t really exist .  the ones who do are irritating .  sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants .  since these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons .  kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn .  but it s too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the " paradigm of chastity and beauty . "  so , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) .  but -- dear god !  -- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove .  dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting .  cruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting .  kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her .  she is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons .  gellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive .  witherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn t the moral staple she s supposed to be : sure , she won t have sex until she s in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible .  but i can t forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness .  i have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions .  and there s one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone .  true , he is bad , but it doesn t help that he has no character to work with .  kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch .  the film fails in every other way , too .  first of all , nobody talks like this .  even the " intellectuals " i know don t bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering .  for a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there s no way we can join it .  cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene .  earlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie .  so , if we hate them , then what s the point of an extended sex scene ?  titillation , of course .  it can t even work under the pretense of " meaningful love scene , " because we hate the characters .  it s interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons .  kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears  film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) .  but kids don t act like this .  nobody acts like this .  in his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements .  the result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it s really deep and profound .  i ll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that doesn t change the fact that it s awful .

negativeC,' everyone knows that old rule ,  never work with children and animals .    in this latest horror flick mimic case , it s  never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals  instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience .  the film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches .  dr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the  judas  breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches .  the bug does it s job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone .   three years later  appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill .  the spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it s predator , and in this case . . . . it s  humans .  that should teach us for squishing all those bugs .  what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace .  perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the  predator  type movie it could easily have become .  if it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest .  the director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie .  there are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking .  if the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it s sadly babbling nonsense .  in fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them .  there is some action in this film , but it s directed in such an annoying way , it s just infuriating to watch .  the camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them .  the peformances are o . k , if slightly below average .  sorvino is o . k , although she s not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really .  the supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican  old timer  ever .  their reasonable good fun , however .  mimic , then , may fail with it s story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good .  like dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content .  it may be a bit too gloomy for it s own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well .  but looks aren t good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn t really belong .  a good opportunity , then , wasted .  a shame .  overall rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998 '
negativeC,' this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont s debut as a director , 1994 surprise hit speed .  but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead .  annie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again .  she s going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line .  they sacked him after he got sick .  now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship s safe for compensation .  that actually is the whole storyline .  speed 2 could do without dialogues .  the movie is all about images and remarkable sound .  i don t really know why this is called an action movie .  except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies .  first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie .  then desaster strikes .  sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around .  i looked for the " action " but couldn t find it .  most of the time she is part of the decoration .  the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door .  now we know that she can handle a chain saw .  we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds .  the bomb defusal of course goes wrong , but only the furniture is damaged , not our heroes who still are needed .  jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie , helping other passengers and frolicking in the water .  his initial sea-sickness is suddenly gone , because there are ship , crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger .  he does a pretty good job but i can t blame keanu reeves for declining this part .  then there s willem dafoe , the villain , who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein s monster .  he doesn t succeed , though .  an untidy appearance isn t enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential .  before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror .  i can t really recommend speed 2 . you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren t meant to be funny .  especially the showdown , when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat .  there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie .  in keeping with last year s desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death .  a really funny ( and meant to be funny ) scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision .  some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie .  had they looked out the window they wouldn t have missed the huge ship racing toward them .  those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects .  in an adequately equipped theater it s as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate .  but the ilm special effects can t save the movie .  for all the money they could have done better .

negativeC,' it s tough to be an aspiring superhero in champion city .  just ask mr . furious ( ben stiller ) , the blue raja ( hank azaria ) , and the shoveler ( william h . macy ) .  they re trying to break into the biz , but captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) , the city s hero numero uno , hogs all the action .  the good captain has his own problems .  because he s all but eliminated crime , amazing s endorsement deals are falling through .  the public craves a major slugfest , so amazing engineers the parole of his one-time arch enemy casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) .  frankenstein succeeds beyond expectations ; he captures capt . amazing before setting out on his scheme to destroy the city .  so , no one is left to save the day but our would-be superheroes , but their abilities are more " little league " than " justice league . "  the raja hurls forks at foes , the shoveler hits them with a shovel , and mr . furious just yells at people ( stiller is doing essentially the same character he played in a guest appearance on " friends " ) .  after a painful first strike , the guys hold auditions for teammates and add the bowler ( janeane garofalo ) , who carries her dead father s skull in her bowling ball ; invisible boy ( kel mitchell ) , who can only use his powers when no one is looking at him ; the spleen ( paul reubens ) , who blows devastating winds from his rear ; and the sphinx ( wes studi ) , a mysterious figure who will teach them to fight .   " mystery men " boasts one of the most talented and eclectic casts ever assembled .  in addition to those already mentioned , the credits include lena olin as frankenstein s evil shrink , comedian eddie izzard and the fugees  prakazrel michel as disco-themed thugs , singer tom waits as an inventor of superhero weapons , artie lange ( from " mad tv " ) as another thug , claire forlani ( from " meet joe black " ) as a waitress mr . furious is pursuing , louise lasser ( from " mary hartman , mary hartman " ) as the blue raja s mother , and actor/magician ricky jay as capt . amazing s manager .  the cast includes four oscar-nominated actors !  when i saw the list of players early last year , i figured the result would be a can t-miss comedy .  yet , i must report disappointment .  the script is probably the worst of 1999 .  nearly every joke misfires .  the stabs at comic books are too obvious to be funny .   ( for example , no one can recognize capt . amazing in his secret identity because he s wearing glasses . )  the fart jokes surrounding the spleen are surprisingly the only gags that work .  the cast tries hard , especially hank azaria , whose character adopts an effete british accent while in costume , but the script is just too lame to run .

negativeC,' 8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery .  nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe .  the movie happens to be an mythical  snuff movie  , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed .  all mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not .  welles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide .  although the  snuff  industry hasn t really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most .  the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away .  8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven t seen from another standard thriller .  the cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage .  while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . )  here , in 8mm , he s boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice .  and in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up .  only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent .  his performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he s just purely enjoyable to watch .  catherine keener is completely wasted as cage s wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves .  her character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year .  also fun is fargo s peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director .  as this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch .  unlike seven , 8mm isn t too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives .  lacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment .  but director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it s just not very disturbing .  schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the  dark belly  of the porn industry , it doesn t exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point .  also , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it s amazing to think it s the same film you re watching .  8mm is far from an success , a  snuffed  opportunity .  with a boring lead character ,  controversial  scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller .  ultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like .  and trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it .

negativeC,' the tagline for this film is : " some houses are just born bad " .  so i didn t expect too much from this .  but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre .  i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont .  i thought , mabe it will be fun ?  and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing .  but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? .  these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality .  here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation .  among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) .  actually , the doctor is researching the " primordial fear reaction " and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch !  what happens .  but he gets unexpected help from the house itself .  it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights .  portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs .  a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth .  filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains .  but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen .  the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture .  is that exciting or what ?  the worst thing about it is that it didn t have to be bad .  it s based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house ,    by shirley jackson .  a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent .  it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience .   " the blair witch project " , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses .  and with a $70 mill .  budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror .  de !  bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening .  he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush .  but why give him a more serious material ?  in the end " haunting " will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont s career as a director .  yet it wouldn t be fair to say that everything is bad .  the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky .  but this is where the good things end .  the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life .  it s nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn t engage .  at first you do not know what s going on .  is this part of the experiment ?  are these hallucinations ?  projections of the subconscience ?  paranoia ?  but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening .  the house is actually possessed .  it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window .  for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that s what i got ?  i believe hichock once said that " it s !  better to wait for a climax , than to see one " .  this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid .  they are impossible to take seriously .  any paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick s " the shining " , are absolutely baseless .   " shining " had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality .   " haunting " has only special effects and art direction to boast of .  and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film .  casting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse .  but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : " some films are just born stupid " .

negativeC,' the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as  anywhere but here .    there isn t one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest .  it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they couldn t figure it out for themselves .  if the film looks familiar , that is because " the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) " went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with .  alvin sargent s script was weak and annoyingly claustral .  wayne wang s ( " the joy luck club " ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn t convey .  pushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon ) forces her 14-year-old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross-country with her to beverly hills .  the daughter resents her twice divorced , unstable but exotic , schoolteacher mother , bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life .  the daqughter doesn t even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can t stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio .  so it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner .  adele s dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn t look that good , as she lands a job in a slum school , has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids , and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive .  daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there .  during one of many arguments with her free-spirited mom , they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed , she runs away , only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop ( michael milhoan ) , who offers her wise counsel .  with the cop s zen wisdom passed onto the daughter , she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla .  during their stay in beverly hills , she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer-- a t . s .  eliot ( corbin allred ) reader .  but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional .  when she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) , who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin , she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn t clearly shown why she wants to stay there , and for that matter , it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly .  the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams .  i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say , is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one , able to recognize mother s faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself .  mother has a series of setbacks , like being dumped by her dream-boat dentist ( bochner ) she met on the beach , and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part .  but mother learns that her daughter has grown-up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her .  she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do , is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do .  this of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom s heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way .  this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing .

" lara croft : tomb raider , " the big screen variant of said video game , which features a pumped-up angelina jolie ( the oscar ? winner for " girl , interrupted " no less ) in the title role is , however , none of these things .  it isn t fun , it isn t exciting , and the only challenge is seeing how long you can stay in your seat ( i suffered through to the bitter , bitter end ; the wife opted for barnes & noble at the 45-minute mark ) .  directed by simon west with the same subtlety he brought to " con air , " " tomb raider " is an empty-headed , big budget bore .  the story borrows unintelligently from that mother of all turkeys " hudson hawk " ( the same hokum about planetary alignments and sacred stones that , when brought together , well . . .  who the heck cares ? ) and it makes " super mario bros . " ( bob hoskins  ill-advised career move ) look like " rocco and his brothers " ( that classic of italian neo-realism ) .  i ll go out on a limb here and say i suspect there s actually more character development in the video game than the movie proper .  this is where the jolie defenders/video game nuts jump in and say this movie isn t about character development it s about kicking serious butt ( or bum , since ms . croft hails from england s green and pleasant ) .  with lips , breasts , and biceps all inflated to the max , lara croft is all about posturing , and jolie has a hard time simply standing still without trying to look tough .  ok , let s forget challenging .  shouldn t " tomb raider " be , at the very least , fun and exciting ?  shouldn t our butt-kicking heroine also encompass the sophistication of , say , james bond with the wit of indiana jones ?  there s no humor to be found anywhere in " tomb raider , " even though it tries hard from time to time .  even " the mummy returns " didn t take itself too seriously .  the villain here is noticeably lacking , the special effects are ridiculously overblown and unnecessarily complicated , and the script is non-existent .  to liven things up ( perhaps ) , jolie s live father jon voight puts in a few minutes as lara s dead father lord croft ; talk about a stretch .  one thing i hadn t expected from the film is that jolie affects a slightly better english accent than her pa ( although i suspect that thin-looking moustache he s forced to wear gets in the way some ) .  unsuccessful ? not entirely .  if anything , " lara croft : tomb raider " makes you want to check out the video game itself to figure out exactly what all the fuss was about .

negativeC,' walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox s anastasia .  but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios , the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about .  disney s recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and to a lesser extent , hercules .  with anastasia , fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window .  some may say - so what ?  it s just a kid s movie .  well . . .  if you have young kids , beware , as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse-rotting rasputin zombie , whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way .  consider yourselves warned .  nevertheless , the animation is quite stunning at times .  don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout , occasionally rivalling photographic quality .  and yet in other scenes , the hand-drawn material seems of the saturday-morning tv crowd , which leads me to wonder . . .  was this rushed to market to combat disney ?  the plot , as anyone who had read history before knows , concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916 .  not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened .  as for the plot --- go rent disney s candleshoe .  you ll see 60% of anastasia there .

negativeC,' here s something to chew on : what s the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ?  the obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that s the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature .  deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer .  in fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was .  the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore .  not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions .  we learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers .  i suppose deep rising s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn t do much for me .  on the surface , and that s about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) .  in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin .  the film is not humorous , tense , or exciting .  in fact , it s downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron s current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie .  is it really necessary to say anything about the plot ?  probably not , since it s easy to guess , but i ll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis .  the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship .  in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there s finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat s pilot , who s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o connor ) , the inept sidekick who s supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the " mastermind " ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation .  their goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally-acquired torpedoes .  the problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste .  aside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there s no one on board .  the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles .  the cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad s cinque ) .  williams , once a " can t miss " prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career .  famke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams .  given her limited acting abilities , it s likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes .  unfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of the picture .  meanwhile , kevin j . o connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard .  these days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer-generated special effects .  this is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action jungle book ) needs to learn .  the days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past .  now , movie-goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that it s impossible to tell where they end and where " reality " begins .  in deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing .  unfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn t so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) .  even once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won t be the last of its kind .  like the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush .  and that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying .

negativeC,' this is an adaptation of h . g . wells  acclaimed novel  the invisible man  .  the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue .  the director is paul verhoven .  that , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre .  the problem is to keep us there .  i can t imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time .  working on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself " god " , has discovered the secret to invisibility .  the first two faces are completed .  now , it is time for " the next logical step " -- human .  caine volunteers for this risky experiment .  but when he is made invisible , something goes wrong .  while his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower .  but that s not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania .  he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine .  soon every sense of decency is forgotten .  the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody .  though it s based on a novel called  the invisible man  , the title has been ironically changed to  hollow man  that sums up the film very nicely .  this is a very silly production .  laughable , actually .  apparently verhoven s imagination doesn t stretch too far .  for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls  locker room undetected .  it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie .  being invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society .  in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences .  the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about .  all that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat .  caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man .  but since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn t stop there .  he becomes a rapist .  and then , of course , a murderer .  you ll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place .  shue s talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent .  kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully .  his face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice .  there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing .  in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place .  being probably the best technical achievement since " jurassic park " , they are absolutely amazing .  we observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible .  we see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood .  there are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ?  what is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more .  pretty much like jan de bont ( " twister " , " haunting " ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary .  he was responsible for several good films ( " basic instinct " and " starship troopers ) " and some incredibly bad films ( " showgirls " , " total recall " ) , but he has never made anything that was great .  in a way " hollow man " fits perfectly in this collection .  it s not better or worse than verhoven s average film .  he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues .  and so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot s of dull action with blood and naked bodies .  he even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc . - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you ll be screaming " nooooo ! "  and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) .  and all we can ask is why ?  the answer is simple .  though hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money .  it has to be about telling stories , not marketing them .  it has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness .  to make us care , to make us think and feel .  verhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that .  it s all flesh and bones , but no soul .  a void where its imagination should be . '
negativeC,' eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights .  as the movie s writer , director , executive producer , and star , murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails .  but at the same time , he ll receive all of the credit if it succeeds .  should you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy s risky gamble ?  well , that depends on whom you trust more : me or eddie murphy .  here s what murphy thinks : " i think the audience is expecting a good time .  they gonna get sexy .  they gonna get funny .  they gonna get drama .  they gonna get all of that .  i think it s the best movie i ve done " ( paramount radio network ) .  here s what i think : harlem nights is charmless , unoriginal , disappointing , and almost without question , the worst film of the actor s career ( i haven t seen best defense ) .  and guess who s to blame ? !  the movie s problem is not murphy s direction : harlem nights is a fairly good looking film .  no , the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled .  murphy s awful script is the culprit .  let s count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting :   ( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture .  yes , he even outdoes his own work in raw .  practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word .  and after 15 minutes , it gets irritating .   ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast .  richard pryor , redd foxx , michael lerner , and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes .  each of them shines occasionally , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle .   ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men .  murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life , which is really neither here nor there .  but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 , 000 movie screens across the country , it s another matter altogether .  you re forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff .  for instance , murphy punches della reese in the stomach .  and he shoots jasmine guy in the head .  this is a mean-spirited movie , folks !  lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore , but only because she doesn t have any scenes with murphy .  thank god : he might have run her over with a bulldozer .   ( 4 ) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date .  the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film .  murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality .  sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair .   ( 5 ) the plot is a shameless rip-off of the sting .  if you re going to make another sting movie , you ve got to do something original .  murphy s tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem ( circa 1938 ) fails to add anything new to the formula .   ( 6 ) to get laughs , murphy makes fun of stuttering .  you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped .   ( 7 ) murphy s idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life .  for what ?  for shooting reese s little toe off !  needless to say , murphy shows little , if any , promise or imagination as a screenwriter .  in all fairness , however , a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie .  danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take .  aiello stands out in the large , ensemble cast : he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character ( a racist detective with mob ties ) .  aiello s zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice .  another bright spot is arsenio hall , who has a hilarious , show-stopping cameo as a cry-baby gangster ; hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy .  in fact , hall s ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie .  unfortunately , his character is completely irrelevant to the plot ; murphy should have given hall a much bigger role .  of course , i ve already mentioned that i didn t care for murphy s character , but i have to admit that i did love his neckties .  they are simply spectacular--almost worth the price of admission . '
negativeC,' because no one demanded it : david duchovny in a romantic comedy !  at last , both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources !  the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot , which could be fodder for a valentine s day episode of " the x-files . "  bob rueland ( david duchovny ) loses his wife elizabeth ( joely richardson ) in a car accident .  at the same time , grace briggs ( minnie driver ) is in the hospital , waiting for a heart transplant .  grace gets elizabeth s heart , and it leads her to bob .  it s the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people .  four writers are credited with contributing to the story .  that doesn t seem possible .  despite being a solid two hours long , " return to me " adds little to the " boy meets girl / boy loses girl " formula and , as a result , is terribly tedious and slow-moving .  duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks , and i kept wishing for a fast-forward button to move their scenes along .  since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before , i blame duchovny .  he s out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series ( and i ve always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on " the x-files " comes off more sibling-like than hot-and-bothered ) .  there s something about duchovny that makes me uneasy .  regardless of the role he s playing , he comes off as a weirdo .  the only redeeming quality of " return to me " is its hilarious supporting cast .  the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker , and they generate the only laughs in the movie .  carroll o connor is grace s grandfather marty o reilly .  when bob comes into marty s restaurant after hours , marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status .  when marty discovers that bob is a widower , he invites bob to join his poker game and introduces him with the declaration , " this is bob !  his wife is dead ! "  the poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news .  also funny : bonnie hunt as grace s best friend megan and james belushi as megan s husband joe .  married with children , megan and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance .  although it s rare to see him in a movie that premieres in a theater , belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill .  rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob s best friend and robert loggia as marty s brother-in-law angelo .  in only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast .  bottom line : if you are compelled to see this movie , watch it on video so you can fast-forward to scenes with carroll o connor and james belushi . '
negativeC,' i m not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream , but i m guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft .  seriously , this idea--a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends--is a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off .  the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue .  an example : " that [car crash] must ve been awful . . . for  everyone involved . "  you can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said , just no one figured out what .  i know in slasher movies there isn t supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself don t mind cardboard cutouts , but please don t let the cutouts be so damn bland .  one reason movies like scream , star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters .  aside from jared leto and joshua jackson ( who aren t on the screen long enough ) no one in urban legend makes the grade .  alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill , rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive ( not to mention as dumb as a post through 3/4 of the film ) and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot .  good thing brad dourif is here , but wait . . . he s only in the movie for five minutes _and_ he s just redoing his good-natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo s nest .  which brings me to another aspect of urban legend : it s unoriginality .  the film most blatantly ripped off is scream ( another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven s and williamson s great success ) .  urban legend tries to deconstruct modern-day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films , but it doesn t quite succeed .  it s best stab at self-reflexivity is poking fun at " that girl in the noxzeema ad " ( ie , rebecca gayheart ) we also have another killer-taunting-his-victim-on-the-phone routine in urban legend and quick , what movie is this exchange of dialogue from :  female protagonist : why ?  villain : why ?  why ? ! ?  congratulations to those of you who answered scream and/or urban legend .  like i said , this movie could ve been great .  if only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script .  still , at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer .

negativeC,' drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside - the one who s the awkward klutz or the spunky do-it-yourselfer ; the one who just doesn t fit in with the others .  she has perfected these characters in movies such as " the wedding singer " and , most notably , " ever after . "  now she s back , starring in what could be called a modern-day cinderella fable - " never been kissed . "  you know it s a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary .  trust me on this one , no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg ( and i don t mean steve ) invented the printing press .  the premise is simple .  barrymore s josie geller , at 25 the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun-times , is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what today s teens are feeling and doing .  josie ( she says she was named after the  70s cartoon character ) was a geek in high school , so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance .  this time , she thinks , she will get it right and be accepted by the in-crowd .  now , what kind of adult - with a good job and a successful career - would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was - and is - high school and adolescence .  these are among the many problems that plague " never been kissed . "  screenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get a handle of josie .  their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy , blubbering woman-child at the least provocation .  and the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high school s most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability .  ok , so " never been kissed " is not a sociological expose of today s high school scene .  however , certain rules should apply to film , and one of those is consistency of character .  among the movie s problems is the ill-conceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and , in the process , lose focus on her assignment .  any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say " get me rewrite . "  to be fair , barrymore is very appealing , but she is given very little to work with .  she tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character , but the script continually undermines her .  barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk , talk and act like a cool , hip high schooler .  otherwise , she is left foundering on a cliched sea of teen-age stereotypes and situations .   " never been kissed " is entertaining and funny in fits and starts .  it lacks consistency and a firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish .  the movie s main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys , the outsider who befriends new student josie .  josie sees a lot of her former self in aldys , yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls .  real mature .  and that is the main deficiency with " never been kissed . "  it s illogical , unrealistic , uneven and undemanding .  it has some warm and humorous spots , but not enough to overcome its many obstacles . '
negativeC,'  " come on , silent bob !  we re going to hollywood . "  starring jason mewes , kevin smith , will ferrell , shannon elizabeth , seann william scott , chris rock , jason lee , ben affleck .  directed by kevin smith .  rated r .  jay and silent bob strike back is a dumb movie disguised in a smarmy interior .  kevin smith , coming off the wonderful , challenging dogma , fills it with sub-road trip gross-out jokes and expects us to buy it because he s just oh-so-ironic .  but when a movie is so self-aware it becomes about nothing but itself , we can hardly be expected to pay for admission .  jay and silent bob , two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot , have appeared in almost all of smith s movies but , if i m not mistaken , have not starred in one until now .  they find out that there is a movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made in hollywood .  this presents two problems : a ) they haven t received a penny in royalties and b ) nerds on the internet ( " what s the internet ? " )  are talking trash about them .  what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made ?  on the way -- they re hitchhiking , because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus ?  -- they run into a group of hotties who pretend to be with an animal-rights group , but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie s angels-style outfits .  of course , they set jay and silent bob up to look like the thieves , so that there is a massive manhunt going on during the second half of the film .  will ferrell , who again proves himself incapable of doing anything but sketch comedy , shows up as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey .  the movie will probably please only smith s die-hard , undiscerning fans ; everyone else will be critical of this mind-bogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past .  any appeal the movie has will come from the " in " jokes , most of which i think i understood , but the movie is " in " to the point of absurdity .  there needs to be something holding it together other than its own smugness .  once jay and silent bob get to hollywood , the movie abruptly switches gears from gross-out comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire .  countless " hot " movie stars and personalities make an appearance , from smith veterans matt damon and ben affleck to wes craven , but jay and silent bob strike back resorts to such low-brow gags as another scream sequel with a monkey as the killer .  get it ?  they re so desperate for another movie , they ran out of ideas and used a monkey !  a monkey !  as often happens with writers who are working below what they are actually capable of , most of the really good lines are throwaways , while the big , painstaking gags mostly fall flat .  one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by : when asked to comment on the clitoris ( don t ask ) , jay responds : " the female clitoris ? "  kevin smith is a talented writer ( though i agree that his films would be better off if he d let a real director take the helm ) , and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make a more facetious film .  unfortunately , it s also shapeless , pointless and largely unfunny .  smith s " verbal trampoline , " as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue , takes a back seat to his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker .  this was supposed to be the movie that didn t offend anyone , but it s offensive because it s terrible . '
negativeC,' let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series .  it is so full of self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof .  an omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence , a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it s difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title .  a song with woefully terrible lyrics follows , and the rest of the movie is even worse .  the plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin , francisco scaramanga ( christopher lee , putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore s 007 .  there is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95% efficiency .  it s as much of a mess as it sounds .  bond is " helped " in his task by mary goodnight ( ekland ) , whose character couldn t possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo .  during the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk , blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever .  maud adams ( later to star in octopussy ) is a much more stronger and useful character , but she hardly features in the movie .  scaramanga s lackey is a dwarf called nik-nak , who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series , serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures .  worse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie .  there is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists -- another misguided attempt at humour ) .  the solitary car chase might have been a highlight , but the " action " is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff ( j . w .  pepper , played by clifton james of live and let die " fame " ) yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window .  he is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie .  even his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history , a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge -- could have been , except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print .  on top of that debacle , the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga s " funhouse " .  the only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series ( the infinitely superior " the spy who loved me " ) a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive .

negativeC,' since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993 s steven spielberg drama " schindler s list " and directed 1993 s intelligent " searching for bobby fischer , " his new film , " a civil action , " should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career .  what doesn t make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective .  the film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama .  based on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , " a civil action " is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children s death from leukemia due to unknown causes .  jan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families  homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city s drinking water .  suddenly , after hearing about the families  heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out .  also figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods  corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case .  coming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , " a civil action " is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience .  perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning .  watching the film , i couldn t help but notice its similarities with 1997 s far , far superior film " the sweet hereafter , " which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children .  in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home .  not only was the plotting similar to " a civil action , " but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes .  considering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful " a sweet hereafter " was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm s character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl .  in " a civil action , " however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness .  we do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters .  through its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta s lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn t appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job .  every scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for .  you ve got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents  plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what " a civil action " does .  to be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked .  aside from one flashback to when a man s young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering .  i could say the performances were good , but who s fooling who ?  since every character is one-dimensionally written , no one s acting abilities are challenged in any way .  travolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that s about all he does .  duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets .  and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture s final scene , as a judge ?  she appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ?  finally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ?  abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , " a civil action " seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with .

negativeC,' synopsis : al simmons , top-notch assasin with a guilty conscience , dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell .  making a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell s army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape .  sullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn s attention .  comments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the " spider-man " titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn .  mcfarlane s " spawn " immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s .  mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max .  the early " spawn " issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane s genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing .  with the popularity of " spawn " and the success of the current warner bros .  s batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn .  in the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series .  this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark .  what happened ?  why is spawn so bad ?  todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo .  i don t think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film .  i place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology .  these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc . spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics .  hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons .  a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don t get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren t engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath ) .  spawn s translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level .  mcfarlane s spawn was a tortured hero .  a mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda .  having died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda .  simmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married .  despite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn t help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld .  spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so .  when the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching .  the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters .  spawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman ) .  john leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second .  i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator .  the film , however , spends so much time on the violator s offensive antics that they grate on the nerves .  apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator s lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave .  leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film .  michael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on .  more time needed to be spent on white s character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings .  a special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn .  easily the hammiest performance in the movie , it s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now .  sheen s excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film .  many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down .  mtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them .  flames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting .  cogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film .  he goofily tells the audience , at one point , that " how much of [spawn s] humanity is left remains to be seen , " as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another .  the music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue .  loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes .  to be fair , however , marilyn manson s " long hard road out of hell " effectively compliments spawn s return to earth , while filter and the crystal method s " ( can t you ) trip like i do " proves a surprisingly fitting theme song .  for as good a comic book as it is , " spawn " did not spawn a good movie .  spawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development .  it receives two stars for its technically well-done special effects .  many other films , though , have equal , if not superior , special effects and are much better .  rated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r-rated movies and probably wouldn t be appropriate for the very young .

negativeC,' i can t recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota .  for forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt .  then , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another .  feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face .  feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him .  red s punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie s dreams .  enter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam s estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie s eye and have sex with her in the bathroom .  united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn t ready to let them go without a fight .  freddie , meanwhile , isn t ready to let sam s money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations .  there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam s intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father .  it does a great job of setting up jjaks  unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves  wounded look is just right for jjaks .  the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin .  most important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements  " i will dare " on the car radio .  you would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota .  unfortunately , you would be dead wrong .  i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn t expect what i got .  what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality .  suddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable .  the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations .  vincent d onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood .  there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme s something wild and neil jordan s the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn t try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment .  i don t want to dismiss baigelman s successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper .  it _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can t make his two halves into a whole .  feeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there s not much funny about that .

negativeC,' wolfgang petersen s latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple .  it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it s going to hurt ? quite a bit .  ok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here s my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn t really much of a story to tell .  basically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of " the storm of the century . "  how much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ?  not nearly enough .  so he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous .  audiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel .  the last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters .  i have yet to read sebastian junger s the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale .  based on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak .  using a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality .  right away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c . reilly ) , the comic relief who s always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) .  so many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer .  it is not the all-star cast s fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal .  allen payne s character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he s never given any lines !  are we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ?  fichtner s character is terribly underdeveloped - we don t know what he s doing there , where he s from , or who he s supposed to be .  the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene " you know what would look good on you ?  me ! "  ooooh real creative ) .  as the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human .  only when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk .  the computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real .  i can only imagine if this was an imax film , this city kid would surely never go in the water again .  this is loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film .  the perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment .  the maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so .  i guess i ll stick to that other survival spectacle ? you know the one on cbs ?

negativeC,' synopsis : valerie , a high school junior who doesn t look a day under 22 , writes bad poetry , complains about how much she hates school , fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women , chooses him as a pen pal , and plays hooky to see him in court .  after a jailbreak , the killer puts on big sunglasses , wears a half-buttoned jacket , and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie .  comments : " alan smithee " directed fatal charm , which should have been more appropriately titled " fatal bore " or " fatal crap " .  if you find out that a film you re about to see is directed by " alan smithee , " then you should seriously , seriously , seriously consider watching something , anything , else .   " alan smithee " is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad .  frankly , i d be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the " alan smithee " moniker for this film .  where to begin with this painfully poor thriller ?  let s start with the acting .  it s pretty bad .  amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don t ) , even though her performance isn t exactly stellar material .  she s also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete .  her scenes with valerie s mother , played by mary frann , are a joke .  the two look as though they re a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn t understand .  christopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm .  trying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket .  if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn t cut it here .  early on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom .  outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film .  they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever .  fatal charm s storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills .  the script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with .  this suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault .  even for the idiots who didn t consider the movie s title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up .  so , the audience must wait ( if they haven t already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale .  the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an " erotic thriller " .  a thriller it isn t , and neither is it particularly erotic .  i can t imagine , if someone were in the mood for something " erotic , " that he d be happy after watching this fluff .  a few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see , they re supposed to be valerie s fantasies -- how creative ) .  on a personal note , i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through .  it s no wonder why she hated high school so much .  as an instructor of english myself , i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature , a teacher would stoop to reading a student s bad poetry ( of course , it s valerie s ) about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem s inspiration .  i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students .  fatal charm won t charm anyone , unless there s someone that s charmed by boring , lifeless , insipid , suspenseless thrillers .  if you happen upon this turkey , just keep moving on .

negativeC,' a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel .  well , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller .  anyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus  known as man .  the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it .  no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable .  the story is full of very shallow characters that don t do much other than subsist .  the captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60 s ) .  to add to this we re shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks .  some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less .  none of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control .  this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable .  all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects .  the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves .  it looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish .  also on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ?  if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ?  regardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it .  as to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about .  the actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles .  having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe .  watching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely .  the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening .  so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won t be too disappointed .  as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens , it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect .  this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv .

negativeC,' this movie is based off the wildly popular video-game series of the same name .  before this film , the game had a few spin-off cartoons- which were ok .  but the idea of doing a movie is insane .  it should have been animated , if it should have been done at all .  instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast .  yet it still fails .  the plot is completely different from the game s plot- i m not complaining about that .  the story involves the mario bros . having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company .  eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis , which happens to be enviromentally un-safe .  so , due to luigi s ( john leguizamo ) girlfriend - princess daisy - they go and investigate .  they get transported to a blade runner-esque world lead by king koopa ( dennis hopper ) .  somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega-city jumbles in .  the plot is fine- better than the movie deserves .  the acting is ok .  this seems to be more of a visual film .  the special effects are good , especially on the robotic yoshi .  however the film drags and is no fun .  and it leaves itself open to a sequel , which probably won t ever be made .  this movie begins sort of promising , but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth .  so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper , then watch super mario bros . :  the movie .  you could do worse .  but you could definitely do better . . .   .  street fighter : the movie ( 1995 ) starring : raul julia and jean claude van-damme  this movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called street fighter 2 . it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot .  it is more like a " movie " than it should be .  yes , it s watchable .  raul julia does a good job , considering this was his final film .  while the game had non-stop fighting sequences , this movie is a hodge-podge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time .  does it work ?  sort of . . .  the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m . bison ( raul julia ) .  guile ( jean claude van-damme ) takes his troops to attack bison s main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over .  in a short amount of time , the movie introduces several characters well .  it catches your attention .  but it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like " there s chun li ! ! "  or " look at that fire-ball ryu did at vega " .  it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets , but goes no further .  this movie needed more action in the first place .  the action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting .  if you like light-hearted action flicks , or if you liked the game , watch this one .  it is even worth watching if you want to see raul julia s last performance , or if you can t get enough of van damme .  other than that , you could find better action flicks .   .

negativeC,' studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it s a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn t be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film .  are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ?   " 54 " belongs in the elite group of films known as " the big disappointments " : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished .  i was heavily awaiting " 54 , " not the least because i ve become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that s been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this " edgy " film .  perhaps more importantly , " 54 " is part of the blossoming subgenre , " the 70s nostalgia film , " which has been picking up mighty steam , what with " boogie nights " and " the last days of disco " coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from " boogie nights , " and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from " the last days of disco , " not to mention several others .   " 54 " deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that s all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it .  this is a definite plus .  here s a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening .  the story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let s look at how it all affected the people .  but this film doesn t let that happen .  it gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o shea ( ryan phillippe , from " i know what you did last summer " ) , who s chief character trait is the fact that he s from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) .  he s dim-witted , into being part of " the scene , " and soon finds he s become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a  bit like " saturday night fever , "  cept no travolta and no real interest put into him .  poor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been .  shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from " clueless " ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame .  although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that s all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film .  the film s sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) .  rubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that .  notice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who ve only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails .  first time feature director mark christopher proves that he s a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much .  his story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject .  it s as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route .  the studio s recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough .  some people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film s tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini s " la dolce vita " ) , and when i watched " 54 , " i didn t particularly want to stay .

negativeC,' in the past , tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman , and the hilarious ed wood , but lately his films just don t cut it .  sleepy hollow has some unique features , but the script is a terrible mess .  for those who remember disney s fantastic " adventures of ichabod crane " , it is actually superior to this .  disney s version was at least interesting , while burton s film drags on far too long , without any suspense or frights .  while the stories are similar , the new version adds too much to the once likable story , and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off .  ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is now apparently a constable , who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders .  the victims are headless , and no traces of evidence were found , until the murderer reveals himself , hence the headless horseman .  now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy , they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree , that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow .  sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character , but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster .  in the original , the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable .  no one could stop him , not even ichabod .  by the end of the film , it had audiences in deep thought .  burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere , and how to make the main characters heroes .  he takes no risk what so ever , and this is where he fails .  another pathetic element of the film was the script .  like i said earlier , he just stuffed too much in at one time , and made it look real sloppy , kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims .  he completely butchered the story to pieces .  thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked .  the acting by depp was quite notable .  he took the nerdy character of the cartoon , and simply acted it out in a better manner .  if it wasn t for his quirky one-liners , i doubt i could have remained awake , because quite frankly i was getting sleepy .  just when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress , she winds up doing this .  it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster .  it s too tempting to let go , even if the script is mush .  the atmosphere too was quite involving .  i should have just gazed at the sets , and the eerie fog , rather than actually pay attention to what was going on .  at least burton s films are eye candy , even if they are trash .  the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads , and the fight between the horseman , depp and casper van dien .  other than that , i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film , and just sit back and stare at the scenery .  by the end , i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed .  this is the biggest disappointment of the year , especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this .  don t waste your time or money , because your head will feel hollow .

negativeC,' plot : a rich psychiatrist with a great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients .  of course , the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has a few hours to comply with their demands , before they kill his daughter .  pretty good premise , no ?  critique : if you re not a fan of movies packed with plot holes , inconsistencies and yes , even more plot holes , heed my words and skip this hollow thriller .  and i don t like saying that either , since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well .  sure , the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom , primal fear and nick of time pureed into one , but the whole " psychiatrist working against the clock " thing , actually had me engaged at first .  but it s at about the halfway mark of this movie , that the bottom drops out and all that we re left with are a lot of questions and very few plausible answers .  we get the overly smart kid who manages to " pull one " over on the bad guys .  we get a weak woman with her leg in a cast beating the crap out of a tough bad guy .  we get douglas  character , a new york uppedity psychiatrist , suddenly turning into an action hero , with moves and attitude to boot .  and what about the film s main plot point ?  why would the bad guys still give a crap about this thing after 10 years , and even more so , why would they only give the shrink until the day s end to do his part ?   ( you waited 10 years , what s another few days ? - or why not set up another heist instead ? ) .  i ll tell you why , it s because we wouldn t have a ( bad ) movie otherwise , that s why !  and many , many more .  ugh , whatever the case , it was just about the time that douglas  character suddenly removed murphy s character from the mental home ( and how come she went with him so nicely ?  i thought she didn t trust him ) , that i turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into a joke .  and a few bogus chase and action sequences later , we were left with a long-winded ending that did little to answer any other questions i might ve still had , and actually brought up even more contradictions .  badly put together , this movie features some decent acting , some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise , but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone .  in fact , if it wasn t for brittany murphy s excellent portrayal of a traumatized teen , jennifer esposito s embarrassing performance as a police woman ( yeah , right !  watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick- but it wasn t supposed to be ) and michael douglas  cool " regular guy " part , there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture .  incidentally , can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito s character was in this movie in the first place ?  she was completely superfluous .  and on top of all that , by the end of this flick , the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that he d been shoveling out for the hour and a half prior , and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier character s death when one of the bad guys dies , just so we know ( as an audience ) , that the two are interrelated somehow .  ooooh , thanks , mr . fleder . . . i  appreciate the spoon-feeding , dude . . . yum ,  yum . . . but  how about explaining every other plot point in your film that made no sense ?  whatever .  either way , i don t give a rat s ass because this movie is a dog and that s unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it .  see it if you like dumb thrillers .  incidentally , if you appreciated along came a spider , you will likely enjoy this film as well .  they both start off with interesting premises , only to toss all logic and sense out the window about halfway through .  where s joblo coming from ?  along came a spider ( 4/10 ) - girl , interrupted ( 5/10 ) - kiss the girls ( 7/10 ) - primal fear ( 7/10 ) -- seven ( 10/10 ) '
negativeC,' i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world .  and i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it .  writer/director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul-searching in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) , a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country-western lyrics : his pregnant wife drowns , his home is destroyed by a tornado , he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning .  convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant , seth decides to break his , and sets out to turn every " thou shalt not " of the ten commandments into a " thou shalt " ( and vice versa ) .  his wife s sister rachel ( " friends "   courteney cox ) wants to help seth ; rachel s selfish husband harry ( anthony lapaglia ) , who tends to break a few commandments of his own , thinks seth is a lunatic .  thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion .  taplitz isn t interested in treating seth s tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him .  composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth s sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark ; quinn s performance as seth is all wild-eyed fervor without any genuine pain .  the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought , with one through five dispatched in a five-minute montage .  the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high-concept movie plot .  it s not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth .  corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has , while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth s " false witness . "  only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance ; she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve .  even she can t force taplitz to decide whose story this is , or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite .  by the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film , it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience .  commandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith -- and the loss thereof -- at all seriously .

negativeC,' the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment .  with she s all that and varsity blues behind us , and several more set for release later in the year , the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance .  however , you wouldn t know it from the quality of the latest entry : jawbreaker .  this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center .  the most popular , and most feared , clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma .  they have accidentally killed one of their own , the " teen dream " , liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) , choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday .  now the three surviving girls must decide what to do .  it takes little time at all for the group s leader , courtney ( rose mcgowan ) , to decide to cover it up .  the ditzy marcie ( julie benz ) is game to go along , but the clique s final member , julie ( rebecca gayheart ) , has a guilty conscience .  to make things worse , another student , the hopelessly geeky fern mayo ( judy evans greer ) accidentally discovers the truth .  the girls  cover is surely blown . . .  not so fast .  thinking quickly , courtney offers fern a once-in-a-lifetime chance .  after a quick makeover , fern is transformed into vylette , the beautiful " new girl " at school , and a full-fledged member of the popular crowd .  does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder ?  or will this finely honed plan crack over time ?  jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation , and failing miserably , i might add .  it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations , but misses three crucial elements : sharp dialogue , witty characters and the much-needed humor .  it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being ( darkly ) humorous if it wasn t shackled to its dead-weight plot .  the film s most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo .  at this point , jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths .  but then , all of a sudden , the innovation stops .  the film becomes mired in the murder-and-cover-up plotting , which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film .  in the film , rose mcgowan fares the best .  as the manipulative clique leader , she truly dominates every scene she s in ( not a difficult feat in a crowd such as this , however ) .  it s a character crying out for a better movie ( or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact . )  jawbreaker doesn t quite know how to handle its semi-likable characters : fern and julie .  either one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows .  the lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters .  as their motives become murky and unclear , the film finally falls to the point that it doesn t really matter who wins or loses , since all sides have become equally detestable .   " detestable " is a good word to describe the film , jawbreaker .  it s certain that , like the murder weapon described in the film s title , jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience .

negativeC,' `the bachelor  is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see .  wading through this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic .  those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; `the bachelor  is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy .  awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money .  although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy cocoon , chris o donnell has an effortless charm as an actor .  most will recognize him as the high-flying robin from the two latest `batman  films , but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile .  can o donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ?  perhaps , if he found the proper vehicle . . .  but `the bachelor  falls far short of the requirements .  the actor just can t register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success .  a few instances of adorable humor aside , it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is `the bachelor  .  o donnell plays jimmie , a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who s progressing in a serious relationship with anne ( renee zellweger ) .  jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals , and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage .  the problem is that his proposal sucks .  big time .  you can tell things aren t going pleasantly , because jimmie gets the infamous ? deer-in-the-headlights  look when anne questions his approach .  and then , the plot ( along with the stupidity of the movie ) thickens .  jimmie s grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies suddenly , leaving a video will behind for his grandson ( who also happens to be his only living relative ) .  everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie .  of course , there s a catch : he must get married before his 30th birthday , stay joined with his bride for an entire decade , and produce healthy children within the first five years .  the bad news is that jimmie s birthday is the following day .  with anne out of town , he must find a willing bride to share his riches with . . .  and within a very limited time frame .  there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `the bachelor  .  for one , the movie s approach is interesting and not dripping with clich ? .  another is the colorful cast .  o donnell and zellweger are cute together , and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it s own mediocrity .  ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure , and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie s marital adventures .  and now the cons : the approach may be interesting , but in trying an old-fashioned method , director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel .  the characters are drawn with obvious , broad strokes , and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable .  yes , `the bachelor  is far more frustrating than cute .  the screenplay is lamely written , and the subject matter poorly conceived .  the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted , along with whatever promise the film initially contained .  potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor s `colorful  approach , but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director s wishes .  `the bachelor  becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it .  you ve seen the tv spots , haven t you ?  o donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads `what is this man running from ?    in actuality , he s fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune ( it s one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film ) .  after seeing the movie , i believe that the approaching horde could be something else .  o donnell could be running from his angry fans , who have just endured `the bachelor  , and are hunting him down for revenge .

negativeC,' topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil s advocate : movies that have a brilliant beginning but don t know how to end .  it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other .  there is liz , who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment , prue who is getting married , geoff , liz s boyfriend , neil , her previous boyfriend , ant who has written a screenplay .  for the first hour , we get to know these people through everyday activities , as they talk on the phone , go out to dinner , hang clothes on the line .  the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them .  at times , the events border on the ridiculous , like the screening of the film , but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives .  this doesn t sound like a brilliant premise for a film - " we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related " - but it s the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing .  unfortunately this level of honesty isn t maintained .  with about half an hour to go , a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama .  such a disappointment after such a brilliant start .  the actors are all quite good with ms . danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive .  the energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable .  a lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film .  it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles .  that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock .  up till that point , i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place .  while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility , it s unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film .  not just the events , but also the tone of some of the end is wrong , clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it .  this is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film .  as stated above , the first hour is superb and even the end is above average .  it just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss .

negativeC,' the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole . . .  and , in the future , it s also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole .  naturally , this is the setup for the other event horizon . . .  the movie .  when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at , just outside of neptune , the crew of the ship called the " lewis and clark " has to go to investigate , and dr . william weir , the creator of the " event horizon , " gets to come along for the ride .  if you ve glanced at a poster for this movie , you know that , supposedly , what follows is " infinite terror . "  well , i don t know about the " terror " part , but " infinite " certainly seems to qualify . . .  event horizon is a mean-spirited , gory , sick excuse for a film .  it starts off as an alien rip-off , and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes .  at least for those first 40 minutes it s an * interesting * rip-off of alien .  that s a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie , which seems to go on forever .  it not a scary monster movie , nor is it a psychological thriller .  it is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore .  you ve seen this kind of movie before .  the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility .  this is a kind of movie for which i have no respect , a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago .  it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore , but event horizon takes the low road , and the viewers pay the price .  there are many good , respectable performances , from fishburne and neill most noticably .  paul anderson s direction is impressive , as it was in mortal kombat .  there are many nice special effects , mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero-gravity .  the sets are beautiful to gaze upon .  and richard t . jones  character ( cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most characters i ve seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he has .  and none of this can save the movie from being a d-grade level of film .  the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls , a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers , is a promising one .  a haunted house story in space isn t such a bad idea .  but the final execution is extremely disappointing .  that s not to say that philip eisner ( here making his feature film-writing debut ) doesn t have talent .  for those first 40 minutes , he manages to make a tired premise interesting , adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip-off story , and that s something that not too many writers can do .  he even has one scene that , though it also tries to sicken the audience , has a honestly tense feel to it ( the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space ) .  he definitely has something of a gift , but it s not fully on display here .  i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise .  but because of what this movie degenerates into , i have little or no respect , and got little or no enjoyment , out of it .  if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film , then i agree with laurence fishburne s sentiment - " god help us .

negativeC,' there is a rule when it comes to movies .  a sequel is never as good as the original .  there are very few exceptions to this rule , and texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation is not one of them .  now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie , and that this isn t even the first sequel to it , you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience .  don t be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey ( a time to kill ) and renee zellweger ( jerry maguire ) .  they made this movie before they were stars .  judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons .  it s a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey .  apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was , because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger .  apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day .  and i don t blame them , they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them .  unfortunately for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character .  while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control .   ( hey , don t say i didn t warn you . )  to make matters worse , leatherface , the chainsaw wielding maniac , who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times , has now become a full blown cross-dresser , and spends the entire movie in drag .  there is a plot to this movie but it isn t worth mentioning .  let s just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man ( mcconaughey ) and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half-witted sidekick .  man , i can t get over just how bad this movie is .  this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities .  even the obligatory topless babe shot wasn t enough to hold my interest for more than 2 seconds .  the writing is bad , the direction is even worse , but both of those things look good in comparison to the acting .  this is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch .  a guarantee you , if criminals thought that they would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again .

negativeC,' as a hot-shot defense attorney , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients .  he is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness s testimony .  and , on top of that , he s a damn good trial lawyer .  in the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it doesn t hamper lomax s desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal .  his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country , headed by john milton ( al pacino ) .  he is brought to their headquarters in nyc , where he immediately impresses milton , and is subsequently offered a full-time position as head of their newly-created criminal law division .  lomax is soon given the case of his life .  he must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide .  the draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell .  he works late , defends the guilty , pledges his soul to his firm , and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) .  but what starts off as a promising john grisham-like story about conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story .  it begins like a typical parable where a small-town boy makes it big , but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money , power , and greed .  but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm .  quite literally , he is the devil in disguise , and as the movie progresses , he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago .  freaky and frightening things begin to happen , and after much of the film has elasped , milton s horrifying intent is finally revealed .  the movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts .  the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big-city trial lawyer .  the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax .  unfortunately , the two never mix well into a cohesive story , and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere .  granted , the film is very handsome-looking .  you ll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino .  you ll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties .  you ll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann , knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away .  this was one of the better storylines , but unfortunately , is only a sub-plot .  as with all thing s involving the devil , you can expect nothing but the worst .  in the first few scenes , reeves anchors the film , but then slowly drifts into the background .  his path from self-vanity to self-consciousness is never fully explored .  his actions seem arbitrary , and his reasons for them not fully known .  pacino s comical portrayal is spirited , but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie .  there is another plot or two that is introduced , but never gets revisited .  the focus seemed inconsistent throughout , and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap .  this movie tries to be horrifying , thrilling , and dramatic all at the same time .  however , while the devil s advocate strives to get noticed , ultimately it makes very little impression at all .

negativeC,' i m not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick , because i m not sure just what the hell ( pardon the expression ) was going on in it .  however , i can express the most important observation i made of it , i . e .  i didn t like it .  if i had to summarize this film , i think i d conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal .  that s the kernel of it , anyway .  tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women , feminism , the role of the devil , modern reformers , and friendship .  unfortunately , little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts ; they re simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace .  actually , i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was .  they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy , on the level of ghostbusters , and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones .  they laughed , or tried to laugh , at moments that were either barely funny , or much more horrible than funny , as if that could bend the film away from it s rather frightening direction .  three women ( cher , susan sarandon , and michelle pfieffer ) live in eastwick , a small midwestern town .  one night , while drinking late into the evening , they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives .  in seeming answer to their idle daydreams , a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be .  he soon shows evidence of mystical--perhaps demonic--power , and his devotion to the women s merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones .  even worse , when ignored his moods become ugly , and he mistreats the women for spurning him .  anyway , the problems : all three female characters are fairly uninteresting , and several are cardboard stereotypes , especially sarandon s character .  we never get inside them , never feel sympathetic to them , because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland .  as for nicholson , well , even the devil needs a direction to go in , and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie ( due to the grace of the screenwriter and , more importantly , nicholson s acting ) , he still can t be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague .  and then there s the special effects .  not in themselves--they weren t that good--but their overuse .  i was almost positive , until i saw the credits , that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind ( who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl ) , because of the big name actors in dopy stunts , or stephen spielberg , after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson-blown-down-the-street stunt .  nope , it s another bunch of guys , and directed by george miller , who has shown great skill with stunts/special effects before ( the road warrior , " nightmare at 20 , 00 feet " episode of twilight zone : the movie ) but apparently doesn t know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act .  f gawds sake , guys , this is jack nicholson !  let him loose !  let him grin demonically !  skip the splitting earth and fake lightning !  watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll , all i could think of was , " what a waste " .  if you re going to use slapstick like that , use it up on pee wee herman .  nicholson does what he can with the role , and when he can find his bearings , can be extremely good ( the scene in the church , for instance ) , but most of the time , he seems a bit stiff , as if he s not sure what he should be doing next .  and no wonder .  this script goes all over the map , giving you the feeling that it d just love to be allegory , but it s not sure about what-- maybe if you give it time it ll think of something .  so what is the witches of eastwick ?  a horror movie ?  a folk tale ?  a comedy ?  a statement about women ?  an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality ?  i tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me . . . watching  someone regurgitate half-digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms , people , the screen , and ultimately , the audience .  in other words , a mess .   ( $2 . 00 )  if you like nicholson enough to watch him here ; maybe 25% of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others . '
negativeC,' the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes .  alas , it refers to our heroes !  as it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further .  after all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one .  but the human race doesn t have much to worry about .  after all , there s a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus .  she s the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus ) .  they re all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous , abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters .  lucky for us , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board .  the evil captain everton thinks he s going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there s going to be big money , so they try to salvage the ship .  soon , however , when it s apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power , they realize that something bad must have happened .  finally , they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship !  it s creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race !  virus is a truly dumb action thriller , one of negligible intelligence and innovation .  when considering the entire film , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene .  it s a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens , the abyss , and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly , it s basically the same movie as last year s deep rising .  i liked deep rising simply because it s funny -- it knows it s silly and derivative .  virus takes itself seriously .  and , in the most serious manner possible , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre , showing you countless familiar scenes , and sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming .  but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out .  okay , let me get this straight -- the alien race ( which is never really explained ) is basically sentient electricity .  they need to make themselves physical , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water , but who cares about that ) .  on the ship , they make a bunch of clunky , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people .  after that , they start using the dead people to create half-human , half-machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around .  the leader , of course , is a big creature .  every film like this has a big creature at the end , but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around .  virus is indeed a cliched film , but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn t very threatening .  it s established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it , but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there .  on one level , virus is almost passable fun .  it s really gory , and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal ( the director , john bruno , worked on a lot of cameron s films ) .  there s also a nice array of actors , even though none of them do any acting ( except for donald sutherland , who does a lot of very bad acting ) .  the bottom line , however , is this : virus is a bad movie .  it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing .  in that order , i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films , simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes . '
negativeC,' an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis  1981 feature , an american werewolf in london .  where the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit-coms .  where the first installment had chills , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny .  in short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity ) .  the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping .  soon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all .  she jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached , goes after her , and manages to save her ( at the price of a major headache ) .  serafine disappears , but a smitten andy seeks her out .  however , once he learns his would-be girlfriend s dark secret , he wishes he hadn t .  she s a werewolf , cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full , and , to make matters worse , he has suffered a nasty bite himself .  actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie .  she imbues serafine with spirit , spunk , and humanity , which gives us an emotional stake in the character s fate .  this isn t necessarily a good thing , since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless , campy entertainment experience .  delpy s injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her .  delpy s previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski s white and richard linklater s before sunrise .  she was radiant , charismatic , and effective in both .  given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here , she gets as close as possible to those adjectives .  it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris , but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss .  and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff , check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts .  the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy -- which is to say , they give performances appropriate for the screenplay .  tom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the lead like he s in a made-for-tv movie .  it would be kind to call him bland .  actors vince vieluf and phil buckman , as andy s friends , are no more impressive .  julie bowen ( happy gilmore ) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat .  and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal .  on the technical side , it s all bad news .  the computer-generated werewolves look painfully unreal .  the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits .  repeated use is made of the " werewolf cam " , an infrared wolf s point-of-view approach that s interesting the first couple of times it s employed , then becomes tedious .  and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on-screen action they re matched to .  director anthony waller , who displayed a confident , edgy style in mute witness , stumbles with this material , never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel .  as a result , we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii : your sister is a werewolf .   ( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog , though -- something that s rarely seen in movies these days . ) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a " bad movie " sort of way , but that s a dubious distinction .  ultimately , it s an unfortunate effort , for , while it isn t unbearable to sit through , it isn t a howl , either . '
negativeC,' depending on who you ask , the original sin was either the eating of the apple , the act of disobedience against god , or the act of betrayal .  but in case you didn t know this , don t bother remembering it . . .  the words " original sin " never come up in the movie of the same name , let alone the concept of it .  the closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative ( the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba , circa 1900 ) .  regardless of its senseless title , original sin does actually have a plot ( albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war , based on the book waltz across darkness ) .  boy ( antionio banderas ) places personal ad sometime around 1900 , searching for a wife .  since this is a century ago , we narrowly dodge a remake of green card , only to find that the girl ( jolie ) faked her photo and is actually beautiful .  skipping a few moderately useless sex scenes ( getting the question out of the way , yes , we get to see angelina jolie s breasts again ) , the girl turns out to be a con artist , swindles boy for his money , and heads for the hills .  original sin then briefly tries to be a thriller .  we see boy go whore-chasing , saying he wants to find girl and kill her .  but as soon as boy actually finds girl , instead of following what might have been a promising ( or at least not completely fucking boring ) thriller , the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin/whore complex since milk money .  girl toys with the idea of reforming her con-girl past , all the while avoiding the " other man , " a lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place .  add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history ( literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect ) , and acting roughly the caliber of a b . b . gun , and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer , definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year .  don t even bother with original sin , but if you do go , be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal .  just keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block , it s much worse than a sin .  this is sacrilege . '
negativeC,' wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions .  over black and white drawings , we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange , sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation-induced mutation .  the " original " inhabitants of the earth , fairies and elves , return to populate the globe , along with their evil , mutant counterparts .  one day ( and i say " one day " not to be trite , but because that s exactly how it happened - no advance notice ) , a fairy queen gives birth to twins , one good and one evil .  the twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire .  we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology .  as unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out .  there s a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all .  i soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film .  once the transition was made from still art to color animation , an entirely different feel takes precedence .  rather than the epic saga promised by the narration , we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon .  not just the look , mind you , but all the zany sounds like >honk boing  for years , blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined .  however , blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis .  yup , adolf hitler , the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht .  okay , not the real things , but an archival film his minions dug up .  projected into the sky for all to see , it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up .  before you know it , there are dead elves everywhere .  this is just as well .  the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn t care about any of them .  they re either silly , sappy , or both .  the dialog gets much of the credit for this .  an example is when avatar nonchalantly says , " well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle . "  not very formidable when he s also the guy who says , " this is the biggest bummer of a trip i ve ever been on . "  my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can t fight back against the nazi-charged evil .  her response is , " they have weapons and technology .  we just have love . "  suffice to say , the characters are strictly two-dimensional , and we therefore don t expect anything more than the obvious to happen .  which it does .  the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out , which is anticlimactic and disappointing .  please note that it is the action that is unexpected .  that it is disappointing is not .  the film couldn t settle on a particular mood .  it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle .  scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity .  the dramatics , which seem to occur at random , are overly staged and overly acted , detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned .  ralph bakshi , the director , makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film : hitler and the nazis were bad .  so who doesn t know this already ?  well , maybe children .  okay , so you might say that this is a movie for children .  it s not .  in the scenes where good fights evil , there s a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they re watching a cartoon .  so is the film for adults ?  if so , we probably don t need to be bashed over the head to get the point .  why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ?  wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes , and hitler giving speeches .  however , we don t see any reason why they should be considered bad .  we see no atrocities being committed , not even any real battle footage .  there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich , and we re not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place .  this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made , since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment .  i d like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere , at any time , and we must therefore be vigilant .  however , i m not sure if i want to give him that much credit .

negativeC,' inspired by the 1958 film house on haunted hill starring vincent price .  directed by william malone .  starring geoffrey rush , famke janssen , and chris kattan .  rated r ( contains violence , profanity , and brief nudity ) .  synopsis : eccentric millionaire price offers $1 , 000 , 000 to each of his guests who appear at a gathering at a former sanitarium .  the only catch is that they have to survive the night at the establishment , an establishment haunted by its former staff and patients .  comments : house on haunted hill is based upon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price .  in an obvious homage , the millionaire s name is price and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have .  this is a pretty bad horror film , yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining , and house on haunted hill is just such a film .  it is , surprisingly , better than another recent haunted house remake , the haunting , a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson .  the haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face .  house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b-movie 40 years old and makes no illusion that it s a crappy horror movie .  thus , somehow , it proves slightly more successful .  i can t think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast .  it is this cast which lifts this ho-hum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror .  price , the main character , is played by geoffrey rush , the academy-award winning actor of shine .  rush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie industry , a spiral reminiscent of ben ( ghandi , schindler s list ) kingsley s ridiculous appearance in the camp sci-fi classic species .  i don t know why , but sometimes it s entertaining to see " quality " actors in bad movies .  more surprises ?  rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure ( rather lamely too ) , and singer lisa loeb ( ! )  appears as a tv news reporter .  the highlight of the cast , however , has to be saturday night live member chris kattan .  kattan s comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium .  while the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to what s exactly going on , the second half dissolves into standard ghost story stuff and loses some of its suspense .  a disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movie too .  house on haunted hill , i suspect , has just about left the second-run theaters .  it s worth catching on cable next year , if you get a chance .  if you have a choice , pick this movie over the haunting , it s the better of two evils , you could say .  though , more appropriately perhaps , it d be better to say that it s the better of two turkeys .

negativeC,' capsule : liebes meets tod .  this was a film about sex and death .  a morgue attendant accidentally revives a dead woman through necrophilia and brings her into his world which is heavy on orgies .  this film says something obscure about the relationship of sex and death , but imparts no insights .  to make matter worse this print was poorly subtitled into english from french .  0 ( -4 to +4 )  - an attractive 18-year-old dies on a disco floor and gets sent to a morgue .  one of the attendants , ben ( jean-marc barr ) is so attracted by her that he attempts necrophilia .  we see him crawling away after a shock .  in the middle of sex the dead teen has come back to life .  - the morgue attendant was just adding a new form of sex to his collection of kinks .  he was already part of a group that gets together for s/m sex .  the revived teen , teresa ( elodie bouchez ) joins them .  - moral dilemma of teresa s father .  ben has abused his daughter s body , but in doing so has saved her life .  - part of this opaque allegory is a man saved from suicide who joins in the sexual hijinx .  also involved is a man in the final stages of dying of aids , a close friend of the morgue attendant .  he does not get involved in the orgies .  - the subtitles of our print were white , often on a white background making them often hard to read , but i don t think there was a whole lot of meaning there that was lost .  - the title means " don t let me die on a sunday .

negativeC,' you know that a movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing . . . and  it s not a comedy !  and what a strange career path for director chuck russell .  he starts his career off with a decent take on the " nightmare on elm street " series with his debut as director on installment number three .  he follows that up with the blob the very next year , but waits another six years to do his next piece , a little film called the mask starring jim carrey , and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that .  so then he thought , " let me wait another five years , get a weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes " ? ! ?  strange dude and one crappy flick .  plot : a six-year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god .  a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side , while the girl s aunt wants to . . . well ,  save her from those damn devil worshippers !  enter one occult expert agent , plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying , and you ve just about got the gist of things here .  critique : with plot holes the size of my ass , this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich ? -ridden plot , with wasted talent , cheezy effects , bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot .  what s good about this movie ?  well , rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children s shelter/satanist supreme , with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around .  the little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesn t really do all that much .  and believe it or not , i was actually enjoying some of the film s first half hour , which starts off with some promise , but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist , basinger , just drown the film s entire basis of believability .  for some reason , it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted , and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes . . . is  a dumb one !  add that to the entire police force of incompetents , save for jimmy smits ( whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move ?  at least change the clothes , jimmy ! ) , zero scares , zero thrills and even less actual drama , and you ve got yourself a pretty bad movie .  and why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie ?  did they owe the director a favor or something ?  together , they barely have five minutes of screen time , but i suppose that ricci s hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horn-dogs .  the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending , which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of " sneaking up " on a man s house , who they know to be guilty of a crime !  uuuhmm . . . how s  about knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass , officers ? !  anyway , i don t usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof ( and there was plenty to go around ) .  and did basinger lose some of her acting " talent " during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win ?  difficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad , or if she just delivered them poorly .  either way , little originality , very obvious computer effects , little thrills , little drama and very little entertainment value , certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film .  but if you really don t mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and " kid " -based thrillers , and enjoy watching films that don t bring anything new to the table . . . well ,  drink some beers , smoke some beans and rent this video , because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year .

negativeC,' adam sandler vehicles are never anything special , but continue to make a load of money .  which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today .  while good comedies like rushmore , to choose a recent example , gets limited release and doesn t make a lot of money , big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash .  it s also nothing special and doesn t deserve the money it s making .  but i digress .  sandler plays sonny koufax , a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age .  his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him : either wise up and get responsible , or she s leaving him .  by a strange set of events , koufax ends up with julian ( played by twins cole and dylan sprouse ) a five year old kid .  after a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child , koufax decides he wants to keep the child .  however , social worker mr brooks ( mostel ) finds out that koufax isn t the real father and wants to take julian back .  koufax along with his new girlfriend layla ( lauren adams ) fight to keep the child .  big daddy really isn t that good .  many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour , and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny .  there s the occasional good one liner , but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour .  the film , after all these silly gags , then suddenly turns sentimental , and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous .  the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable , and not helped by the soppy overacting .  it s a poor attempt to win over the audience .  adam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films ( except the wedding singer . )  joey lauren adams is much , much better , and deserves a far better film than this trash .  steve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo , and his scenes are pretty funny .  rob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man .  the two twins who play julian are o . k , they start out rather well , but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn  all american  wholesome goodness at the end of the film , where the tear juice is turned up high .  big daddy is really nothing special , and is not even worth it for a few chuckles .  although it is actually well put together , with nice direction , good production design and even some montages , this professionalism can t help the fact that the script and characters are trash .  big daddy is for die hard fans of sandler , and that s about it .

negativeC,' deserves recognition for : making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20  capsule review : this is what feel-good family entertainment has morphed into in the 90 s : an hour-and-a-half commercial , disguised as an unnecessary remake , in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass .   ( between this , rocketman , and george of the jungle , disney has recently eclipsed longtime champion troma as the studio most likely to include a fart joke in a film . )  as the absent-minded professor who invents the titular computer-generated goop , a listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly .  the only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newly-founded but firm belief that writer/producer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments he s used for comedic effect in films like this and the odious home alone series .  take your kids to see boogie nights instead .

negativeC,' any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it .  unfortunately , this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible , directed by brian depalma .  the first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever , aside from the music .  the tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork , orchestrated by jim phelps , allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world .  teamwork was the key .  this film is set up as a cross between james bond and depalma s " blow out , " where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions .  it was travolta s vulnerability that made that film so exciting and claustrophobic .  in this film , tom cruise is basically omniscient ( believe that ? ) and so there s no fun going on here whatsoever .  the story is about as contrived as contrived gets , and is full of holes .  there are basically two memorable sequences : one involves breaking into a kubrickesque computer room -- a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense ( suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room ) ; the second involves a high-speed train , a helicopter , and the chunnel and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved .  the actors are all miscast , especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife , who cannot act , and ving rhames as a computer hacker ( ! ) , who looks lost and embarrased to be in this movie .  tom cruise is no james bond , and jon voight looks more like bobby " the brain " heenan than jim phelps .  brian depalma s career has been bafflingly erratic .  at his best , he beats hitchcock at his own game ( " blow out , " " carrie , " " body double " ) but this is not his best .  the screenplay was partly written by robert towne , who wrote the best scenario of the seventies in " chinatown , " but this script is perfunctory at best , and terrrible at worst .  the cinematography has a comic book red/blue emphasis , which is nice to look at , but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old " killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape " trick .  please don t spend your money on this ; it ll only encourage hollywood to make more .

negativeC,' movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros . , have never generated much interest at the box office .  but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well .  with a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy .  it got my vote for  the movie where i expected the least and got the most  .  and , if you haven t had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video .  in the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth s realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity .  the mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld s minions , which if won , will guarantee earth s safety for another generation .  mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition .  despite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth .  outworld s warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel .  earth s mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld s forces .  it s an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie .  it is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it s comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story .  this becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more .  they are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act .  this becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana .  the original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best .  they spoke little , but fought a lot .  thus , the movie was easy to digest .  however , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably .  this uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak .  not only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic ( e . g .  useless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom .  try reading this half as fast , and you ll hear what i mean .  but the movie is not a complete fatality .  fight scenes are well-choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility .  and players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo .  even if you re not familiar with the video game , each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves .  but it s just too little of what movie-goers and especially fans of the game will expect .  oddly , the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence .  and the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival .   ( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ) .  rent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only . '
negativeC,' if you don t think kevin kline in drag is funny , wait ? til you see will smith in drag-it s even less funny .  by the time jim west ( smith ) disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade , artemus gordon ( kline ) , from the clutches of evil dr . loveless ( branagh ) , i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west , the new summer blockbuster from men in black director barry sonnenfeld .  is the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy , anyway ?   ( if your answer is no , then you recall rustler s rhapsody or back to the future part iii ; if your answer is yes , you re thinking of blazing saddles , but that movie was a parody of the western genre , not a nineteenth century romp . )  1869 . jim west is a quick-draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon , under orders from president grant ( kline again , whose impression , for all we know , is dead-on ) , to apprehend legless loveless , the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain .  how will loveless accomplish this ?  well , by hulking around the desert in an enormous , mechanical tarantula , of course .  bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar ( hayek ) , whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless , joins west and gordon on their gadget-filled train .   ( gordon first discovers rita in a cage , waiting to be rescued . )  racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west , despite the movie s " hip " attitude toward the black thing .   ( west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a " nigger " before that person can finish speaking the word .  super . )  at any rate , i kept waiting for rita to say something humourous , but she s a walking dress-up toy .   ( her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film : she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek-a-boo flap of her pyjamas . )  jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith , whose comic timing has always been hit or miss , as episodes of " the fresh prince of bel-air " demonstrate .  smith s a better reactor than actor , which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in black-he didn t start out a hero .  in wild wild west he s required to exude eastwood cool and amuse at the same time ( and from frame one ) , a difficult feat i m not sure any living performer could pull off .  smith is ill equipped , for example , to handle the moment in which jim west performs stand-up for some rednecks at his own hanging .  what attracted sonnenfeld to this material ?  this isn t the first time he has adapted a tv show for the big screen ( the addams family , anyone ? ) , but it s the first big stinker of his career as a director .  wild wild west is poorly-paced bombast , full of doa gags ( ted levine shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid ; levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs-he s too intense to get an intentional laugh ) , lousy special effects ( the bluescreening is amateurish-foregrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds ) , and frequent illogic .   ( to wit , its ridiculous villain so badly wants jim west out of the way that he . . . drops  him onto a steel platform to do battle with some generic , ugly henchmen , instead of shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board the tarantula . )  wild wild west s bright spots , such as the cool opening credits sequence , bai ling s all-too-brief appearance as a femme fatale , or the brilliant " his master s voice " joke , are all part of the film s first half , which is more clever and enjoyable , at least , than its second .  when , towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west , gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and west rejects it , there was a collective groan among audience members : it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider , the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whiz-bang finale .

negativeC,' if you have ever seen fox tv s special car chase programs , you ll have a good idea about the content of ronin , the new action " thriller " from director john frankenheimer .  the film involves a mysterious briefcase , that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on .  an irish women , dierdre ( played by the truman show s natascha mcelhone ) , hires a group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase .  among the people she hires are sam ( robert de niro ) , vincent ( jean reno ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsg ? rd from good will hunting ) .  dierdre s groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it .  they accomplish this task , but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again .  the briefcase stays on the run , as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed .  the writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie , but failed to understand that just because there are surprises , it doesn t add too the credibility of a senseless script .  the plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on , after the apparent climax of the film .  but to add to the excitement , as i mentioned earlier , there are endless car chase scenes .  they are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story .  don t get me wrong , i love car chases , but they were overdone and too long here .  we never do find out what s in the briefcase , but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller .

negativeC,' the happy bastard s quick movie review  wild wild west  a better name for this movie might ve been " wild wild waste " .  warner bros . , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib s success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad .  but somehow , they ran into a problem along the way .  they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would ve made all the difference- a story writer .  wild wild west s story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon .  if warner bros . had gotten him , the movie would ve possibly been five times better than what it is .  heck , ten times .  as is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he s performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well .  here s the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair .  they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path .  as i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess .  but the acting doesn t help either .  kevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado .  smith seems to be having a better time as west , although he s not nearly as charming as he was in mib .  branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can t even stand to look at him or his strange beard .  and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention .  her acting is barely passable , but what a " breath of fresh ass " .  director barry sonnenfeld isn t of great help either .  even though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost .  it s as if he feels he s directing a tv movie , a big no-no when you re helming what s supposed to be a big-screen hit .  last but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable .  at one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline s train .  he jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it s still in motion !  also , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks .  last but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he s not kissing a woman as he s looking through a peephole at the enemy ? !  the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects .  the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show .  there s also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity .  i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn t possible .  if the racist and sex jokes don t bother you , the performances will .  if the performances don t bother you , the story will .  if the story doesn t bother you , the racist and sex jokes will .  there s no end to the vicious circle .  go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats .  you ll have a better time .  if you do go , keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant .  i bet he wishes he were somewhere else . . .

negativeC,' old soldiers never die , they just turn into cliches  soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman  the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body .  jungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it s difficult to integrate both .  often we ll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung s magician , sit around imagining grand schemes .  without the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams .  warriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy .  they don t care enough about anything to know what s worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle .  this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies .  america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers .  todd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype .  chosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine .  his childhood is cruelty and competition .  he is indoctrinated with the big rules .  never question authority .  winning is everything .  strength beats knowledge .  a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he s obsolete .  a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger .  left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he s unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world .  obviously our hero is still alive .  he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health .  when the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world .  they are the other good guys .  these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons .  todd finds himself in the role of protector .  what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon .  the effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion .  the plot is old hat .  we don t get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers .  hardly anything makes sense .  the film s science fares badly .  with all the remarkable advances we ve made in just 37 years ( the film takes place in 2036 ) , we re still stupid .  after conquering the stars , for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away .  even stranger , the garbage barges appear to double as time machines .  virtually all the trash is vintage 1960 .  there is nothing in the story that is not predictable .  the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra ( connie nielsen ) , the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him .  it doesn t take a genius to foresee that her husband isn t going to be around much longer .  is it a shock to find out that the film s climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine ?  who would you guess wins ?  some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy .  todd s first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie s nipple poking through her thin blouse .  later as he sits by his lonely campfire , a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion .  supposedly this clich ? isn t meant to be humorous .  dastardly col . mekum ( jason isaacs ) with a pencil-thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash .  responsible for last year s quirky and visually enticing but problematic " the fifth element " , director paul anderson sees the film as " shane " in outer space .  maybe , if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode .  the movie doesn t even work as an action film .  there is never a question as to the outcome .  somehow the new superior soldiers don t prove much of a match for todd .  the acting isn t anything to write home about .  nielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim .  russell is buffed-up and does a credible job but it s not much of a challenge .  uttering around 100 words during the film , mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space .  gary busey as todd s commanding officer is completely wasted in his low-key role .  everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool .  sometimes the sets are impressive .  unfortunately " occasionally " and " sometimes " don t make a film .  most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote " blade runner " , possibly the best science fiction movie ever made .  sharp-eyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film .  peoples says that this is not a " blade runner " sequel , but a " sidequel " that takes place in the same universe .  although that may have been the intent in his original script , the result is more like a bad television series that the " blade runner " replicants watch to pass time .  perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining .

negativeC,'  " what is this , a homicide or a bad b-movie ? "  that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie .  let me clear things up for you cupcake , this isn t a bad b-movie , it s a really bad b-movie .  so bad , it s almost good .  almost , but not quite .  the movie starts off in the 1950 s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth .  it is a bunch of slug-like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies .  the slugs  first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody .  that is , until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986 .  he , and the slugs inside him , promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co-eds into slug zombies .  a slightly crazed cop ( tom atkins ) and the requisite girl with the face of an angel ( jill whitlow ) join these two geeky university students ( jason lively and steve marshall ) to do battle with the slugs .  it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs .  the acting is bad with a capital b . the story is worse .  and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie .  the only saving grace was the requisite tit-shot courtesy of jill whitlow .  it had absolutely nothing to do with the story -- but i liked it .  actually , it was the high point of the movie for me .  of course , that isn t really saying much .  the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion .  which gives it a leg up on some other horror films .  unlike most movies of this genre , there actually is a story .  not a great one , but it is there .  this is one in a long line of movies from the 1980 s that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th , halloween and nightmare on elm street movies .  you could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better .  but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b-movie horror marathon .  just don t be too upset if you can t find it .  you really won t be missing that much .

negativeC,' there s a scene early on in " jawbreaker " where a character utters the unintentionally prophetic line , " that is * so * not funny " .  how right she was .  this pathetic tale of three high-schoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is never even remotely funny .  or fun .  or original .  not content with the too-obvious " heathers " heisting , the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of sources , including " carrie " , " bride of frankenstein " , " blue velvet " , and even shaw s pygmalion , itself recently remade as " she s all that " .   " jawbreaker " is a pastiche , and not even an enjoyable one .  i find it extremely telling that the most engaging part of the film is the credit sequence , a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt s " volcano girls " ; serving as a blueprint for the rest of the film , the song has absolutely nothing to do with the footage we re watching .  just close your eyes and pretend you re listening to an alt-rock station ; you won t be missing anything .  the blame for a mess this big has to be spread around among the principals .  rebecca gayheart , following roles in " scream 2 " and " urban legend " , should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie .  pam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten from her role in quentin tarantino s " jackie brown " .  and rose mcgowan should just quit acting .  she has no charisma , no presence , and no acting skills other than rolling her eyes and looking disaffected .  mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real-life boyfriend , rocker marilyn manson , whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of the " real " actors are doing .  manson , sans trademark makeup & contact lenses , and with an obviously fake moustache , looks eerily like nicholas cage ; who woulda thunk it ?  that crack about direction by committee wasn t merely a pithy sound-bite .  stylistically , thematically & narratively , " jawbreaker " is all over the map , varying wildly in tone & content from scene to scene .  though credited solely to writer/director darren stein , one gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the same hands .  if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity , someone needs to get the man some drugs , pronto .  prozac , lithium , kava , ritalin , something , anything .  he s quite obviously in desperate need of chemical help .   " jawbreaker " is a monumental waste of effort and resources , and quite likely one of the single worst films i ve ever seen .  to call " jawbreaker " garbage would be to insult garbage .  bad flicks for the rest of the year are safe ; i ve already got my pick for worst film of  99 .   " jawbreaker " runs approximately 90 minutes , though it feels longer than " titanic " , and is rated r for language , sexual situations and graphic violence .  not recommended for kids , teens , or anyone else .

( there s also a skull in the living room , but it s only for decoration . )  their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming .  all s well for about the first hour of this slow-moving film , until mia eats some of the neighbors  chocolate mousse and passes out .  when she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen .  it seems like a dream and , when she finds herself pregnant , she almost forgets about it .  and everyone s helping with the pregnancy .  the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink , a good-luck charm for her to wear around her neck , and the name of an obstetrician who s been in the business 66 . 6  years .  meanwhile , mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight .  before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries .  that s when you know your health s failing .  the only person in the movie who s the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend ( maurice evans ) who calls mia up to give her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma .  by about the two-hour mark i felt the same way .  rosemary s baby is way too long , and leads up to a payoff that s about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie .  i guess someone put a spell on this movie .

negativeC,'  " the 44 caliber killer has struck again . "  starring john leguizamo , mira sorvino , adrian brody , jennifer esposito , michael rispoli , bebe neuwirth .  rated r .  summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee s abilities .  lee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg .  but here , he gets himself into a bind .  his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work .  the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city .  it was the hottest summer on record .  to boot , new york s first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam , david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population .  so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city .  the movie s focus is on a group of twenty-somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club-hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters .  we follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings .  vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her .  ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more " eccentric , " and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend .  tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam s first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again .  a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects .  at the top of the list is ritchie .  vinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend .  as we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded " so what ? "  question springs to mind .  from the way this movie is made , i d have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find .  lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70 s punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters  very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn t bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement .  all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable .  too bad summer of sam doesn t get any help here .  frankly , it s a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn t entertain beyond its first half hour .  there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague .  leguizamo s turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny .  the script makes it clear that we re supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy .  you d never guess from his performance .  adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better .  sorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i m tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart .  brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for .  summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it s pretty well directed , in a purely technical way .  but it s also empty , pretentious and boring .  like last year s the thin red line , it s a movie by a director who doesn t know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; '
negativeC,' wow , a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever .  i m amazed that someone thought this was a story that must be told on screen .  many blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race .  i think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves , and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sex-crazed buffoons .  even i m offended by it .  bill bellamy is a " player " which means he sleeps with a lot of women and lies to them .  what a pleasant main character .  one day , his friends decide that they want to find out how to be a player .  why they decide this " one day " i have no idea .  how many years have they been friends and why all of a sudden would they want to learn ?  anyway , bellamy agrees to teach , and his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex with women .  this is the bulk of the film folks , guys riding from house to house , one keeps getting out to have sex , while the others sit in the car .  since russell simmons is producer , and since the official title of the film is " def jam s how to be a player " , i was ready to be jumping up and down and stomping my feet and beating the person next to me because of the comedy .  amazingly , aside from gilbert gottfried s 90 seconds of screen time , there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner .  instead of jokes , there s just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts ( and naked breasts aren t so bad , but naked breasts alone don t make a good movie ) .  be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well .  gilbert gottfried s character serves as one in his very brief appearance , asking for explanations as to what is being said .  they should have brought him along for the entire film .

negativeC,' bob the happy bastard s quickie review :  the odd couple ii  grumpy old men , it ain t .  hell , my fellow americans , it ain t .  walter matthau and jack lemmon team up again for an even more worn out vehicle than any of their films over the past few years .  odd couple ii feels terribly generic , where in the first movie , made thirty one years ago , feels like a wonderful tale .  that s like repackaging campbell s soup in a generic food can , really .  how writer neil simon could ve made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me .  throughout the movie , i really didn t laugh once .  honestly .  i mean , there were dumb situations , yeah , like the cropduster who let these old geezers have it without any notice , but they just really didn t seem funny to me .  and that car rolling off the cliff ?  the only way i would ve seen humor in that is if they were still in it .  and the ending gets all super-mushy , too .  in the final twenty minutes or so , lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one , then loses her ; matthau talks to his son ( a wasted jonathan silverman ) about his amrriage to lemmon s daughter ; and , of course , lemmon and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands .  ooh , i really gave a lot away there , i m sure .  consider it a hospitable gester , you won t waste your time renting this muck .
